I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st
Yet if thou say Antony lives is well Or friends with Caesar or not captive to him I’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee
Madam he’s well
Well said
And friends with Caesar
Th’ art an honest man
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever
Make thee a fortune from me
But yet madam  I do not like “But yet” It does allay The good precedence
Fie upon “But yet” “But yet” is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor
Prithee friend Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear The good and bad together
He’s friends with Caesar In state of health thou say’st and thou say’st free
Free madam no
I made no such report
He’s bound unto Octavia
For what good turn
For the best turn i’ th’ bed
I am pale Charmian
Madam he’s married to Octavia
The most infectious pestilence upon thee
Good madam patience
What say you
Hence horrible villain or I’ll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me
I’ll unhair thy head
Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine Smarting in ling’ring pickle
Say ’tis not so a province I will give thee And make thy fortunes proud
The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg
He’s married madam
Rogue thou hast lived too long
Nay then I’ll run
What mean you madam
I have made no fault
Good madam keep yourself within yourself
The man is innocent
Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt
Melt Egypt into Nile and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents
Call the slave again
Though I am mad I will not bite him
Call
He is afeard to come
I will not hurt him
These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself since I myself Have given myself the cause
Come hither sir
Though it be honest it is never good To bring bad news
Give to a gracious message An host of tongues but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt
I have done my duty
Is he married
The gods confound thee
Dost thou hold there still
Should I lie madam
Go get thee hence
I crave your highness’ pardon
He is married
Take no offense that I would not offend you
To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal
He’s married to Octavia
Oh that his fault should make a knave of thee That art not what th’ art sure of
Get thee hence
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me
Lie they upon thy hand And be undone by ’em
Good your highness patience
In praising Antony I have dispraised Caesar
Many times madam
I am paid for ’t now
Lead me from hence
O Iras Charmian
Tis no matter  Go to the fellow good Alexas
Bid him Report the feature of Octavia her years Her inclination
Let him not leave out The color of her hair
Bring me word how tall she is
Lead me to my chamber
Lord Alexas sweet Alexas most anything Alexas almost most absolute Alexas where’s the soothsayer that you praised so to th’ Queen
Oh that I knew this husband which you say must charge his horns with garlands
I make not but foresee
Pray then foresee me one
No you shall paint when you are old
Wrinkles forbid
Vex not his prescience
Be attentive
Hush
You shall be more beloving than beloved
Most meet That first we come to words and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent Which if thou hast considered let us know If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here
What was ’t That moved pale Cassius to conspire
Take your time
Thou canst not fear us Pompey with thy sails
We’ll speak with thee at sea
At land thou know’st How much we do o’ercount thee
At land indeed Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house But since the cuckoo builds not for himself Remain in ’t as thou mayst
Be pleased to tell us  For this is from the present how you take The offers we have sent you
There’s the point
Which do not be entreated to but weigh What it is worth embraced
You have made me offer Of Sicily Sardinia
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates then to send Measures of wheat to Rome
This ’greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted
That’s our offer
Know then I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience
Let me have your hand
I did not think sir to have met you here
The beds i’ th’ East are soft and thanks to you That called me timelier than my purpose hither For I have gained by ’t
Well I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal
Well met here
I hope so Lepidus
Thus we are agreed
That’s the next to do
We’ll feast each other ere we part and let’s Draw lots who shall begin
That will I Pompey
No Antony take the lot
But first or last Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have The fame
I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there
You have heard much
I have fair meanings sir
And fair words to them
Then so much have I heard
And I have heard Apollodorus carried                                                                              What I pray you
How far’st thou soldier
Well And well am like to do for I perceive Four feasts are toward
Let me shake thy hand
I never hated thee
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior
Sir I never loved you much but I ha’ praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did
Enjoy thy plainness
It nothing ill becomes thee  Aboard my galley I invite you all
Will you lead lords
Show ’s the way sir
Come
At sea I think
We have sir
You have done well by water
And you by land
I will praise any man that will praise me though it cannot be denied what I have done by land
Nor what I have done by water
Yes something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea
And you by land
There I deny my land service
But give me your hand Menas
If our eyes had authority here they might take two thieves kissing
All men’s faces are true whatsome’er their hands are
But there is never a fair woman has a true face
No slander
They steal hearts
We came hither to fight with you
For my part I am sorry it is turned to a drinking
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
If he do sure he cannot weep ’t back again
You’ve said sir
We looked not for Mark Antony here
Pray you is he married to Cleopatra
Caesar’s sister is called Octavia
True sir
She was the wife of Caius Marcellus
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius
Pray ye sir
Tis true
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together
If I were bound to divine of this unity I would not prophesy so
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties
I think so too
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity
Octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation
Who would not have his wife so
Not he that himself is not so which is Mark Antony
He will to his Egyptian dish again
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar and as I said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance
Antony will use his affection where it is
He married but his occasion here
And thus it may be
Come sir will you aboard
I have a health for you
I shall take it sir
We have used our throats in Egypt
Come let’s away
Here they’ll be man
Some o’ their plants are ill rooted already
Lepidus is high colored
They have made him drink alms drink
I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave
Thus do they sir they take the flow o’ th’ Nile By certain scales i’ th’ Pyramid
They know By th’ height the lowness or the mean if dearth Or foison follow
The higher Nilus swells The more it promises
As it ebbs the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain And shortly comes to harvest
You’ve strange serpents there
Ay Lepidus
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun
I am not so well as I should be but I’ll ne’er out
Not till you have slept
I fear me you’ll be in till then
Nay certainly I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things
Without contradiction I have heard that
What manner o’ thing is your crocodile
It is shaped sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth
It is just so high as it is and moves with its own organs
Of it own color too
Tis a strange serpent
Tis so
And the tears of it are wet
The matter
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes
Thou hast served me with much faith
What’s else to say                                                         These quicksands Lepidus Keep off them for you sink
What sayst thou
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world
That’s twice
How should that be
Nay hear him
Good now some excellent fortune
Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all
Oh excellent
Then belike my children shall have no names
Prithee how many boys and wenches must I have
If every of your wishes had a womb And fertile every wish a million
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes
We’ll know all our fortunes
Mine and most of our fortunes tonight shall be drunk to bed
Hast thou drunk well
No Pompey I have kept me from the cup
Show me which way
These three world sharers these competitors Are in thy vessel
All there is thine
Ah this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on ’t
In me ’tis villainy In thee ’t had been good service
Thou must know ’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor Mine honor it
Repent that e’er thy tongue Hath so betrayed thine act
Being done unknown I should have found it afterwards well done But must condemn it now
Desist and drink
This health to Lepidus
Here’s to thee Menas
Enobarbus welcome
There’s a strong fellow Menas
Why
He bears The third part of the world man
Seest not
The third part then is drunk
Drink thou
Come
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast
It ripens towards it
Strike the vessels ho
Here’s to Caesar
I could well forbear ’t
Be a child o’ th’ time
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one
Let’s ha ’t good soldier
Come let’s all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe
All take hands
What needs more words
Good night
And shall sir
Give ’s your hand
We are friends
Come down into the boat
Take heed you fall not
Menas I’ll not on shore
No to my cabin
What
There’s my cap
Hoo
Noble captain come
Now darting Parthia art thou struck and now Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus’ death Make me revenger
For learn this Silius Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away
Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person
Who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain’s captain and ambition The soldier’s virtue rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him
I could do more to do Antonius good But ’twould offend him and in his offense Should my performance perish
Thou hast Ventidius that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction
Thou wilt write to Antony
I’ll humbly signify what in his name That magical word of war we have effected How with his banners and his well paid ranks The ne’er yet beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o’ th’ field
Where is he now
What are the brothers parted
They have dispatched with Pompey he is gone
Octavia weeps To part from Rome
Caesar is sad and Lepidus Since Pompey’s feast as Menas says is troubled With the greensickness
A very fine one
Oh how he loves Caesar
Nay but how dearly he adores Mark Antony
Caesar
What’s Antony
The god of Jupiter
Spake you of Caesar
How the nonpareil
O Antony O thou Arabian bird
Would you praise Caesar say “Caesar” Go no further
Indeed he plied them both with excellent praises
But he loves Caesar best yet he loves Antony
Hoo
Hearts tongues figures scribes bards poets cannot Think speak cast write sing number hoo  His love to Antony
Both he loves
They are his shards and he
So This is to horse
Adieu noble Agrippa
Good fortune worthy soldier and farewell
No further sir
For better might we Have loved without this mean if on both parts This be not cherished
Make me not offended In your distrust
I have said
You shall not find Though you be therein curious the least cause For what you seem to fear
So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends
We will here part
Farewell my dearest sister fare thee well
The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort
Fare thee well
My noble brother
The April’s in her eyes it is love’s spring And these the showers to bring it on
What Octavia
I’ll tell you in your ear
Look here I have you
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods
Adieu
Be happy
Farewell farewell
Farewell
E’en as the o’erflowing Nilus presageth famine
Go you wild bedfellow you cannot soothsay
Nay if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication I cannot scratch mine ear Prithee tell her but a workaday fortune
Your fortunes are alike
But how but how
Give me particulars
I have said
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she
Well if you were but an inch of fortune better than I where would you choose it
Not in my husband’s nose
Our worser thoughts heavens mend
Alexas
For as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose wived so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded
Therefore dear Isis keep decorum and fortune him accordingly
Where is the fellow
Half afeard to come
Go to go to Come hither sir
Good majesty Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased
That Herod’s head I’ll have
Most gracious majesty
Didst thou behold Octavia
Ay dread Queen
Where
Madam in Rome
I looked her in the face and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony
Is she as tall as me
She is not madam
Didst hear her speak
Is she shrill tongued or low
Madam I heard her speak
She is low voiced
That’s not so good
He cannot like her long
Like her
O Isis ’tis impossible
I think so Charmian
She creeps
She shows a body rather than a life A statue than a breather
Is this certain
Or I have no observance
Three in Egypt Cannot make better note
There’s nothing in her yet
The fellow has good judgment
Excellent
Charmian hark
And I do think she’s thirty
Bear’st thou her face in mind
Is ’t long or round
Round even to faultiness
For the most part too they are foolish that are so
Her hair what color
Brown madam and her forehead As low as she would wish it
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill
I will employ thee back again I find thee Most fit for business
Go make thee ready Our letters are prepared
A proper man
Indeed he is so
I repent me much That so I harried him
Nothing madam
All may be well enough
I warrant you madam
O my good lord Believe not all or if you must believe Stomach not all
A more unhappy lady If this division chance ne’er stood between Praying for both parts
Gentle Octavia Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it
The meantime lady I’ll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother
The Jove of power make me most weak most weak Your reconciler
When it appears to you where this begins Turn your displeasure that way for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them
Provide your going Choose your own company and command what cost Your heart has mind to
How now friend Eros
There’s strange news come sir
What man
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey
This is old
What is the success
So the poor third is up till death enlarge his confine
Then world thou hast a pair of chaps no more And throw between them all the food thou hast They’ll grind the one the other
Where’s Antony
More Domitius My lord desires you presently
My news I might have told hereafter
Twill be naught But let it be
Bring me to Antony
Come sir
Contemning Rome he has done all this and more In Alexandria
Here’s the manner of ’t I’ th’ marketplace on a tribunal silvered Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned
This in the public eye
She In th’ habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared and oft before gave audience As ’tis reported so
Let Rome be thus informed
Who queasy with his insolence already Will their good thoughts call from him
The people knows it and have now received His accusations
Who does he accuse
Caesar and that having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled we had not rated him His part o’ th’ isle
Then does he say he lent me Some shipping unrestored
Sir this should be answered
Tis done already and the messenger gone
I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change
He’ll never yield to that
Nor must not then be yielded to in this
Hail Caesar and my lord
Hail most dear Caesar
That ever I should call thee castaway
You have not called me so nor have you cause
Why have you stol’n upon us thus
You come not Like Caesar’s sister
The wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher and The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear
Nay the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven Raised by your populous troops
We should have met you By sea and land supplying every stage With an augmented greeting
My lord Mark Antony Hearing that you prepared for war acquainted My grievèd ear withal whereon I begged His pardon for return
Which soon he granted Being an obstruct ’tween his lust and him
Amen
Hush
Here comes Antony
Saw you my lord
No lady
Was he not here
No madam
He was disposed to mirth but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him Enobarbus
Madam
Here at your service
My lord approaches
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field
Against my brother Lucius
Ay
Do not say so my lord
Where is he now
My lord in Athens
No my most wrongèd sister
Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her
He hath given his empire Up to a whore who now are levying The kings o’ th’ earth for war
He hath assembled Bocchus the King of Libya Archelaus Of Cappadocia Philadelphos King Of Paphlagonia the Thracian king Adallas King Manchus of Arabia King of Pont Herod of Jewry Mithridates King Of Comagen Polemon and Amyntas The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia With a more larger list of scepters
Ay me most wretched That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That does afflict each other
Welcome hither
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger
Cheer your heart
Best of comfort And ever welcome to us
Welcome lady
Welcome dear madam
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you
Only th’ adulterous Antony most large In his abominations turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us
Most certain
Sister welcome
Pray you Be ever known to patience
My dear’st sister
But why why why
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And sayst it is not fit
Is ’t not denounced against us
Why should not we Be there in person
What is ’t you say
Sink Rome
And their tongues rot That speak against us
A charge we bear i’ th’ war And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man
Speak not against it
I will not stay behind
Nay I have done
Here comes the Emperor
Is it not strange Canidius That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne You have heard on ’t sweet
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent
By sea what else
Why will My lord do so
For that he dares us to ’t
So hath my lord dared him to single fight
Ay and to wage this battle at Pharsalia Where Caesar fought with Pompey
But these offers Which serve not for his vantage he shakes off And so should you
In Caesar’s fleet Are those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought
Their ships are yare yours heavy
No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea Being prepared for land
I’ll fight at sea
But if we fail We then can do ’t at land
Thy business
The news is true my lord
He is descried
Canidius Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land And our twelve thousand horse
How now worthy soldier
O noble Emperor do not fight by sea
Trust not to rotten planks
Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds
Let th’ Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a ducking
We Have used to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot
Well well away
By Hercules I think I am i’ th’ right
Soldier thou art but his whole action grows Not in the power on ’t
So our leader’s led And we are women’s men
You keep by land The legions and the horse whole do you not
Marcus Octavius Marcus Justeius Publicola and Caelius are for sea But we keep whole by land
This speed of Caesar’s Carries beyond belief
While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies
Who’s his lieutenant hear you
They say one Taurus
Well I know the man
The Emperor calls Canidius
With news the time’s with labor and throws forth Each minute some
Taurus
My lord
Strike not by land keep whole
Provoke not battle Till we have done at sea
Our fortune lies Upon this jump
Set we our squadrons on yond side o’ th’ hill In eye of Caesar’s battle from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly
I can behold no longer
Gods and goddesses All the whole synod of them
What’s thy passion
The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance
We have kissed away Kingdoms and provinces
How appears the fight
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt  Whom leprosy o’ertake i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same or rather ours the elder The breeze upon her like a cow in June Hoists sails and flies
That I beheld
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view
Well what worst
The nature of bad news infects the teller
When it concerns the fool or coward
On
Things that are past are done with me
Tis thus Who tells me true though in his tale lie death I hear him as he flattered
O my lord
Speak to me home
Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome
Oh then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still and our ills told us Is as our earing
Fare thee well awhile
I never saw an action of such shame
Experience manhood honor ne’er before Did violate so itself
Alack alack
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably
Had our general Been what he knew himself it had gone well
Oh he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own
Ay are you thereabouts
Why then good night indeed
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse
Hark
Friends come hither
I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way forever
I have a ship Laden with gold
Fly And make your peace with Caesar
Fly
Not we
I have fled myself and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders
Friends begone
I have myself resolved upon a course Which has no need of you
Begone
Oh I followed that I blush to look upon
My very hairs do mutiny for the white Reprove the brown for rashness and they them For fear and doting
Friends begone
You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you
Pray you look not sad Nor make replies of loathness
Take the hint Which my despair proclaims
Let that be left Which leaves itself
To the seaside straightway
I will possess you of that ship and treasure
Leave me I pray a little
Pray you now Nay do so for indeed I have lost command
Why what else
Let me sit down
Oh fie fie fie
Madam
Madam O good Empress
The Queen my lord the Queen
Go to him madam speak to him
He is unqualitied with very shame
Well then sustain me
Most noble sir arise
The Queen approaches
Her head’s declined and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue
I have offended reputation A most unnoble swerving
Sir the Queen
Oh whither hast thou led me Egypt
O my lord my lord Forgive my fearful sails
I little thought You would have followed
Egypt thou knew’st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings And thou shouldst tow me after
O’er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew’st and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me
Oh my pardon
Now I must To the young man send humble treaties dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness who With half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased Making and marring fortunes
You did know How much you were my conqueror and that My sword made weak by my affection would Obey it on all cause
Fall not a tear I say
One of them rates All that is won and lost
Give me a kiss
Even this repays me  We sent our schoolmaster
Let him appear that’s come from Antony
Know you him
Approach and speak
Such as I am I come from Antony
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea
Be ’t so
Declare thine office
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and Requires to live in Egypt which not granted He lessens his requests and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens
This for him
Next Cleopatra does confess thy greatness Submits her to thy might and of thee craves The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs Now hazarded to thy grace
For Antony I have no ears to his request
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail so she From Egypt drive her all disgracèd friend Or take his life there
This if she perform She shall not sue unheard
So to them both
Fortune pursue thee
Bring him through the bands
Caesar I go
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw And what thou think’st his very action speaks In every power that moves
Caesar I shall
What shall we do Enobarbus
Think and die
Is Antony or we in fault for this
Antony only that would make his will Lord of his reason
Why should he follow
The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed he being The merèd question
Twas a shame no less Than was his loss to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing
Prithee peace
Is that his answer
Ay my lord
The Queen shall then have courtesy so she Will yield us up
He says so
Let her know ’t  And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities
That head my lord
A messenger from Caesar
What no more ceremony
See my women Against the blown rose may they stop their nose That kneeled unto the buds Admit him sir
At your noble pleasure
He stays upon your will
What are you
Fulvia thy wife is dead
Where died she
In Sicyon
Her length of sickness with what else more serious Importeth thee to know this bears
Forbear me
Caesar’s will
Hear it apart
None but friends
Say boldly
So haply are they friends to Antony
He needs as many sir as Caesar has Or needs not us
If Caesar please our master Will leap to be his friend
For us you know Whose he is we are and that is Caesar’s
So  Thus then thou most renowned Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand’st Further than he is Caesar
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love but as you feared him
Oh
He is a god and knows What is most right
Mine honor was not yielded But conquered merely
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him
For he partly begs To be desired to give
It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon
But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud The universal landlord
What’s your name
My name is Thidias
Most kind messenger Say to great Caesar this in deputation I kiss his conqu’ring hand
Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at ’s feet and there to kneel
Favors
By Jove that thunders
What art thou fellow
You will be whipped
Take hence this jack and whip him
Moon and stars
Whip him
Were ’t twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here what’s her name Since she was Cleopatra
Whip him fellows Till like a boy you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy
Take him hence
This jack of Caesar’s shall Bear us an errand to him
Good my lord  You have been a boggler ever
But when we in our viciousness grow hard  Oh misery on ’t the wise gods seel our eyes In our own filth drop our clear judgments make us Adore our errors laugh at ’s while we strut To our confusion
Oh is ’t come to this
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar’s trencher
Nay you were a fragment Of Gneius Pompey’s besides what hotter hours Unregistered in vulgar fame you have Luxuriously picked out
For I am sure Though you can guess what temperance should be You know not what it is
Wherefore is this
Soundly my lord
Cried he
And begged he pardon
He did ask favor
Have you done yet
Alack our terrene moon is now eclipsed And it portends alone the fall of Antony
To flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points
Not know me yet
Coldhearted toward me
Ah dear if I be so From my cold heart let heaven engender hail And poison it in the source and the first stone Drop in my neck
As it determines so Dissolve my life
The next Caesarion smite Till by degrees the memory of my womb Together with my brave Egyptians all By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey
I am satisfied
Caesar sits down in Alexandria where I will oppose his fate
Our force by land Hath nobly held
Our severed navy too Have knit again and fleet threat’ning most sealike
Where hast thou been my heart
Dost thou hear lady
If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips I will appear in blood
I and my sword will earn our chronicle
There’s hope in ’t yet
That’s my brave lord
I will be treble sinewed  hearted  breathed And fight maliciously
For when mine hours Were nice and lucky men did ransom lives Of me for jests but now I’ll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me
Come Let’s have one other gaudy night
Call to me All my sad captains
Let’s mock the midnight bell
It is my birthday
I had thought t’ have held it poor but since my lord Is Antony again I will be Cleopatra
We will yet do well
Do so
We’ll speak to them and tonight I’ll force The wine peep through their scars Come on my Queen There’s sap in ’t yet
Now he’ll outstare the lightning
When valor preys on reason It eats the sword it fights with
I will seek Some way to leave him
He calls me “boy” and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die meantime Laugh at his challenge
Give him no breath but now Make boot of his distraction
Never anger Made good guard for itself
Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight
Within our files there are Of those that served Mark Antony but late Enough to fetch him in
See it done And feast the army
We have store to do ’t And they have earned the waste
Poor Antony
What’s your pleasure sir
I must with haste from hence
Why then we kill all our women
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them
If they suffer our departure death’s the word
I must be gone
Under a compelling occasion let women die
It were pity to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing
Cleopatra catching but the least noise of this dies instantly
I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment
I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a celerity in dying
She is cunning past man’s thought
We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears
He will not fight with me Domitius
No
Why should he not
He thinks being twenty times of better fortune He is twenty men to one
Tomorrow soldier By sea and land I’ll fight
Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again
Woo’t thou fight well
I’ll strike and cry “Take all”                                                           Well said
Come on
Call forth my household servants
Let’s tonight Be bounteous at our meal
You have served me well And kings have been your fellows
The gods forbid
Well my good fellows wait on me tonight
Scant not my cups and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too And suffered my command
Look they weep And I an ass am onion eyed
Ho ho ho
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus
Grace grow where those drops fall
My hearty friends You take me in too dolorous a sense For I spake to you for your comfort did desire you To burn this night with torches
Know my hearts I hope well of tomorrow and will lead you Where rather I’ll expect victorious life Than death and honor
Brother good night
Tomorrow is the day
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets
Nothing
What news
Belike ’tis but a rumor
Good night to you
Well sir good night
Soldiers have careful watch
And you
Here we
And if tomorrow Our navy thrive I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up
Tis a brave army and full of purpose
Peace
What noise
Hark
Music i’ th’ air
Under the earth
It signs well does it not
No
Peace I say
What should this mean
How now masters
Ay
Is ’t not strange
Do you hear masters
Do you hear
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter Let’s see how it will give off
Content
Tis strange
Sleep a little
Come good fellow put thine iron on
If fortune be not ours today it is Because we brave her
Come
Nay I’ll help too
What’s this for
Ah let be let be
Thou art The armorer of my heart
False false
This this
Sooth la I’ll help
Thus it must be
Well well We shall thrive now Seest thou my good fellow
Go put on thy defenses
Briefly sir
Is not this buckled well
Rarely rarely
Dispatch O love That thou couldst see my wars today and knew’st The royal occupation
Good morrow to thee
Welcome
Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to ’t with delight
A thousand sir Early though ’t be have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you
The morn is fair
Good morrow General
Good morrow General
Tis well blown lads
This morning like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note begins betimes
Fare thee well dame
Whate’er becomes of me This is a soldier’s kiss
I’ll leave thee Now like a man of steel
Lead me
He goes forth gallantly
The gods make this a happy day to Antony
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land
Hadst thou done so The kings that have revolted and the soldier That has this morning left thee would have still Followed thy heels
Who’s gone this morning
Who
One ever near thee
Sir He is with Caesar
Sir his chests and treasure He has not with him
Is he gone
Most certain
Go Eros send his treasure after
Do it
Detain no jot I charge thee
Write to him  I will subscribe gentle adieus and greetings
Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master
Oh my fortunes have Corrupted honest men
Dispatch Enobarbus
Fulvia is dead
Sir
Fulvia is dead
Fulvia
Dead
Why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice
If there were no more women but Fulvia then had you indeed a cut and the case to be lamented
This grief is crowned with consolation
Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow
The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you especially that of Cleopatra’s which wholly depends on your abode
No more light answers
Let our officers Have notice what we purpose
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part
For not alone The death of Fulvia with more urgent touches Do strongly speak to us but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home
Much is breedingWhich like the courser’s hair hath yet but life And not a serpent’s poison
Say our pleasure To such whose place is under us requires Our quick remove from hence
Go forth Agrippa and begin the fight
Our will is Antony be took alive
Make it so known
Caesar I shall
The time of universal peace is near
Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the vant That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him
Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment but No honorable trust
I have done ill Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more
Enobarbus Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure with His bounty overplus
The messenger Came on my guard and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules
I give it you
Mock not Enobarbus
I tell you true
Best you safed the bringer Out of the host
I must attend mine office Or would have done ’t myself
Your Emperor Continues still a Jove
I am alone the villain of the earth And feel I am so most
O Antony Thou mine of bounty how wouldst thou have paid My better service when my turpitude Thou dost so crown with gold
This blows my heart
If swift thought break it not a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought but thought will do ’t I feel
I fight against thee
No I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die
The foul’st best fits My latter part of life
Retire
We have engaged ourselves too far
Caesar himself has work and our oppression Exceeds what we expected
O my brave Emperor this is fought indeed
Had we done so at first we had droven them home With clouts about their heads
Thou bleed’st apace
I had a wound here that was like a “T” But now ’tis made an “H”                                                        They do retire
We’ll beat ’em into bench holes
I have yet Room for six scotches more
They are beaten sir and our advantage serves For a fair victory
Let us score their backs And snatch ’em up as we take hares behind
Tis sport to maul a runner
I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor
Come thee on
I’ll halt after
We have beat him to his camp
Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests
Tomorrow Before the sun shall see ’s we’ll spill the blood That has today escaped
Lord of lords
O infinite virtue com’st thou smiling from The world’s great snare uncaught
Mine nightingale We have beat them to their beds
What girl though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown yet ha’ we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth
Behold this man
He hath fought today As if a god in hate of mankind had Destroyed in such a shape
He has deserved it were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus’ car
If we be not relieved within this hour We must return to th’ court of guard
O bear me witness night  What man is this
Stand close and list him
Be witness to me O thou blessèd moon When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent
Enobarbus
Peace
Hark further
Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault Which being dried with grief will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts
O Antony
Let’s speak to him
Let’s hear him for the things he speaks may concern Caesar
Let’s do so
But he sleeps
Swoons rather for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep
Go we to him
Awake sir awake
Speak to us
Hear you sir
The hand of death hath raught him
Let us bear himTo th’ court of guard
He is of note
Our hourIs fully out
Come on then
He may recover yet
I shall do ’t
Their preparation is today by sea
We please them not by land
For both my lord
I would they’d fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air We’d fight there too
But this it is our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us
To the vales And hold our best advantage
Yet they are not joined
Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all
I’ll bring thee word Straight how ’tis like to go
Swallows have built In Cleopatra’s sails their nests
All is lost
This foul Egyptian hath betrayèd me
Triple turned whore
Bid them all fly For when I am revenged upon my charm I have done all
Bid them all fly
Begone
O sun thy uprise shall I see no more
Fortune and Antony part here
Even here Do we shake hands
All come to this
Betrayed I am
Oh this false soul of Egypt
Ah thou spell
Avaunt
Why is my lord enraged against his love
Vanish or I shall give thee thy deserving And blemish Caesar’s triumph
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians
Follow his chariot like the greatest spot Of all thy sex
Most monsterlike be shown For poor’st diminutives for dolts and let Patient Octavia plow thy visage up With her preparèd nails
She dies for ’t Eros ho
Help me my women
To th’ monument
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off
Say that the last I spoke was “Antony” And word it prithee piteously
Hence Mardian And bring me how he takes my death
Eros thou yet behold’st me
Ay noble lord
Thou hast seen these signs
Ay my lord
That which is now a horse even with a thought The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct As water is in water
It does my lord
My good knave Eros now thy captain is Even such a body
Here I am Antony Yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave
Nay weep not gentle Eros
Oh thy vile lady
She has robbed me of my sword
Hence saucy eunuch
Peace
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death
Death of one person can be paid but once And that she has discharged
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand
The last she spake Was “Antony most noble Antony” Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony
It was divided Between her heart and lips
She rendered life Thy name so buried in her
Dead then
Dead
Unarm Eros
Go
Off pluck off
O cleave my sides
Heart once be stronger than thy continent
Crack thy frail case Apace Eros apace
No more a soldier
Bruisèd pieces go
You have been nobly borne
I will o’ertake thee Cleopatra and Weep for my pardon
Since the torch is out Lie down and stray no farther
Now all labor Mars what it does
Yea very force entangles Itself with strength
Seal then and all is done  Eros I come my Queen Eros Stay for me
Where souls do couch on flowers we’ll hand in hand And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze
Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops And all the haunt be ours Come Eros Eros
What would my lord
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness
Do ’t
The time is come
Thou strik’st not me ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st
Put color in thy cheek
The gods withhold me
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts Though enemy lost aim and could not
Eros Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms bending down His corrigible neck his face subdued To penetrative shame whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar drawn before him branded His baseness that ensued
I would not see ’t
Draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country
O sir pardon me
When I did make thee free swor’st thou not then To do this when I bade thee
Do it at once Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed
Draw and come
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies
Lo thee
Where is he
I did not see him since
What should I do I do not
In each thing give him way
Cross him in nothing
Tempt him not so too far
I wish forbear
In time we hate that which we often fear
But here comes Antony
I am sick and sullen
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose  Help me away dear Charmian
I shall fall
My sword is drawn
My dear master My captain and my emperor let me say Before I strike this bloody stroke farewell
Tis said man and farewell
Farewell great chief
Shall I strike now
Now Eros
Why there then
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony’s death
My Queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record
To do thus I learned of thee
How
Not dead
Oh dispatch me
What’s the noise
I have done my work ill friends
Oh make an end Of what I have begun
The star is fall’n
And time is at his period
Alas and woe
Let him that loves me strike me dead
Not I
Nor I
Nor anyone
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly
This sword but shown to Caesar with this tidings Shall enter me with him
Where’s Antony
There Diomed there
Lives he
Wilt thou not answer man
Art thou there Diomed
Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death
Most absolute lord My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee
When did she send thee
Now my lord
Where is she
Locked in her monument
She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass
For when she saw  Which never shall be found you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar and that your rage Would not be purged she sent you word she was dead
Too late good Diomed
Call my guard I prithee
What ho the Emperor’s guard
Bear me good friends where Cleopatra bides
Tis the last service that I shall command you
Woe woe are we sir you may not live to wear All your true followers out
Most heavy day
Nay good my fellows do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us and we punish it Seeming to bear it lightly
Take me up
I have led you oft carry me now good friends And have my thanks for all
O Charmian I will never go from hence
Be comforted dear madam
No I will not
All strange and terrible events are welcome But comforts we despise
Our size of sorrow Proportioned to our cause must be as great As that which makes it
How now
Is he dead
His death’s upon him but not dead
O Antony Antony Antony
Help Charmian help Iras help
Peace
Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself
So it should be that none but Antony Should conquer Antony but woe ’tis so
Nay but this dotage of our general’s O’erflows the measure
Those his goodly eyes That o’er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars now bend now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front
His captain’s heart Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy’s lust
Look where they come
Take but good note and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet’s fool
Behold and see
If it be love indeed tell me how much
There’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned
I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved
Then must thou needs find out new heaven new earth
News my good lord from Rome
I am dying Egypt dying
Only I here importune death awhile until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips
I dare not dear Dear my lord pardon I dare not Lest I be taken
Not th’ imperious show Of the full fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me
If knife drugs serpents have Edge sting or operation I am safe
Your wife Octavia with her modest eyes And still conclusion shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me
Assist good friends
Oh quick or I am gone
Here’s sport indeed
How heavy weighs my lord
Had I great Juno’s power The strong winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove’s side
And welcome welcome
Die when thou hast lived
Had my lips that power Thus would I wear them out
A heavy sight
I am dying Egypt dying
Give me some wine and let me speak a little
My resolution and my hands I’ll trust None about Caesar
Now my spirit is going
I can no more
Noblest of men woo’t die
Hast thou no care of me
Shall I abide In this dull world which in thy absence is No better than a sty
My lord
Oh withered is the garland of the war
The soldier’s pole is fall’n
Young boys and girls Are level now with men
The odds is gone And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon
She’s dead too our sovereign
Lady
Madam
O madam madam madam
Royal Egypt Empress
Peace peace Iras
No more but e’en a woman and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares
All’s but naught
How do you women
What what good cheer
Why how now Charmian
My noble girls
Good sirs take heart
We’ll bury him and then what’s brave what’s noble Let’s do ’t after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us
Come away
This case of that huge spirit now is cold
Ah women women
Come
We have no friend But resolution and the briefest end
Go to him Dolabella bid him yield
Being so frustrate tell him he mocks The pauses that he makes
Caesar I shall
Wherefore is that
And what art thou that dar’st Appear thus to us
I am called Dercetus
Mark Antony I served who best was worthy Best to be served
Whilst he stood up and spoke He was my master and I wore my life To spend upon his haters
If thou pleasest not I yield thee up my life
What is ’t thou say’st
I say O Caesar Antony is dead
The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack
The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens
The death of Antony Is not a single doom
In the name lay A moiety of the world
Now my dearest Queen  Pray you stand farther from me
What’s the matter
I know by that same eye there’s some good news
What says the married woman you may go
Would she had never given you leave to come
Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here
I have no power upon you
Hers you are
The gods best know                                               Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted
Cleopatra  Why should I think you can be mine and true  Though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods  Who have been false to Fulvia
Riotous madness To be entangled with those mouth made vows Which break themselves in swearing
When you sued staying Then was the time for words
No going then
Eternity was in our lips and eyes Bliss in our brows’ bent none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven
They are so still Or thou the greatest soldier of the world Art turned the greatest liar
This is his sword
I robbed his wound of it
Behold it stained With his most noble blood
Look you sad friends The gods rebuke me but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings
His taints and honors Waged equal with him
A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity but you gods will give us Some faults to make us men
Caesar is touched
I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day Or look on thine
Hear me good friends 
But I will tell you at some meeter season
The business of this man looks out of him
We’ll hear him what he says
Bid her have good heart
She soon shall know of us by some of ours How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her for Caesar cannot live To be ungentle
So the gods preserve thee
Come hither Proculeius
Go and say We purpose her no shame
Go And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her
Caesar I shall
Gallus go you along
Where’s Dolabella To second Proculeius
Dolabella
Let him alone for I remember now How he’s employed
He shall in time be ready
Go with me and see What I can show in this
Tis paltry to be Caesar
Not being Fortune he’s but Fortune’s knave A minister of her will
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean’st to have him grant thee
What’s thy name
My name is Proculeius
Antony Did tell me of you bade me trust you but I do not greatly care to be deceived That have no use for trusting
If your master Would have a queen his beggar you must tell him That majesty to keep decorum must No less beg than a kingdom
If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks
Be of good cheer
You’re fall’n into a princely hand
Fear nothing
Let me report to him Your sweet dependency and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneeled to
Pray you tell him I am his fortune’s vassal and I send him The greatness he has got
I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience and would gladly Look him i’ th’ face
This I’ll report dear lady
You see how easily she may be surprised
Royal Queen
O Cleopatra
Hold worthy lady hold
Do not yourself such wrong who are in this Relieved but not betrayed
What of death too That rids our dogs of languish
Cleopatra Do not abuse my master’s bounty by Th’ undoing of yourself
Let the world see His nobleness well acted which your death Will never let come forth
Where art thou Death
Come hither come
Come come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars
Oh temperance lady
This mortal house I’ll ruin Do Caesar what he can
Know sir that I Will not wait pinioned at your master’s court Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia
Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome
Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me
Rather on Nilus’ mud Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies Blow me into abhorring
Rather make My country’s high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar
Proculeius What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows And he hath sent for thee
For the Queen I’ll take her to my guard
So Dolabella It shall content me best
Be gentle to her
Most noble Empress you have heard of me
I cannot tell
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams
Is ’t not your trick
I understand not madam
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony
Oh such another sleep that I might see But such another man
His reared arm Crested the world
For his bounty There was no winter in ’t an autumn ’twas That grew the more by reaping
In his livery Walked crowns and crownets
Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket
Cleopatra  Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of
Gentle madam no
You lie up to the hearing of the gods
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy yet t’ imagine An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy Condemning shadows quite
Hear me good madam
Your loss is as yourself great and you bear it As answering to the weight
Would I might never O’ertake pursued success but I do feel By the rebound of yours a grief that smites My very heart at root
I thank you sir
Know you what Caesar means to do with me
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew
Arise you shall not kneel
I pray you rise
Sir the gods Will have it thus
Take to you no hard thoughts
I’ll take my leave
And may through all the world
Tis yours and we Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall Hang in what place you please
Here my good lord
How now lady
I would I had thy inches
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt
Hear me Queen The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile but my full heart Remains in use with you
Our Italy Shines o’er with civil swords
Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome
My more particular And that which most with you should safe my going Is Fulvia’s death
Can Fulvia die
She’s dead my Queen
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra
This is the brief of money plate and jewels I am possessed of
Tis exactly valued Not petty things admitted
Where’s Seleucus
Here madam
This is my treasurer
Let him speak my lord Upon his peril that I have reserved To myself nothing
Madam I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not
What have I kept back
Enough to purchase what you have made known
Nay blush not Cleopatra
See Caesar
Oh behold How pomp is followed
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild
Thou shalt Go back I warrant thee
But I’ll catch thine eyes Though they had wings
Oh rarely base
Cleopatra Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest
Still be ’t yours
Bestow it at your pleasure and believe Caesar’s no merchant to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold
Therefore be cheered
No dear Queen For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel
Feed and sleep
Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend
And so adieu
My master and my lord
Not so
Adieu
But hark thee Charmian
Finish good lady
Madam I will
Where’s the Queen
Behold sir
Dolabella
Make your best use of this
I have performed Your pleasure and my promise
Dolabella I shall remain your debtor
I your servant
Adieu good Queen
I must attend on Caesar
Farewell and thanks
Now Iras what think’st thou
Thou an Egyptian puppet shalt be shown In Rome as well as I
Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons rules and hammers shall Uplift us to the view
The gods forbid
Nay ’tis most certain Iras
Oh the good gods
Nay that’s certain
I’ll never see ’t
For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes
Why that’s the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents
Now Charmian
Show me my women like a queen
Go fetch My best attires
Wherefore’s this noise
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness’ presence
He brings you figs
Let him come in
What poor an instrument May do a noble deed
He brings me liberty
My resolution’s placed and I have nothing Of woman in me
Now from head to foot I am marble constant
Now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine
This is the man
Avoid and leave him
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there That kills and pains not
Truly I have him but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him for his biting is immortal
Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover
Remember’st thou any that have died on ’t
Very many men and women too
Truly she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm
But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do
But this is most falliable the worm’s an odd worm
I wish you all joy of the worm
Farewell
You must think this look you that the worm will do his kind
Ay ay
Farewell
Look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in the worm
Very good
Will it eat me
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman
Well get thee gone
Farewell
Give me my robe
Put on my crown
I have Immortal longings in me
Yare yare good Iras quick
Methinks I hear Antony call
I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act
I hear him mock The luck of Caesar which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath Husband I come
Now to that name my courage prove my title
I am fire and air my other elements I give to baser life So have you done
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips
Farewell kind Charmian
Iras long farewell
Have I the aspic in my lips
Dost fall
If thou and nature can so gently part The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch Which hurts and is desired
Dost thou lie still
If thus thou vanishest thou tell’st the world It is not worth leave taking
Dissolve thick cloud and rain that I may say The gods themselves do weep
Come thou mortal wretch With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie
Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch
Oh couldst thou speak That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied
O eastern star
Peace peace
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast That sucks the nurse asleep
As sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle  O Antony Nay I will take thee too
What should I stay  In this wild world
So fare thee well
Now boast thee Death in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled
Downy windows close
And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal
Your crown’s awry
I’ll mend it and then play  Where’s the Queen
Speak softly
Wake her not
Caesar hath sent                                         Too slow a messenger
Oh come apace dispatch
I partly feel thee
There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar
Call him
What work is here Charmian
Is this well done
It is well done and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings
Ah soldier
How goes it here
All dead
Caesar thy thoughts Touch their effects in this
Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought’st to hinder
O most false love
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water
Now I see I see In Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be
By the fire That quickens Nilus’ slime I go from hence Thy soldier servant making peace or war As thou affects
Cut my lace Charmian come
But let it be
I am quickly ill and well So Antony loves
My precious Queen forbear And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial
So Fulvia told me
I prithee turn aside and weep for her
Then bid adieu to me and say the tears Belong to Egypt
O sir you are too sure an augurer
That you did fear is done
The manner of their deaths
I do not see them bleed
Who was last with them
A simple countryman that brought her figs
This was his basket
Poisoned then
Oh Caesar This Charmian lived but now
She stood and spake
I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped
Oh noble weakness
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood and something blown
The like is on her arm
This is an aspic’s trail and these fig leaves Have slime upon them such as th’ aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument
She shall be buried by her Antony
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous
Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral And then to Rome
Come Dolabella see High order in this great solemnity
You’ll heat my blood
No more
You can do better yet but this is meetly
Now by my sword                                               And target
I’ll leave you lady
Courteous lord one word
Sir you and I must part but that’s not it
Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this
But sir forgive me Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you
Your honor calls you hence
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly And all the gods go with you
Upon your sword Sit laurel victory and smooth success Be strewed before your feet
Let us go
Come
Our separation so abides and flies That thou residing here goes yet with me And I hence fleeting here remain with thee
You are too indulgent
Say this becomes him  As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness
If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for ’t
Here’s more news
Pompey is strong at sea And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar
I should have known no less
It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wished until he were And the ebbed man ne’er loved till ne’er worth love Comes deared by being lacked
Caesar I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas famous pirates Make the sea serve them which they ear and wound With keels of every kind
Many hot inroads They make in Italy the borders maritime Lack blood to think on ’t and flush youth revolt
Antony Leave thy lascivious wassails
When thou once Wast beaten from Modena where thou slew’st Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel Did famine follow whom thou fought’st against Though daintily brought up with patience more Than savages could suffer
Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at
Tis pity of him
Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome
Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i’ th’ field and to that end Assemble we immediate council
Pompey Thrives in our idleness
Tomorrow Caesar I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time
Till which encounter It is my business too
Farewell
Farewell my lord
Charmian
Madam
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away
You think of him too much
Oh ’tis treason
Madam I trust not so
What’s your highness’ pleasure
Not now to hear thee sing
I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has
Tis well for thee That being unseminared thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt
Hast thou affections
Yes gracious madam
Indeed
Not in deed madam for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done
Stands he or sits he
Or does he walk
Or is he on his horse
O happy horse to bear the weight of Antony
He’s speaking now Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile” For so he calls me
Now I feed myself With most delicious poison
Think on me That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time
Nay hear them Antony
Perform ’t or else we damn thee”                                                                   How my love
Perchance
Nay and most like
You must not stay here longer
Call in the messengers
As I am Egypt’s queen Thou blushest Antony and that blood of thine Is Caesar’s homager
The messengers
Sovereign of Egypt hail
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony
Yet coming from him that great med’cine hath With his tinct gilded thee
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony
Last thing he did dear Queen He kissed the last of many doubled kisses  This orient pearl
Mine ear must pluck it thence
Good friend” quoth he “Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster at whose foot To mend the petty present I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms
All the East Say thou shall call her mistress” So he nodded And soberly did mount an arm gaunt steed Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him
What was he sad or merry
Like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes Of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
Note him Note him good Charmian ’tis the man but note him
He was not sad for he would shine on those That make their looks by his
He was not merry Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy but between both
O heavenly mingle
Be’st thou sad or merry The violence of either thee becomes So does it no man else Mett’st thou my posts
Ay madam twenty several messengers
Why do you send so thick
Who’s born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar
Ink and paper Charmian
Welcome my good Alexas
Did I Charmian Ever love Caesar so
Oh that brave Caesar
Be choked with such another emphasis
Say “the brave Antony”                                                 The valiant Caesar
By Isis I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men
By your most gracious pardon I sing but after you
My salad days When I was green in judgment cold in blood To say as I said then
We ignorant of ourselves Beg often our own harms which the wise powers Deny us for our good so find we profit By losing of our prayers
I shall do well
The people love me and the sea is mine
My powers are crescent and my auguring hope Says it will come to th’ full
Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner and will make No wars without doors
Caesar gets money where He loses hearts
Lepidus flatters both Of both is flattered but he neither loves Nor either cares for him
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field
A mighty strength they carry
Where have you this
Tis false
From Silvius sir
He dreams
I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony
But all the charms of love Salt Cleopatra soften thy wanned lip
Let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts Keep his brain fuming
This is most certain that I shall deliver Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected
Since he went from Egypt ’tis A space for farther travel
His soldiership Is twice the other twain
But let us rear The higher our opinion that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck The ne’er lust wearied Antony
I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together
I know not Menas How lesser enmities may give way to greater
Be ’t as our gods will have ’t
It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands
Come Menas
Good Enobarbus ’tis a worthy deed And shall become you well to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech
I shall entreat him To answer like himself
By Jupiter Were I the wearer of Antonio’s beard I would not shave ’t today
Tis not a time for private stomaching
But small to greater matters must give way
Not if the small come first
Here comes the noble Antony
And yonder Caesar
Tis spoken well
Were we before our armies and to fight I should do thus
Welcome to Rome
Thank you
Sit
Sit sir
Nay then
I must be laughed at If or for nothing or a little I Should say myself offended and with you Chiefly i’ th’ world more laughed at that I should Once name you derogately when to sound your name It not concerned me
My being in Egypt Caesar what was ’t to you
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt
Yet if you there Did practice on my state your being in Egypt Might be my question
How intend you “practiced”
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me
Your wife and brother Made wars upon me and their contestation Was theme for you
You were the word of war
You do mistake your business
My brother never Did urge me in his act
Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours And make the wars alike against my stomach Having alike your cause
Of this my letters Before did satisfy you
If you’ll patch a quarrel As matter whole you have to make it with It must not be with this
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me but You patched up your excuses
Not so not so
I know you could not lack I am certain on ’t Very necessity of this thought that I Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace
As for my wife I would you had her spirit in such another
The third o’ th’ world is yours which with a snaffle You may pace easy but not such a wife
For that you must But say I could not help it
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria
Three kings I had newly feasted and did want Of what I was i’ th’ morning
But next day I told him of myself which was as much As to have asked him pardon
Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife
Hear the ambassadors
No messenger but thine and all alone Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people
You have broken The article of your oath which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with
Soft Caesar
No Lepidus let him speak
The honor is sacred which he talks on now Supposing that I lacked it But on Caesar
The article of my oath
To lend me arms and aid when I required them The which you both denied
Neglected rather And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge
Tis noble spoken
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you
Worthily spoken Maecenas
Or if you borrow one another’s love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of Pompey return it again
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do
Thou art a soldier only
Therefore speak no more
Go to then
Give me leave Caesar
Speak Agrippa
Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side Admired Octavia
Great Mark Antony Is now a widower
Say not so Agrippa
If Cleopatra heard you your reproof Were well deserved of rashness
I am not married Caesar
Let me hear Agrippa further speak
By this marriage All little jealousies which now seem great And all great fears which now import their dangers Would then be nothing
Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her
Will Caesar speak
The power of Caesar and His power unto Octavia
May I never To this good purpose that so fairly shows Dream of impediment
There’s my hand
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly
Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts and never Fly off our loves again
Happily amen
I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me
Time calls upon ’s
Of us must Pompey presently be sought Or else he seeks out us
Where lies he
What is his strength by land
Great and increasing
But by sea he is an absolute master
So is the fame
Let us Lepidus not lack your company
Noble Antony not sickness should detain me
Good Enobarbus
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested
You stayed well by ’t in Egypt
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there
Is this true
This was but as a fly by an eagle
We had much more monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
She’s a most triumphant lady if report be square to her
I will tell you
The poop was beaten gold Purple the sails and so perfumèd that The winds were lovesick with them
The oars were silver Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made The water which they beat to follow faster As amorous of their strokes
On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids With divers colored fans whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool And what they undid did
Oh rare for Antony
Upon her landing Antony sent to her Invited her to supper
She replied It should be better he became her guest Which she entreated
Royal wench
Now Antony must leave her utterly
Age cannot wither her nor custom stale Her infinite variety
Other women cloy The appetites they feed but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies for vilest things Become themselves in her that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish
Let us go
Good Enobarbus make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here
Humbly sir I thank you
All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you
Good night
If you can your reason
But yet hie you to Egypt again
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher Caesar’s or mine
Caesar’s
Therefore O Antony stay not by his side
Thy dæmon that thy spirit which keeps thee is Noble courageous high unmatchable Where Caesar’s is not
But near him thy angel Becomes afeard as being o’erpowered
Therefore Make space enough between you
Rest you happy
Speak this no more
To none but thee no more but when to thee
If thou dost play with him at any game Thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck He beats thee ’gainst the odds
Thy luster thickens When he shines by
I will to Egypt
And though I make this marriage for my peace I’ th’ East my pleasure lies
O come Ventidius
You must to Parthia
Your commission’s ready
Follow me and receive ’t
Trouble yourselves no further
Pray you hasten Your generals after
Sir Mark Antony Will e’en but kiss Octavia and we’ll follow
Till I shall see you in your soldiers’ dress Which will become you both farewell
Your way is shorter
My purposes do draw me much about
You’ll win two days upon me
Sir good success
Farewell
Give me some music
Music moody food Of us that trade in love
The music ho
Let it alone
Let’s to billiards
Come Charmian
My arm is sore
As well as I can madam
I’ll none now
Give me mine angle
We’ll to th’ river
There My music playing far off I will betray Tawny finned fishes
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears That long time have been barren
Madam madam  Antonio’s dead
If thou say so villain Thou kill’st thy mistress
But well and free If thou so yield him there is gold and here My bluest veins to kiss a hand that kings Have lipped and trembled kissing
First madam he is well
Why there’s more gold
But sirrah mark we use To say the dead are well
Bring it to that The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill uttering throat
Good madam hear me
Well go to I will
But there’s no goodness in thy face if Antony Be free and healthful so tart a favor To trumpet such good tidings
If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son As you have whispered faithfully you were And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face Be truly welcome hither
I am the duke That loved your father
The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me Good old man Thou art right welcome as thy master is
Support him by the arm
Give me your hand And let me all your fortunes understand
Not see him since
Sir sir that cannot be
But were I not the better part made mercy I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge thou present
But look to it Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is
Bring him dead or living Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth Of what we think against thee
Oh that your Highness knew my heart in this I never loved my brother in my life
More villain thou Well push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands
Do this expediently and turn him going
Hang there my verse in witness of my love
And how like you this shepherd’s life Master Touchstone
Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life it is naught
In respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life
Now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious
Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd
Such a one is a natural philosopher
Wast ever in court shepherd
No truly
Then thou art damned
Nay I hope
Your reason
Why if thou never wast at court thou never saw’st good manners if thou never saw’st good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation
Thou art in a parlous state shepherd
Not a whit Touchstone
Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
Instance briefly
Come instance
Why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you know are greasy
Why do not your courtier’s hands sweat
And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man
A better instance I say
Come
Besides our hands are hard
Your lips will feel them the sooner
Come
Most shallow man
Thou worms' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed
Learn of the wise and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat
Mend the instance shepherd
You have too courtly a wit for me
I’ll rest
Good morrow to your Worship
Can you tell if Rosalind the duke’s daughter be banished with her father
Where will the old duke live
Wilt thou rest damned
God help thee shallow man
God make incision in thee thou art raw
That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked pated old cuckoldly ram out of all reasonable match
Here comes young Master Ganymede my new mistress’s brother
No jewel is like Rosalind
Her worth being mounted on the wind Through all the world bears Rosalind
All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind
Let no fair be kept in mind But the fair of Rosalind
I’ll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted
It is the right butter women’s rank to market
Out fool
For a taste If a hart do lack a hind Let him seek out Rosalind
If the cat will after kind So be sure will Rosalind
Winter garments must be lined So must slender Rosalind
They that reap must sheaf and bind Then to cart with Rosalind
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind Such a nut is Rosalind
He that sweetest rose will find Must find love’s prick and Rosalind
This is the very false gallop of verses
Why do you infect yourself with them
Peace you dull fool
I found them on a tree
Truly the tree yields bad fruit
You have said but whether wisely or no let the forest judge
Peace
But upon the fairest boughs Or at every sentence end Will I “Rosalinda” write Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show
Therefore heaven nature charged That one body should be filled With all graces wide enlarged
Nature presently distilled Helen’s cheek but not her heart Cleopatra’s majesty Atalanta’s better part Sad Lucretia’s modesty
Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised Of many faces eyes and hearts To have the touches dearest prized
Heaven would that she these gifts should have And I to live and die her slave
Didst thou hear these verses
Oh yes I heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear
Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees
Is it a man
And a chain that you once wore about his neck
Change you color
I prithee who
O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter
Nay but who is it
Is it possible
Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is
O wonderful wonderful and most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all whooping
Good my complexion dost thou think though I am caparisoned like a man I have a doublet and hose in my disposition
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery
I prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace
I would thou couldst stammer that thou might’st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at all
I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings
So you may put a man in your belly
Is he of God’s making
What manner of man
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
Nay he hath but a little beard
Why God will send more if the man will be thankful
Let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin
It is young Orlando that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both in an instant
Nay but the devil take mocking
I' faith coz ’tis he
Orlando
Orlando
What did he when thou saw’st him
What said he
How looked he
Wherein went he
What makes him here
Did he ask for me
Where remains he
How parted he with thee
And when shalt thou see him again
Answer me in one word
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel
Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled
But take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance
I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn
It may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit
Give me audience good madam
Proceed
There lay he stretched along like a wounded knight
Though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground
Cry “holla” to thy tongue I prithee
It curvets unseasonably
He was furnished like a hunter
Oh ominous
He comes to kill my heart
I would sing my song without a burden
Thou bring’st me out of tune
Do you not know I am a woman
When I think I must speak
Sweet say on
You bring me out
Soft comes he not here
Tis he
I thank you for your company but good faith I had as lief have been myself alone
And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you too for your society
God be wi' you
Let’s meet as little as we can
I do desire we may be better strangers
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill  favoredly
Rosalind is your love’s name
Yes just
I do not like her name
What stature is she of
Just as high as my heart
You are full of pretty answers
The worst fault you have is to be in love
Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue
I am weary of you
There I shall see mine own figure
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher
I’ll tarry no longer with you
Farewell good Signior Love
I am glad of your departure
Adieu good Monsieur Melancholy
Very well
What would you
You should ask me what time o' day
There’s no clock in the forest
Then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock
Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a matter
I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall
Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well
Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would be loath to foil him as I must for my own honor if he come in
Therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will
Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite
I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it but he is resolute
I’ll tell thee Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of ambition an envious emulator of every man’s good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother
Therefore use thy discretion
I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger
I speak but brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
And why not the swift foot of time
Had not that been as proper
By no means sir
Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons
I’ll tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal
I prithee who doth he trot withal
Who ambles time withal
These time ambles withal
Who doth he gallop withal
Who stays it still withal
With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves
Where dwell you pretty youth
Are you native of this place
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling
I have been told so of many
But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love
I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I am not a woman to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women
There were none principal
I prithee recount some of them
No I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of Rosalind
I am he that is so love shaked
I pray you tell me your remedy
There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you
He taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner
What were his marks
A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but I pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue
Then your hose should be ungartered your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe untied and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation
But you are no such man
You are rather point device in your accouterments as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other
Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love
Me believe it
But in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired
I swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too
Yet I profess curing it by counsel
Did you ever cure any so
Yes one and in this manner
I would not be cured youth
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me
Now by the faith of my love I will
Tell me where it is
Go with me to it and I’ll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live
Will you go
With all my heart good youth
Nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you go
Come apace good Audrey
I will fetch up your goats Audrey
Doth my simple feature content you
Your features Lord warrant us
What features
Truly I would the gods had made thee poetical
I do not know what “poetical” is
Is it honest in deed and word
Is it a true thing
No truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
I do truly for thou swear’st to me thou art honest
Now if thou wert a poet I might have some hope thou didst feign
Would you not have me honest
No truly unless thou wert hard favored for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
Well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods make me honest
I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul
Well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter
But what though
Courage
Well that is the dowry of his wife ’tis none of his own getting
Horns
Even so
Poor men alone
No no
The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal
Is the single man therefore blessed
No
As a walled town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor
Here comes Sir Oliver Sir Oliver Martext you are well met
Will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel
Is there none here to give the woman
I will not take her on gift of any man
Truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful
How do you sir
You are very well met
God 'ild you for your last company
I am very glad to see you
Even a toy in hand here sir
Nay pray be covered
Will you be married motley
As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling
And will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar
Get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is
Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
Go thou with me and let me counsel thee
Come sweet Audrey
We must be married or we must live in bawdry Farewell good Master Oliver not 'Tis no matter
Ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling
Never talk to me
I will weep
Do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man
But have I not cause to weep
As good cause as one would desire
Therefore weep
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread
I am heartily glad I came hither to you
If he come tomorrow I’ll give him his payment
If ever he go alone again I’ll never wrestle for prize more
Farewell good Charles
But it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all
You have heard him swear downright he was
He attends here in the forest on the duke your father
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him
So he laughed and let me go
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando
Oh that’s a brave man
Who comes here
Mistress and master you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love Who you saw sitting by me on the turf Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love
Sweet Phoebe do not scorn me
Do not Phoebe
Say that you love me not but say not so In bitterness
Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down Or if thou canst not Oh for shame for shame Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
But now mine eyes Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not
Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes That can do hurt
O dear Phoebe If ever as that ever may be near  You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love’s keen arrows make
But till that time Come not thou near me
And when that time comes Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not As till that time I shall not pity thee
But mistress know yourself
Down on your knees And thank heaven fasting for a good man’s love For I must tell you friendly in your ear Sell when you can you are not for all markets
Cry the man mercy love him take his offer
So take her to thee shepherd
Besides I like you not
Will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard
Come sister Shepherdess look on him better And be not proud
Though all the world could see None could be so abused in sight as he
Sweet Phoebe pity me
Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius
If you do sorrow at my grief in love By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined
Thou hast my love
Is not that neighborly
I would have you
Why that were covetousness
But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed
Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile
Not very well but I have met him oft And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of
Think not I love him though I ask for him
Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well  But what care I for words
Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear
It is a pretty youth not very pretty  But sure he’s proud and yet his pride becomes him
He’ll make a proper man
He is not very tall yet for his years he’s tall
His leg is but so so and yet ’tis well
There was a pretty redness in his lip A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek ’twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask
For what had he to do to chide at me
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And now I am remembered scorned at me
I marvel why I answered not again
But that’s all one omittance is no quittance
I’ll write to him a very taunting letter And thou shalt bear it
Wilt thou Silvius
Phoebe with all my heart
I will be bitter with him and passing short
Go with me Silvius
I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee
They say you are a melancholy fellow
I am so
I do love it better than laughing
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards
Why ’tis good to be sad and say nothing
Why then ’tis good to be a post
I have neither the scholar’s melancholy which is emulation nor the musician’s which is fantastical nor the courtier’s which is proud nor the soldier’s which is ambitious nor the lawyer’s which is politic nor the lady’s which is nice nor the lover’s which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness
A traveler
By my faith you have great reason to be sad
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands
Yes I have gained my experience
And your experience makes you sad
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad  and to travel for it too
Good day and happiness dear Rosalind
My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise
I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry
Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier
Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure
Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee
Well I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours
By mine honor I will and when I break that oath let me turn monster
Therefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry
From henceforth I will coz and devise sports
Let me see what think you of falling in love
Break an hour’s promise in love
Pardon me dear Rosalind
Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight
I had as lief be wooed of a snail
Of a snail
Besides he brings his destiny with him
What’s that
Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for
But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife
Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous
And I am your Rosalind
Rosalind of a better leer than you
Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humor and like enough to consent
What would you say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind
I would kiss before I spoke
Nay you were better speak first and when you were graveled for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss
Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking God warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss
How if the kiss be denied
Who could be out being before his beloved mistress
Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit
Am not I your Rosalind
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her
No faith die by attorney
The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love cause
Then love me Rosalind
Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all
And wilt thou have me
Ay and twenty such
What sayest thou
Are you not good
I hope so
Why then can one desire too much of a good thing  Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sister
Pray thee marry us
I will
Ay but when
Why now as fast as she can marry us
Then you must say “I take thee Rosalind for wife” I take thee Rosalind for wife
I might ask you for your commission but I do take thee Orlando for my husband
So do all thoughts
They are winged
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her
Forever and a day
Say “a day” without the “ever” No no Orlando men are April when they woo December when they wed Maids are May when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives
I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock  pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey
I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry
I will laugh like a hyena and that when thou art inclined to sleep
But will my Rosalind do so
Oh but she is wise
Or else she could not have the wit to do this
The wiser the waywarder
Make the doors upon a woman’s wit and it will out at the casement
Shut that and ’twill out at the keyhole
Stop that ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney
A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say “Wit whither wilt”Nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbor’s bed
You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue
Oh that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool
For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee
I must attend the duke at dinner
By two o'clock I will be with thee again
Ay go your ways go your ways
I knew what you would prove
My friends told me as much and I thought no less
Tis but one cast away and so come death
Two o'clock is your hour
Ay sweet Rosalind
Therefore beware my censure and keep your promise
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind
So adieu
Well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try
Adieu
You have simply misused our sex in your love prate
We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest
O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love
Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out
No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep I am in love
I’ll tell thee Aliena I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando
I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come
And I’ll sleep
Which is he that killed the deer
Yes sir
Sing it
Tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough
How say you now
Is it not past two o'clock
And here much Orlando
Look who comes here
No I protest I know not the contents
Phoebe did write it
What shall be our sport then
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
No
When Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by Fortune fall into the fire
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument
Come come you are a fool And turned into the extremity of love
I say she never did invent this letter
This is a man’s invention and his hand
Sure it is hers
Why she defies me Like Turk to Christian
Women’s gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant rude invention Such Ethiop words blacker in their effect Than in their countenance
Will you hear the letter
So please you for I never heard it yet Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty
She Phoebes me
Mark how the tyrant writes
That a maiden’s heart hath burned
Call you this railing
Why thy godhead laid apart Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart
Not to be endured
It is no boast being asked to say we are
Orlando doth commend him to you both And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin
Are you he
Some of my shame if you will know of me What man I am and how and why and where This handkercher was stained
I pray you tell it
He threw his eye aside  And mark what object did present itself Under an old oak whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity A wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair Lay sleeping on his back
This seen Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother his elder brother
Oh I have heard him speak of that same brother And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men
But to Orlando did he leave him there Food to the sucked and hungry lioness
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so But kindness nobler ever than revenge And nature stronger than his just occasion Made him give battle to the lioness Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling From miserable slumber I awaked
Are you his brother
Was ’t you he rescued
Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him
Twas I but ’tis not I I do not shame To tell you what I was since my conversion So sweetly tastes being the thing I am
But for the bloody napkin
By and by
Brief I recovered him bound up his wound And after some small space being strong at heart
Many will swoon when they do look on blood
There is more in it Cousin Ganymede
Look he recovers
I would I were at home
We’ll lead you thither
I pray you will you take him by the arm
Be of good cheer youth
You a man
You lack a man’s heart
I do so I confess it
Ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited
Heigh ho
This was not counterfeit
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest
Counterfeit I assure you
Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
So I do
But i' faith I should have been a woman by right
Come you look paler and paler
That will I for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother Rosalind
I shall devise something
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him
Will you go
We shall find a time Audrey
Patience gentle Audrey
Faith the priest was good enough for all the old gentleman’s saying
A most wicked Sir Oliver Audrey a most vile Martext
But Audrey there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you
Here comes the man you mean
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown
How old are you friend
Five and twenty sir
A ripe age
Is thy name William
William sir
A fair name
Wast born i' th' forest here
Ay sir I thank God
Thank God” A good answer
Art rich
Faith sir so so
So so” is good very good very excellent good
And yet it is not it is but so so
Art thou wise
Ay sir I have a pretty wit
Why thou sayst well
Give me your hand
Art thou learned
No sir
Then learn this of me to have is to have
For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink being poured out of a cup into a glass by filling the one doth empty the other
He sir that must marry this woman
Therefore you clown abandon which is in the vulgar “leave” the society which in the boorish is “company” of this female which in the common is “woman” which together is abandon the society of this female or clown thou perishest or to thy better understanding diest or to wit I kill thee make thee away translate thy life into death thy liberty into bondage
I will deal in poison with thee or in bastinado or in steel
I will bandy with thee in faction
I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways
Therefore tremble and depart
Do good William
God rest you merry sir
Our master and mistress seeks you
Come away away
Trip Audrey trip Audrey I attend I attend
Mistress you must come away to your father
Were you made the messenger
Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes and swore by his honor the mustard was naught
Now I’ll stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge
Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave
By our beards (if we had them) thou art
By my knavery (if I had it) then I were
Is ’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her
It shall be to your good for my father’s house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate upon you and here live and die a shepherd
You have my consent
Let your wedding be tomorrow
Thither will I invite the duke and all’s contented followers
Go you and prepare Aliena for look you here comes my Rosalind
And you fair sister
O my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf
It is my arm
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion
They are in the very wrath of love and they will together
Clubs cannot part them
They shall be married tomorrow and I will bid the duke to the nuptial
But Oh how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes
By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart heaviness by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for
Why then tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind
I can live no longer by thinking
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you are
Believe then if you please that I can do strange things
I have since I was three year old conversed with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her
I know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger
Speak’st thou in sober meanings
By my life I do which I tender dearly though I say I am a magician
Look here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers
I care not if I have
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd
Good shepherd tell this youth what ’tis to love
It is to be all made of sighs and tears And so am I for Phoebe
And I for Ganymede
And I for Rosalind
And I for no woman
It is to be all made of faith and service And so am I for Phoebe
And I for Ganymede
And I for Rosalind
And I for no woman
It is to be all made of fantasy All made of passion and all made of wishes All adoration duty and observance All humbleness all patience and impatience All purity all trial all observance And so am I for Phoebe
And so am I for Rosalind
And so am I for no woman
If this be so why blame you me to love you
If this be so why blame you me to love you
If this be so why blame you me to love you
Why do you speak too “Why blame you me to love you”
To her that is not here nor doth not hear
Pray you no more of this
Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon
I’ll not fail if I live
Nor I
Nor I
Tomorrow is the joyful day Audrey
Tomorrow will we be married
I do desire it with all my heart and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world
Here comes two of the banished duke’s pages
Well met honest gentleman
By my troth well met
Come sit sit and a song
We are for you
Sit i' th' middle
Shall we clap into ’t roundly without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse which are the only prologues to a bad voice
I' faith i' faith and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse
Truly young gentlemen though there was no great matter in the ditty yet the note was very untunable
Dost thou believe Orlando that the boy Can do all this that he hath promisèd
That would I had I kingdoms to give with her
That would I were I of all kingdoms king
That will I should I die the hour after
But if you do refuse to marry me You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd
So is the bargain
Though to have her and death were both one thing
I have promised to make all this matter even
Keep your word Phoebe that you’ll marry me Or else refusing me to wed this shepherd
Keep your word Silvius that you’ll marry her If she refuse me
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor
My lord the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter
But my good lord this boy is forest born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscurèd in the circle of this forest
Good my lord bid him welcome
This is the motley minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest
He hath been a courtier he swears
If any man doubt that let him put me to my purgation
I have undone three tailors
I have had four quarrels and like to have fought one
And how was that ta'en up
Faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause
How “seventh cause” Good my lord like this fellow
I like him very well
Prithee who is ’t that thou mean’st
One that old Frederick your father loves
My father’s love is enough to honor him
Enough
Speak no more of him you’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly
With his mouth full of news
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young
Then shall we be news crammed
All the better
We shall be the more marketable Bonjour Monsieur Le Beau
What’s the news
Fair princess you have lost much good sport
Sport
Of what color
God 'ild you sir
A poor virgin sir an ill favored thing sir but mine own
By my faith he is very swift and sententious
But for the seventh cause
How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause
Upon a lie seven times removed Bear your body more seeming Audrey As thus sir I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard
He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was
This is called “the countercheck quarrelsome” and so to “the lie circumstantial” and “the lie direct”And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut
He’s as good at anything and yet a fool
He uses his folly like a stalking horse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things made even Atone together
Good duke receive thy daughter
Hymen from heaven brought her Yea brought her hither That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is
If there be truth in sight you are my daughter
If there be truth in sight you are my Rosalind
If sight and shape be true Why then my love adieu
Peace ho
O my dear niece welcome thou art to me Even daughter welcome in no less degree
Let me have audience for a word or two
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland That bring these tidings to this fair assembly
Duke Frederick hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest Addressed a mighty power which were on foot In his own conduct purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword
This to be true I do engage my life
Sir by your patience if I heard you rightly The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court
He hath
To him will I
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned
Stay Jaques stay
To see no pastime I
What you would have I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave
Proceed proceed
We’ll so begin these rites As we do trust they’ll end in true delights
If it be true that good wine needs no bush ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue
What color madam
How shall I answer you
As wit and fortune will
You tell us the manner of the wrestling
Well the beginning that is dead and buried
There comes an old man and his three sons  I could match this beginning with an old tale
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
With bills on their necks “Be it known unto all men by these presents”The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the duke’s wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him
So he served the second and so the third
Yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping
Alas
But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost
Why this that I speak of
Or I I promise thee
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides
Shall we see this wrestling cousin
Yonder sure they are coming
Let us now stay and see it
Come on
Since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness
Is yonder the man
Even he madam
Alas he is too young
Yet he looks successfully
How now daughter and cousin
Are you crept hither to see the wrestling
Ay my liege so please you give us leave
You will take little delight in it I can tell you there is such odds in the man
In pity of the challenger’s youth I would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated
Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau
Yonder comes my master your brother
Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up
Monsieur the challenger the Princess calls for you
I attend them with all respect and duty
Young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler
No fair princess
He is the general challenger
I come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth
Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years
You have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength
If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise
We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt
Do young sir
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one shamed that was never gracious if killed but one dead that was willing to be so
I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing
Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty
The little strength that I have I would it were with you
And mine to eke out hers
Fare you well
Pray heaven I be deceived in you
Your heart’s desires be with you
You shall try but one fall
No I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first
I would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg
O excellent young man
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should down
No more no more
How dost thou Charles
He cannot speak my lord
Bear him away
What is thy name young man
Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys
I would thou hadst been son to some man else
The world esteemed thy father honorable But I did find him still mine enemy
I would thou hadst told me of another father
Were I my father coz would I do this
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son His youngest son and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul And all the world was of my father’s mind
Had I before known this young man his son I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured
Gentle cousin Let us go thank him and encourage him
Shall we go coz
Ay Fare you well fair gentleman
He calls us back
Will you go coz
Have with you
Fare you well
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
I cannot speak to her yet she urged conference
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee
Good sir I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place
Albeit you have deserved High commendation true applause and love Yet such is now the duke’s condition That he misconsters all that you have done
The duke is humorous
But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father’s sake And on my life his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth
Sir fare you well
Hereafter in a better world than this I shall desire more love and knowledge of you
I rest much bounden to you
Fare you well
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
But heavenly Rosalind
Why Rosalind
Not one to throw at a dog
No thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs
Throw some of them at me
Then there were two cousins laid up when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any
But is all this for your father
No some of it is for my child’s father
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them
Hem them away
I would try if I could cry “hem” and have him
Come come wrestle with thy affections
Oh they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
Oh a good wish upon you
The duke my father loved his father dearly
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly
By this kind of chase I should hate him for my father hated his father dearly
Yet I hate not Orlando
No faith hate him not for my sake
Why should I not
Doth he not deserve well
Let me love him for that and do you love him because I do
Look here comes the duke
With his eyes full of anger
Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste And get you from our court
Me uncle
You cousin
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles Thou diest for it
I do beseech your Grace Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires If that I do not dream or be not frantic  As I do trust I am not then dear uncle Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness
Thus do all traitors
If their purgation did consist in words They are as innocent as grace itself
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not
Thou art thy father’s daughter
There’s enough
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom
So was I when your Highness banished him
My father was no traitor
Then good my liege mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous
Dear sovereign hear me speak
Ay Celia we stayed her for your sake
I was too young that time to value her But now I know her
If she be a traitor Why so am I
Thou art a fool
She robs thee of thy name And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone
Then open not thy lips
Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her
She is banished
Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
I cannot live out of her company
You are a fool You niece provide yourself
If you outstay the time upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word you die
O my poor Rosalind whither wilt thou go
Wilt thou change fathers
I will give thee mine
I charge thee be not thou more grieved than I am
I have more cause
Now sir what make you here
Nothing
I am not taught to make anything
What mar you then sir
Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them
Know you where you are sir
O sir very well here in your orchard
Know you before whom sir
Ay better than him I am before knows me
I know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me
I have as much of my father in me as you albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence
Thou hast not cousin
Prithee be cheerful
Know’st thou not the duke Hath banished me his daughter
That he hath not
No hath not
Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one
Shall we be sundered
Shall we part sweet girl
For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale Say what thou canst I’ll go along with thee
Why whither shall we go
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden
Alas what danger will it be to us Maids as we are to travel forth so far
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face
Were it not better Because that I am more than common tall That I did suit me all points like a man
A gallant curtal axe upon my thigh A boar spear in my hand and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside  As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances
What shall I call thee when thou art a man
I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page And therefore look you call me Ganymede
But what will you be called
Would he not be a comfort to our travel
Leave me alone to woo him
Let’s away And get our jewels and our wealth together Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight
Now go we in content To liberty and not to banishment
Now my co mates and brothers in exile Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court
These are counselors That feelingly persuade me what I am” Sweet are the uses of adversity Which like the toad ugly and venomous Wears yet a precious jewel in his head
And this our life exempt from public haunt Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks Sermons in stones and good in everything
I would not change it
Happy is your Grace That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style
Come shall we go and kill us venison
And indeed my lord The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase
And did you leave him in this contemplation
We did my lord weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer
Show me the place
I love to cope him in these sullen fits For then he’s full of matter
I’ll bring you to him straight
Can it be possible that no man saw them
It cannot be
Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this
I cannot hear of any that did see her
The ladies her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress
My lord the roinish clown at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing
Send to his brother
Fetch that gallant hither
If he be absent bring his brother to me
I’ll make him find him
Do this suddenly And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways
Who’s there
Why what make you here
Why are you virtuous
Why do people love you
And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you
Know you not master to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies
Oh what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it
Why what’s the matter
Within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives
Your brother no no brother yet the son  Yet not the son I will not call him son  Of him I was about to call his father Hath heard your praises and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie And you within it
If he fail of that He will have other means to cut you off
I overheard him and his practices
This is no place this house is but a butchery
Abhor it fear it do not enter it
Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go
No matter whither so you come not here
What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road
Yet this I will not do do how I can
I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother
But do not so
Let me be your servant
Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter Frosty but kindly
Let me go with you
I’ll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities
O good old man how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world When service sweat for duty not for meed
But come thy ways
We’ll go along together And ere we have thy youthful wages spent We’ll light upon some settled low content
Master go on and I will follow thee To the last gasp with truth and loyalty
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here livèd I but now live here no more
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek But at fourscore it is too late a week
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well and not my master’s debtor
O Jupiter how weary are my spirits
I care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary
I cannot go no further
For my part I had rather bear with you than bear you
Ay now am I in Arden the more fool I
Ay be so good Touchstone
Look you who comes here a young man and an old in solemn talk
Wilt thou lay hands on me villain
I am no villain
Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so
Thou hast railed on thyself
Sweet masters be patient
For your father’s remembrance be at accord
Let me go I say
I will not till I please
You shall hear me
My father charged you in his will to give me good education
You have trained me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities
The spirit of my father grows strong in me and I will no longer endure it
And what wilt thou do beg when that is spent
Well sir get you in
I will not long be troubled with you
You shall have some part of your will
I pray you leave me
That is the way to make her scorn you still
O Corin that thou knew’st how I do love her
I partly guess for I have loved ere now
No Corin being old thou canst not guess Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow
But if thy love were ever like to mine  As sure I think did never man love so  How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
Into a thousand that I have forgotten
Oh thou didst then ne'er love so heartily
If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into Thou hast not loved
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress’s praise Thou hast not loved
Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly as my passion now makes me Thou hast not loved
O Phoebe Phoebe Phoebe
Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound I have by hard adventure found mine own
And I mine
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a  night to Jane Smile
And I remember the kissing of her batler and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom I took two cods and giving her them again said with weeping tears “Wear these for my sake” We that are true lovers run into strange capers
But as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly
Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of
Nay I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it
Jove Jove this shepherd’s passion Is much upon my fashion
And mine but it grows something stale with me
I pray you one of you question yond man if he for gold will give us any food
Peace fool
He’s not thy kinsman
Who calls
Your betters sir
I prithee shepherd if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
Fair sir I pity her And wish for her sake more than for mine own My fortunes were more able to relieve her
But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now By reason of his absence there is nothing That you will feed on
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile That little cares for buying anything
I pray thee if it stand with honesty Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock And thou shalt have to pay for it of us
And we will mend thy wages
Assuredly the thing is to be sold
Go with me
If you like upon report The soil the profit and this kind of life I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly
More more I prithee more
It will make you melancholy Monsieur Jaques
I thank it
More I prithee more
I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs
More I prithee more
My voice is ragged
I know I cannot please you
Come more another stanzo
Nay I care not for their names
Well then if ever I thank any man I’ll thank you
But that they call “compliment” is like th' encounter of two dog  apes
Well I’ll end the song Sirs cover the while the duke will drink under this tree He hath been all this day to look you
And I have been all this day to avoid him
He is too disputable for my company
I think of as many matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them
Come warble come
I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention
Dear master I can go no further
Oh I die for food
Here lie I down and measure out my grave
Farewell kind master
Why how now Adam
No greater heart in thee
Live a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers
I will here be with thee presently and if I bring thee not something to eat I will give thee leave to die
But if thou diest before I come thou art a mocker of my labor
Well said
Thou look’st cheerly and I’ll be with thee quickly
Yet thou liest in the bleak air
Cheerly good Adam
I think he be transformed into a beast For I can nowhere find him like a man
My lord he is but even now gone hence
Here was he merry hearing of a song
If he compact of jars grow musical We shall have shortly discord in the spheres
Go seek him
Tell him I would speak with him
He saves my labor by his own approach
Why how now monsieur
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company
What you look merrily
And then he drew a dial from his poke And looking on it with lackluster eye Says very wisely “It is ten o'clock
Thus we may see” quoth he “how the world wags
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine And after one hour more ’twill be eleven
O noble fool
A worthy fool
Motley’s the only wear
What fool is this
Oh that I were a fool
God be with my old master
He would not have spoke such a word
Is it even so
Begin you to grow upon me
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither Holla Dennis
Calls your Worship
Was not Charles the duke’s wrestler here to speak with me
So please you he is here at the door and importunes access to you
Call him in
Twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is
I must have liberty Withal as large a charter as the wind To blow on whom I please for so fools have
And they that are most gallèd with my folly They most must laugh
And why sir must they so
The “why” is plain as way to parish church He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly although he smart Not to seem senseless of the bob
Invest me in my motley
Give me leave To speak my mind and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world If they will patiently receive my medicine
Fie on thee
I can tell what thou wouldst do
What for a counter would I do but good
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin For thou thyself hast been a libertine As sensual as the brutish sting itself And all th' embossèd sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
Who can come in and say that I mean her When such a one as she such is her neighbor
Forbear and eat no more
Why I have eat none yet
Nor shalt not till necessity be served
Of what kind should this cock come of
Art thou thus boldened man by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners That in civility thou seem’st so empty
You touched my vein at first
But forbear I say
An you will not be answered with reason I must die
What would you have
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness
I almost die for food and let me have it
Sit down and feed and welcome to our table
Speak you so gently
Pardon me I pray you
I thought that all things had been savage here And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment
True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church And sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered
Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn And give it food
There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limped in pure love
I thank you and be blessed for your good comfort
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
All the world’s a stage And all the men and women merely players
They have their exits and their entrances And one man in his time plays many parts His acts being seven ages
At first the infant Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms
Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face creeping like snail Unwillingly to school
And then the justice In fair round belly with good capon lined With eyes severe and beard of formal cut Full of wise saws and modern instances And so he plays his part
Welcome
Set down your venerable burden And let him feed
I thank you most for him
Welcome
Fall to
I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes  Give us some music and good cousin sing
As if time were in debt
How fondly dost thou reason
Bear it straight And bring thy master home immediately
There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me As if I were their well acquainted friend And every one doth call me by my name
Some tender money to me some invite me Some other give me thanks for kindnesses Some offer me commodities to buy
Even now a tailor called me in his shop And showed me silks that he had bought for me And therewithal took measure of my body
Sure these are but imaginary wiles And lapland sorcerers inhabit here
Master here’s The gold you sent me for
What Adam dost thou mean
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam that keeps the prison he that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the Prodigal he that came behind you sir like an evil angel and bid you forsake your liberty
I understand thee not
No
What thou meanest an officer
Ay sir the sergeant of the band he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band one that thinks a man always going to bed and says “God give you good rest”Well sir there rest in your foolery
Is there any ships put forth tonight
May we be gone
Why sir I brought you word an hour since that the barkThe fellow is distract and so am I And here we wander in illusions
Some blessed power deliver us from hence
Well met well met Master Antipholus
I see sir you have found the goldsmith now
Is that the chain you promised me today
Satan avoid
I charge thee tempt me not
Master is this Mistress Satan
It is the devil
Nay she is worse she is the devil’s dam and here she comes in the habit of a light wench
Light is an effect of fire and fire will burn ergo light wenches will burn
Your man and you are marvelous merry sir
Will you go with me
We’ll mend our dinner here
Master if you do expect spoon meat or bespeak a long spoon
Why Dromio
I pray you sir my ring or else the chain
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so
Avaunt thou witch Come Dromio let us go
Mistress that you know
Now out of doubt Antipholus is mad Else would he never so demean himself
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats And for the same he promised me a chain
Both one and other he denies me now
The reason that I gather he is mad Besides this present instance of his rage Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance
Belike his wife acquainted with his fits On purpose shut the doors against his way
My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that being lunatic He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away
This course I fittest choose For forty ducats is too much to lose
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia And coasting homeward came to Ephesus Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbors men
But though thou art adjudgèd to the death And passèd sentence may not be recalled But to our honour’s great disparagement Yet will I favor thee in what I can
Therefore merchant I’ll limit thee this day To seek thy life by beneficial help
I will my lord
Fear me not man
I tell you ’twill sound harshly in her ears
Here comes my man
I think he brings the money
How now sir
Have you that I sent you for
Here’s that I warrant you will pay them all
But where’s the money
Why sir I gave the money for the rope
I’ll serve you sir five hundred at the rate
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home
To a rope’s end sir and to that end am I returned
And to that end sir I will welcome you
Good sir be patient
Good now hold thy tongue
Nay rather persuade him to hold his hands
I would I were senseless sir that I might not feel your blows
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows and so is an ass
I am an ass indeed you may prove it by my long ears I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows
Nay I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat and I think when he hath lamed me I shall beg with it from door to door
Come go along
My wife is coming yonder
MistressWilt thou still talk
How say you now
Is not your husband mad
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven
Peace doting wizard peace
I am not mad
O that thou wert not poor distressèd soul
You minion you are these your customers
Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house
Dined at home”
Thou villain what sayest thou
Sir sooth to say you did not dine at home
Were not my doors locked up and I shut out
Perdie your doors were locked and you shut out
And did not she herself revile me there
Sans fable she herself reviled you there
Did not her kitchen maid rail taunt and scorn me
And did not I in rage depart from thence
In verity you did My bones bear witness That since have felt the vigour of his rage
It is no shame
Alas I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here who came in haste for it
Money by me
Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats
He came to me and I delivered it
And I am witness with her that she did
God and the rope maker bear me witness That I was sent for nothing but a rope
Mistress both man and master is possessed
I know it by their pale and deadly looks
They must be bound and laid in some dark room
I did not gentle husband lock thee forth
And gentle master I received no gold
But I confess sir that we were locked out
Let him not come near me
More company
The fiend is strong within him
What will you murder me Thou jailer thou I am thy prisoner
Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue
Masters let him go
He is my prisoner and you shall not have him
Go bind this man for he is frantic too
He is my prisoner
If I let him go The debt he owes will be required of me
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor And knowing how the debt grows I will pay it  Good Master Doctor see him safe conveyed Home to my house
O most unhappy day
O most unhappy strumpet
Master I am here entered in bond for you
How idly do they talk
One Angelo a goldsmith
Do you know him
I know the man
Two hundred ducats
Say how grows it due
Due for a chain your husband had of him
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not
I long to know the truth hereof at large
God for Thy mercy they are loose again
And come with naked swords
Let’s call more help To have them bound again
Away
They’ll kill us
I see these witches are afraid of swords
She that would be your wife now ran from you
I long that we were safe and sound aboard
Faith stay here this night
They will surely do us no harm
You saw they speak us fair give us gold
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that but for the mountain of mad flesh
that claims marriage of me i could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch
I will not stay tonight for all the town
Therefore away to get our stuff aboard
How is the man esteemed here in the city
His word might bear my wealth at any time
Speak softly
Tis so and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have
Good sir draw near to me
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate
There is your money that I had to keep
Go bear it to the Centaur where we host And stay there Dromio till I come to thee
Within this hour it will be dinnertime
Till that I’ll view the manners of the town Peruse the traders gaze upon the buildings And then return and sleep within mine inn For with long travel I am stiff and weary
Get thee away
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed having so good a mean
A trusty villain sir that very oft When I am dull with care and melancholy Lightens my humor with his merry jests
What will you walk with me about the town And then go to my inn and dine with me
I think I had
I never did deny it
Yes that you did sir and forswore it too
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it
These ears of mine thou know’st did hear thee
Fie on thee wretch
Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus
I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand
I dare and do defy thee for a villain
Run master run
For God’s sake take a house
This is some priory
In or we are spoiled
Be quiet people
Wherefore throng you hither
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence
Let us come in that we may bind him fast And bear him home for his recovery
How long hath this possession held the man
This week he hath been heavy sour sad And much different from the man he was
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage
Hath not else his eye Stray’d his affection in unlawful love A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
Which of these sorrows is he subject to
You should for that have reprehended him
Why so I did
Ay but not rough enough
Haply in private
And in assemblies too
Ay but not enough
Alone it was the subject of my theme In company I often glancèd it
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad
And thereof came it that the man was mad
The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth
Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls
In food in sport and life preserving rest To be disturbed would mad or man or beast
The consequence is then thy jealous fits Have scared thy husband from the use of wits
Good people enter and lay hold on him
Then let your servants bring my husband forth
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath A charitable duty of my order
Therefore depart and leave him here with me
Be quiet and depart
Thou shalt not have him
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity
Come go
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess
By this I think the dial points at five
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town Beheaded publicly for his offense
See where they come
We will behold his death
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey
Yet once again proclaim it publicly If any friend will pay the sum for him He shall not die so much we tender him
Justice most sacred duke against the Abbess
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
Therefore most gracious duke with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
Long since thy husband served me in my wars And I to thee engaged a prince’s word When thou didst make him master of thy bed To do him all the grace and good I could
Peace fool
Thy master and his man are here And that is false thou dost report to us
Mistress upon my life I tell you true
I have not breathed almost since I did see it
He cries for you and vows if he can take you To scorch your face and to disfigure you
Ay me it is my husband
Witness you That he is borne about invisible
Even now we housed him in the abbey here And now he’s there past thought of human reason
Even for the blood That then I lost for thee now grant me justice
Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me
This day great duke she shut the doors upon me While she with harlots feasted in my house
A grievous fault Say woman didst thou so
No my good lord
Myself he and my sister Today did dine together
So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal
Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth
O perjured woman
My liege I am advisèd what I say Neither disturbed with the effect of wine Nor heady rash provoked with raging ire Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
That goldsmith there were he not packed with her Could witness it for he was with me then Who parted with me to go fetch a chain Promising to bring it to the Porpentine Where Balthasar and I did dine together
Our dinner done and he not coming thither I went to seek him
In the street I met him And in his company that gentleman
By th' way we met My wife her sister and a rabble more Of vile confederates
Along with them They brought one Pinch a hungry lean faced villain A mere anatomy a mountebank A threadbare juggler and a fortune teller A needy hollow eyed sharp looking wretch A living dead man
This pernicious slave Forsooth took on him as a conjurer And gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
But had he such a chain of thee or no
He had my lord and when he ran in here These people saw the chain about his neck
I never saw the chain so help me heaven And this is false you burden me withal
Why what an intricate impeach is this
Soon at five o'clock Please you I’ll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime
My present business calls me from you now
Farewell till then
I will go lose myself And wander up and down to view the city
Sir I commend you to your own content
He that commends me to mine own content Commends me to the thing I cannot get
I to the world am like a drop of water That in the ocean seeks another drop Who falling there to find his fellow forth Unseen inquisitive confounds himself
So I to find a mother and a brother In quest of them unhappy lose myself
How chance thou art returned so soon
Returned so soon
Rather approach’d too late
The capon burns the pig falls from the spit The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell My mistress made it one upon my cheek
You say he dined at home the goldsmith here Denies that saying
Sir he dined with her there at the Porpentine
He did and from my finger snatched that ring
Tis true my liege this ring I had of her
Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here
As sure my liege as I do see your Grace
I think you are all mated or stark mad
Most mighty duke vouchsafe me speak a word
Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me
Within this hour I was his bondman sir But he I thank him gnawed in two my cords
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound
I am sure you both of you remember me
You are not Pinch’s patient are you sir
Why look you strange on me
you know me well
I never saw you in my life till now
O grief hath changed me since you saw me last And careful hours with time’s deformèd hand Have written strange defeatures in my face
But tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
Neither
Dromio nor thou
No trust me sir nor I I am sure thou dost
Not know my voice
O time’s extremity Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares
Though now this grainèd face of mine be hid In sap consuming winter’s drizzled snow And all the conduits of my blood froze up Yet hath my night of life some memory My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left My dull deaf ears a little use to hear
All these old witnesses I cannot err  Tell me thou art my son Antipholus
I never saw my father in my life
But seven years since in Syracusa boy Thou know’st we parted
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote
Most mighty duke behold a man much wronged
I see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me
I sir am Dromio
Command him away
I sir am Dromio
Please let me stay
O my old master Who hath bound him here
Whoever bound him I will loose his bonds And gain a husband by his liberty  Speak old Egeon if thou be’st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia That bore thee at a burden two fair sons
O if thou be’st the same Egeon speak And speak unto the same Emilia
Why here begins his morning story right These two Antipholuses these two so like And these two Dromios one in semblance  Besides her urging of her wreck at sea  These are the parents to these children Which accidentally are met together
If I dream not thou art Emilia
If thou art she tell me where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft
Corinth first
Stay stand apart
I know not which is which
I came from Corinth my most gracious lord
And I with him
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior Duke Menaphon your most renownèd uncle
Which of you two did dine with me today
I gentle mistress
And are not you my husband
That is the chain sir which you had of me
I think it be sir
I deny it not
And you sir for this chain arrested me
I think I did sir
I deny it not
I sent you money sir to be your bail By Dromio but I think he brought it not
No none by me
This purse of ducats I received from you And Dromio my man did bring them me
These ducats pawn I for my father here
It shall not need
Thy father hath his life
Sir I must have that diamond from you
There take it and much thanks for my good cheer
Renownèd duke vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathizèd one day’s error Have suffered wrong
Go keep us company And we shall make full satisfaction  Thirty three years have I but gone in travail Of you my sons and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er deliverèd  The Duke my husband and my children both And you the calendars of their nativity Go to a gossips' feast and go with me
After so long grief such nativity
With all my heart I’ll gossip at this feast
Dromio what stuff of mine hast thou embarked
Your goods that lay at host sir in the Centaur
He speaks to me I am your master Dromio
There is a fat friend at your master’s house That kitchened me for you today at dinner
She now shall be my sister not my wife
Methinks you are my glass and not my brother I see by you I am a sweet faced youth
Will you walk in to see their gossiping
Not I sir
You are my elder
That’s a question
How shall we try it
We’ll draw cuts for the signior
Till then lead thou first
Nay then thus We came into the world like brother and brother And now let’s go hand in hand not one before another
Stop in your wind sir
Tell me this I pray Where have you left the money that I gave you
O sixpence that I had o' Wednesday last To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper
The saddler had it sir I kept it not
I am not in a sportive humor now
Tell me and dally not where is the money
We being strangers here how dar’st thou trust So great a charge from thine own custody
I pray you jest sir as you sit at dinner
Methinks your maw like mine should be your clock And strike you home without a messenger
Come Dromio come these jests are out of season
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee
To me sir
Why you gave no gold to me
Come on sir knave have done your foolishness And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart Home to your house the Phoenix sir to dinner
My mistress and her sister stays for you
Now as I am a Christian answer me In what safe place you have bestowed my money Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours That stands on tricks when I am undisposed
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me
Thy mistress' marks
what mistress slave hast thou
What wilt thou flout me thus unto my face Being forbid
There take you that sir knave
What mean you sir
For God’s sake hold your hands
Nay an you will not sir I’ll take my heels
Upon my life by some device or other The villain is o'erraught of all my money
They say this town is full of cozenage As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye Dark working sorcerers that change the mind Soul killing witches that deform the body Disguised cheaters prating mountebanks And many suchlike liberties of sin
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master
Sure Luciana it is two o'clock
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner
Good sister let us dine and never fret
A man is master of his liberty Time is their master and when they see time They’ll go or come
If so be patient sister
Why should their liberty than ours be more
Because their business still lies out o' door
Why headstrong liberty is lashed with woe
Then let your will attend on their accords
This servitude makes you to keep unwed
Not this but troubles of the marriage bed
But were you wedded you would bear some sway
Ere I learn love I’ll practice to obey
How if your husband start some otherwhere
Till he come home again I would forbear
Patience unmoved
No marvel though she pause They can be meek that have no other cause
A wretched soul bruised with adversity We bid be quiet when we hear it cry But were we burdened with like weight of pain As much or more we should ourselves complain
So thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee With urging helpless patience would relieve me But if thou live to see like right bereft This fool begged patience in thee will be left
Well I will marry one day but to try
Say is your tardy master now at hand
Know’st thou his mind
But say I prithee is he coming home
It seems he hath great care to please his wife
Why mistress sure my master is horn mad
Horn mad thou villain
I mean not cuckold mad But sure he is stark mad
My mistress sir” quoth I
Hang up thy mistress
Quoth my master
I know” quoth he “no house no wife no mistress” So that my errand due unto my tongue I thank him I bare home upon my shoulders For in conclusion he did beat me there
Go back again thou slave and fetch him home
Go back again and be new beaten home
For God’s sake send some other messenger
Back slave or I will break thy pate across
Hence prating peasant
Fetch thy master home
You spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
If I last in this service you must case me in leather
Fie how impatience loureth in your face
His company must do his minions grace Whilst I at home starve for a merry look
Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took From my poor cheek
Barren my wit
My decayèd fair A sunny look of his would soon repair
But too unruly deer he breaks the pale And feeds from home
Poor I am but his stale
Self harming jealousy fie beat it hence
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere Or else what lets it but he would be here
Sister you know he promised me a chain
Would that alone o' love he would detain So he would keep fair quarter with his bed
I see the jewel best enamelèd Will lose his beauty
Yet the gold bides still That others touch and often touching will Wear gold yet no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye I’ll weep what’s left away and weeping die
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy
Proceed Solinus to procure my fall And by the doom of death end woes and all
For since the mortal and intestine jars 'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves To admit no traffic to our adverse towns
Nay more if any born at Ephesus Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs Again if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus he dies His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose Unless a thousand marks be levièd To quit the penalty and to ransom him
Thy substance valued at the highest rate Cannot amount unto a hundred marks Therefore by law thou art condemned to die
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur and the heedful slave Is wandered forth in care to seek me out
By computation and mine host’s report I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart
See here he comes
How now sir
is your merry humor altered
You know no Centaur
You received no gold
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
My house was at the Phoenix
Wast thou mad That thus so madly thou didst answer me
What answer sir
When spake I such a word
I did not see you since you sent me hence Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me
Villain thou didst deny the gold’s receipt And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner For which I hope thou felt’st I was displeased
I am glad to see you in this merry vein
What means this jest
I pray you master tell me
Yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
Think’st thou I jest
Hold take thou that and that
Hold sir for God’s sake
Now your jest is earnest
Upon what bargain do you give it me
Because that I familiarly sometimes Do use you for my fool and chat with you Your sauciness will jest upon my love And make a common of my serious hours
Sconce” call you it
Shall I tell you why
Well sir I thank you
Marry sir for this something that you gave me for nothing
I’ll make you amends next to give you nothing for something
But say sir is it dinnertime
In good time sir what’s that
Basting
Well sir then ’twill be dry
If it be sir I pray you eat none of it
Your reason
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting
Well sir learn to jest in good time
There’s a time for all things
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric
By what rule sir
Marry sir by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself
Let’s hear it
There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature
Why is Time such a niggard of hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement
Why but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit
Why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit
For what reason
For two and sound ones too
Nay not sound I pray you
Sure ones then
Nay not sure in a thing falsing
Certain ones then
Name them
The one to save the money that he spends in tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things
Thus I mend it Time himself is bald and therefore to the world’s end will have bald followers
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear That never object pleasing in thine eye That never touch well welcome to thy hand That never meat sweet savored in thy taste Unless I spake or looked or touched or carved to thee
How comes it now my husband O how comes it That thou art thus estranged from thyself
Ah do not tear away thyself from me
I know you not
When were you wont to use my sister thus
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner
By Dromio
By thee and this thou didst return from him That he did buffet thee and in his blows Denied my house for his me for his wife
Did you converse sir with this gentlewoman
What is the course and drift of your compact
I sir
I never saw her till this time
Villain thou liest for even her very words Didst thou deliver to me on the mart
I never spake with her in all my life
What was I married to her in my dream
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss
Until I know this sure uncertainty I’ll entertain the offered fallacy
Dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner
O for my beads
I cross me for a sinner
This is the fairy land
O spite of spites
We talk with goblins owls and sprites If we obey them not this will ensue They’ll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue
Why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not
Dromio thou Dromio thou snail thou slug thou sot
I am transformèd master am I not
I think thou art in mind and so am I Nay master both in mind and in my shape
Tis true
I am an ass else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me
Come come no longer will I be a fool To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn
Come sir to dinner Dromio keep the gate
Husband I’ll dine above with you today And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
Am I in earth in heaven or in hell
Known unto these and to myself disguised
Master shall I be porter at the gate
Ay and let none enter lest I break your pate
Well Syracusian say in brief the cause Why thou dep artedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus
In Syracusa was I born and wed Unto a woman happy but for me And by me had not our hap been bad
That very hour and in the selfsame inn A meaner woman was deliverèd Of such a burden male twins both alike
Unwilling I agreed
Alas too soon We came aboard
Good Signior Angelo you must excuse us all My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours
Say that I lingered with you at your shop To see the making of her carcanet And that tomorrow you will bring it home
But here’s a villain that would face me down He met me on the mart and that I beat him And charged him with a thousand marks in gold And that I did deny my wife and house  Thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this
Say what you will sir but I know what I know
I think thou art an ass
You’re sad Signior Balthasar
I hold your dainties cheap sir and your welcome dear
Good meat sir is common that every churl affords
And welcome more common for that’s nothing but words
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast
Ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest
But though my cates be mean take them in good part
Better cheer may you have but not with better heart
But soft
My door is lock’d
Maud Bridget Marian Ciceley Gillian Ginn
My master stays in the street
Who talks within there
Ho open the door
Wherefore
For my dinner
I have not dined today
What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe
O villain thou hast stolen both mine office and my name
O Lord I must laugh
Have at you with a proverb shall I set in my staff
Do you hear you minion
You’ll let us in I hope
So come help
Well struck
There was blow for blow
Thou baggage let me in
Master knock the door hard
You’ll cry for this minion if I beat the door down
Are you there wife
You might have come before
If you went in pain master this knave would go sore
In debating which was best we shall part with neither
You would say so master if your garments were thin
Your cake there is warm within you stand here in the cold
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold
Go fetch me something I’ll break ope the gate
Here’s too much “out upon thee” I pray thee let me in
Well I’ll break in
Go borrow me a crow
A crow without feather
Master mean you so
For a fish without a fin there’s a fowl without a feather  Go get thee gone
Fetch me an iron crow
Have patience sir
O let it not be so
And doubt not sir but she will well excuse Why at this time the doors are made against you
Be ruled by me depart in patience And let us to the Tiger all to dinner And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint
You have prevailed
I will depart in quiet And in despite of mirth mean to be merry
I know a wench of excellent discourse Pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle
There will we dine
That chain will I bestow  Be it for nothing but to spite my wife  Upon mine hostess there
I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence
Do so
This jest shall cost me some expense
Shall Antipholus Even in the spring of love thy love springs rot
If you did wed my sister for her wealth Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness
What simple thief brags of his own attaint
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board
Though others have the arm show us the sleeve We in your motion turn and you may move us
Then gentle brother get you in again
Sweet mistress what your name is else I know not Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine 
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth’s wonder more than earth divine
Teach me dear creature how to think and speak
Against my soul’s pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field
Are you a god
would you create me new
Transform me then and to your power I’ll yield
But if that I am I then well I know Your weeping sister is no wife of mine Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
Far more far more to you do I decline
O train me not sweet mermaid with thy note To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears
What are you mad that you do reason so
It is a fault that springeth from your eye
For gazing on your beams fair sun being by
Why call you me “love”
Call my sister so
Thy sister’s sister
That’s my sister
No It is thyself mine own self’s better part Mine eye’s clear eye my dear heart’s dearer heart My food my fortune and my sweet hope’s aim My sole earth’s heaven and my heaven’s claim
All this my sister is or else should be
Call thyself “sister” sweet for I am thee
Give me thy hand
O soft sir
Hold you still
I’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill
Why how now Dromio
Where runn’st thou so fast
Do you know me sir
Am I Dromio
Am I your man
Am I myself
The children thus disposed my wife and I Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed Fastened ourselves at either end the mast And floating straight obedient to the stream Was carried towards Corinth as we thought
But ere they came–O let me say no more
Thou art Dromio thou art my man thou art thyself
I am an ass I am a woman’s man and besides myself
What woman’s man
And how besides thyself
What claim lays she to thee
What is she
Marry sir she’s the kitchen wench and all grease and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light
I warrant her rags and the
If she lives till doomsday she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world
What complexion is she of
Swart like my shoe but her face nothing like so clean kept
That’s a fault that water will mend
No sir ’tis in grain Noah’s flood could not do it
What’s her name
Then she bears some breadth
She is spherical like a globe
In what part of her body stands Ireland
Marry sir in her buttocks
Faith I saw it not but I felt it hot in her breath
Where America the Indies
O sir upon her nose all o'er embellished with rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain who sent whole armadas of caracks to be ballast at her nose
And I think if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel She had transformed me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' th' wheel
An if the wind blow any way from shore I will not harbor in this town tonight
If any bark put forth come to the mart Where I will walk till thou return to me
If every one knows us and we know none 'Tis time I think to trudge pack and be gone
As from a bear a man would run for life So fly I from her that would be my wife
There’s none but witches do inhabit here And therefore ’tis high time that I were hence
She that doth call me husband even my soul Doth for a wife abhor
But lest myself be guilty to self wrong I’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song
I know it well sir
Lo here’s the chain
What is your will that I shall do with this
I have made it for you
Made it for me sir
I bespoke it not
Not once nor twice but twenty times you have
You are a merry man sir
Fare you well
What I should think of this I cannot tell But this I think there’s no man is so vain That would refuse so fair an offered chain
I’ll to the mart and there for Dromio stay
If any ship put out then straight away
Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house I will discharge my bond and thank you too
Saving your merry humor here’s the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion Which doth amount to three odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman
I pray you see him presently discharged For he is bound to sea and stays but for it
I am not furnished with the present money
Besides I have some business in the town
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself
Well sir I will
Have you the chain about you
Nay come I pray you sir give me the chain
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman And I to blame have held him here too long
Good Lord
You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine
I should have chid you for not bringing it But like a shrew you first begin to brawl
The hour steals on
I pray you sir dispatch
You hear how he importunes me
The chain
Why give it to my wife and fetch your money
Come come
You know I gave it you even now
Either send the chain or send me by some token
Fie now you run this humor out of breath
Come where’s the chain
I pray you let me see it
I answer you
What should I answer you
The money that you owe me for the chain
I owe you none till I receive the chain
You know I gave it you half an hour since
You wrong me more sir in denying it
Consider how it stands upon my credit
Well officer arrest him at my suit
I doThis touches me in reputation
Consent to pay thee that I never had  Arrest me foolish fellow if thou dar’st
Here is thy fee
Arrest him officer
I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently
I do arrest you sir
You hear the suit
I do obey thee till I give thee bail
But sirrah you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer
Sir sir I will have law in Ephesus To your notorious shame I doubt it not
Nay forward old man
Do not break off so For we may pity though not pardon thee
O had the gods done so I had not now Worthily termed them merciless to us
Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss That by misfortunes was my life prolonged To tell sad stories of my own mishaps
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now
Our fraughtage sir I have conveyed aboard and I have bought The oil the balsamum and aqua vitae
Why thou peevish sheep What ship of Epidamnum stays for me
A ship you sent me to to hire waftage
Thou drunken slave I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end
You sent me for a rope’s end as soon
You sent me to the bay sir for a bark
I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed
To Adriana villain hie thee straight
Give her this key and tell her in the desk That’s cover’d o'er with Turkish tapestry There is a purse of ducats
Let her send it
Tell her I am arrested in the street And that shall bail me
Hie thee slave
Begone  On officer to prison till it come
To Adriana
That is where we dined Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband
She is too big I hope for me to compass
Thither I must although against my will For servants must their masters' minds fulfill
Ah Luciana did he tempt thee so
Looked he or red or pale or sad or merrily
First he denied you had in him no right
He meant he did me none the more my spite
Then swore he that he was a stranger here
Then pleaded I for you
And what said he
That love i begged for you he begged of me
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love
Have patience I beseech
Who would be jealous then of such a one
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone
Ah but I think him better than I say And yet would herein others' eyes were worse
My heart prays for him though my tongue do curse
How hast thou lost thy breath
By running fast
Where is thy master Dromio
Is he well
No he’s in Tartar limbo worse than hell
The passages of alleys creeks and narrow lands A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell
Why man what is the matter
Tell me at whose suit
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well But he’s in a suit of buff which ’rested him that can I tell
Go fetch it sister
This I wonder at That he unknown to me should be in debt
Do you not hear it ring
What the chain
No no the bell
Tis time that I were gone
It was two ere I left him and now the clock strikes one
That did I never hear
Excellent well
You are a fishmonger
Not I my lord
Then I would you were so honest a man
Honest my lord
Ay sir
To be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand
That’s very true my lord
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion  Have you a daughter
I have my lord
Let her not walk i' th' sun
Conception is a blessing but as your daughter may conceive Friend look to ’t
Words words words
What is the matter my lord
Between who
I mean the matter that you read my lord
Slanders sir
Into my grave
Indeed that is out of the air
You cannot sir take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life
Fare you well my lord
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet
There he is
God save you sir
My honored lord
My most dear lord
My excellent good friends
How dost thou Guildenstern
Ah Rosencrantz
Good lads how do you both
Happy in that we are not overhappy
On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button
Then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favors
Faith her privates we
What news
But your news is not true
Let me question more in particular
What have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither
Prison my lord
Denmark’s a prison
Then is the world one
A goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons Denmark being one o' th' worst
We think not so my lord
Why then ’tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
To me it is a prison
Why then your ambition makes it one
Tis too narrow for your mind
Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
A dream itself is but a shadow
Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow
Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows
Shall we to th' court
Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny
Is it your own inclining
What should we say my lord
You were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color
I know the good king and queen have sent for you
To what end my lord
That you must teach me
My lord we were sent for
What might be toward that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day
Who is ’t that can inform me
That can I
I will tell you why
Why did you laugh then when I said “man delights not me”
He that plays the king shall be welcome
The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for ’t
What players are they
Even those you were wont to take delight in the tragedians of the city
How chances it they travel
Their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city
Are they so followed
No indeed are they not
How comes it
Do they grow rusty
Nay their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace
But there is sir an eyrie of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t
These are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither
What are they children
Who maintains 'em
How are they escoted
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing
Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like if their means are no better) their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession
Faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy
There was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question
Is ’t possible
Oh there has been much throwing about of brains
Do the boys carry it away
It is not very strange
For my uncle is King of Denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little
Sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out
There are the players
Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore
Your hands come then
Let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which I tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like entertainment than yours
You are welcome
But my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived
In what my dear lord
I am but mad north north west
When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw
Well be with you gentlemen
Hark you Guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer
Happily he’s the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child
My lord I have news to tell you
My lord I have news to tell you
When Roscius was an actor in Rome The actors are come hither my lord
Buzz buzz
Upon my honor  Then came each actor on his ass 
Why     Am I not i' th' right old Jephthah
If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I love passing well
What follows then my lord
Why
You are welcome masters welcome all I am glad to see thee well Welcome good friends O old friend
What speech my good lord
But it was as I received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning
One speech in it I chiefly loved
This is too long
It shall to the barber’s with your beard Prithee say on
The moblèd queen”
That’s good
Moblèd queen” is good
Look whe'e he has not turned his color and has tears in ’s eyes Prithee no more
My lord I will use them according to their desert
God’s bodykins man much better
Use them after your own honor and dignity
The less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
Take them in
Come sirs
Follow him friends
We’ll hear a play tomorrow
Ay my lord
We’ll ha ’t tomorrow night
You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in ’t could you not
Ay my lord
Very well
Follow that lord and look you mock him not
My good friends I’ll leave you till night
You are welcome to Elsinore
Good my lord
Now I am alone
Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I
And all for nothing  For Hecuba
And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands So by his father lost
In the most high and palmy state of Rome A little ere the mightiest Julius fell The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood Disasters in the sun and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
But soft behold
Lo where it comes again
I’ll cross it though it blast me Stay illusion
If thou hast any sound or use of voice Speak to me
Am I a coward
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
Tweaks me by the nose
Who does me this
Bloody bawdy villain
Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
O vengeance
Why what an ass am I
Fie upon ’t foh
For murder though it have no tongue will speak With most miraculous organ
If he do blench I know my course
I’ll have grounds More relative than this
The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy
Did he receive you well
Most like a gentleman
Niggard of question but of our demands Most free in his reply
Madam it so fell out that certain players We o'erraught on the way
They are about the court And as I think they have already order This night to play before him
Tis most true And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter
With all my heart and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined
Good gentlemen give him a further edge And drive his purpose on to these delights
We shall my lord
I shall obey you
Madam I wish it may
Ophelia walk you here
Let’s withdraw my lord
To die to sleep  No more and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to ’tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished
To die to sleep
There’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time Th' oppressor’s wrong the proud man’s contumely The pangs of despised love the law’s delay The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin
Who would fardels bear To grunt and sweat under a weary life But that the dread of something after death The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of
Good my lord How does your honor for this many a day
I humbly thank you
Well well well
My lord I have remembrances of yours That I have longèd long to redeliver
I pray you now receive them
There my lord
Ha ha are you honest
My lord
Are you fair
What means your lordship
That if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty
Could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty
Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness
This was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof
I did love you once
Indeed my lord you made me believe so
I loved you not
I was the more deceived
Get thee to a nunnery
I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven
We are arrant knaves all
Believe none of us
Go thy ways to a nunnery
Where’s your father
At home my lord
Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool no where but in ’s own house
Farewell
O help him you sweet heavens
Get thee to a nunnery go
Farewell
Farewell
Heavenly powers restore him
I have heard of your paintings too well enough
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another
You jig and amble and you lisp you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance
Go to I’ll no more on ’t
It hath made me mad
I say we will have no more marriages
Those that are married already all but one shall live
The rest shall keep as they are
To a nunnery go
Love
His affections do not that way tend
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something settled matter in his heart Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself
What think you on ’t
It shall do well
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
Let her be round with him And I’ll be placed so please you in the ear Of all their conference
If she find him not To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think
It shall be so
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me Speak to me
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth For which they say you spirits oft walk in death Speak of it
Stay and speak
Stop it Marcellus
Shall I strike at it with my partisan
Do if it will not stand
Tis here
Tis here
Tis gone
It was about to speak when the cock crew
Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue
Oh it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant
Pray you avoid it
I warrant your honor
Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us sir
O reform it altogether
And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered
And the queen too and that presently
Bid the players make haste
Will you two help to hasten them
Ay my lord
What ho Horatio
Here sweet lord at your service
Horatio thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal
O my dear lord    Nay do not think I flatter
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits To feed and clothe thee
Why should the poor be flattered
No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning
Dost thou hear
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish her election Hath sealed thee for herself for thou hast been  As one in suffering all that suffers nothing  A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks
Give him heedful note
They are coming to the play
I must be idle
Get you a place
How fares our cousin Hamlet
Excellent i' faith of the chameleon’s dish
I eat the air promise crammed
You cannot feed capons so
I have nothing with this answer Hamlet
These words are not mine
No nor mine now
That did I my lord and was accounted a good actor
What did you enact
I did enact Julius Caesar
I was killed i' th' Capitol
Brutus killed me
Ay my lord
They stay upon your patience
No good mother
Here’s metal more attractive
Lady shall I lie in your lap
No my lord
I mean my head upon your lap
Ay my lord
Do you think I meant country matters
What is my lord
Nothing
You are merry my lord
Who I
Ay my lord
O God your only jig maker
What should a man do but be merry
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within these two hours
Nay ’tis twice two months my lord
So long
Nay then let the devil wear black for I’ll have a suit of sables
Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year
But by 'r Lady he must build churches then or else shall he suffer not thinking on with the hobby horse whose epitaph is “For oh for oh the hobby horse is forgot”What means this my lord
Marry this is miching
Belike this show imports the argument of the play
We shall know by this fellow
The players cannot keep counsel
They’ll tell all
Will he tell us what this show meant
Ay or any show that you will show him
Be not you ashamed to show he’ll not shame to tell you what it means
You are naught you are naught
I’ll mark the play
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
Tis brief my lord
As woman’s love
Madam how like you this play
The lady protests too much methinks
Oh but she’ll keep her word
Is there no offense in ’t
No offense i' th' world
What do you call the play
It faded on the crowing of the cock
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it As needful in our loves fitting our duty
I could interpret between you and your love if I could see the puppets dallying
Come “The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge ”
The story is extant and writ in choice Italian
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife
The king rises
What frighted with false fire
How fares my lord
Give me some light away
Lights lights lights
A whole one I
Didst perceive
Very well my lord
Upon the talk of the poisoning
I did very well note him
Ah ha
Come some music
Come the recorders
Come some music
Good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you
Sir a whole history
The king sir  Ay sir what of him
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered
I am tame sir
Pronounce
The queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you
You are welcome
Nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer I will do your mother’s commandment
If not your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business
Sir I cannot
What my lord
Make you a wholesome answer
My wit’s diseased
Therefore no more but to the matter
O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration
Impart
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed
We shall obey were she ten times our mother
Have you any further trade with us
My lord you once did love me
And do still by these pickers and stealers
Good my lord what is your cause of distemper
Sir I lack advancement
How can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark
I do not well understand that
Will you play upon this pipe
My lord I cannot
I pray you
Believe me I cannot
I do beseech you
I know no touch of it my lord
It is as easy as lying
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony
You would seem to know my stops
Sblood do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe
Call me what instrument you will though you can fret me yet you cannot play upon me
God bless you sir
My lord the queen would speak with you and presently
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel
By th' mass and ’tis like a camel indeed
Methinks it is like a weasel
It is backed like a weasel
Or like a whale
Very like a whale
Then I will come to my mother by and by
I will say so
Tis now the very witching time of night When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on
I will speak daggers to her but use none
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
I like him not nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range
Therefore prepare you
I your commission will forthwith dispatch And he to England shall along with you
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies
We will ourselves provide
The cease of majesty Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw What’s near it with it
It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined which when it falls Each small annexment petty consequence Attends the boisterous ruin
Never alone Did the king sigh but with a general groan
Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage
For we will fetters put upon this fear Which now goes too free footed
We will haste us
My lord he’s going to his mother’s closet
Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process
I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home
And as you said (and wisely was it said) 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother  Since nature makes them partial should o'erhear The speech of vantage
Fare you well my liege
I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know
Thanks dear my lord
It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t A brother’s murder
So much for him
That cannot be since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder My crown mine own ambition and my queen
May one be pardoned and retain th' offense
In the corrupted currents of this world Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law
But ’tis not so above
What can it not
Yet what can it when one can not repent
O bosom black as death
O limèd soul that struggling to be free Art more engaged
Help angels
Make assay
Now might I do it pat
Now he is a praying
And now I’ll do ’t
And so he goes to heaven
And so am I revenged That would be scanned
And am I then revenged
No
Words without thoughts never to heaven go
He will come straight
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
Speak to her Hamlet
To whom do you speak this
Avoid what is to come
O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
Good night but go not to mine uncle’s bed
Assume a virtue if you have it not
So again good night
I must be cruel only to be kind
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind
Twere good you let him know For who that’s but a queen fair sober wise Would from a paddock from a bat a gib Such dear concernings hide
Let it work For ’tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard
You must translate
Tis fit we understand them
Ah my good lord what have I seen tonight
How does Hamlet
O heavy deed
Alas how shall this bloody deed be answered
But like the owner of a foul disease To keep it from divulging let it feed Even on the pith of life
Where is he gone
Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body Into the chapel
Safely stowed
What have you done my lord with the dead body
Tell us where ’tis that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel
Believe what
But such officers do the king best service in the end
I am glad of it
Yet must not we put the strong law on him
Without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
Bring him before us
Not where he eats but where he is eaten
That’s the end
What dost you mean by this
Therefore prepare thyself
The bark is ready and the wind at help Th' associates tend and everything is bent For England
Farewell dear mother
Thy loving father Hamlet
My mother
Do it England For like the hectic in my blood he rages And thou must cure me
I will do ’t my lord
Go softly on
They are of Norway sir
What says Polonius
Take thy fair hour Laertes
Thou know’st ’tis common
Ay madam it is common
God be wi' you sir
Go a little before
What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed
A beast no more
I will not speak with her
What would she have
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark
Nay but Ophelia  Pray you mark
How do you pretty lady
God be at your table
Conceit upon her father
How long hath she been thus
We must be patient but I cannot choose but weep to think they should lay him i' th' cold ground
Oh this is the poison of deep grief
Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts
Alack what noise is this
I pray you give me leave
Do not fear our person
Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
I dare damnation
Who shall stay you
My will not all the world
And for my means I’ll husband them so well They shall go far with little
Will you know them then
How now
What noise is that
Tears seven times salt Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
By heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight Till our scale turn the beam
You must singThis nothing’s more than matter
There’s rosemary that’s for remembrance
Nay it is
Do you see this O God
Laertes I must commune with your grief Or you deny me right
Let this be so
So you shall
Seafaring men sir
Let them come in
Let him bless thee too
Fare well
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal And you must put me in your heart for friend Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life
It well appears
Letters my lord from Hamlet
Sailors my lord they say
I saw them not
He received them Of him that brought them
How otherwise  Will you be ruled by me
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation
Why ask you this
And nothing is at a like goodness still
But good Laertes Will you do this keep close within your chamber
I will do ’t
Therefore this project
Be as ourself in Denmark Madam come
Come away
One woe doth tread upon another’s heel So fast they follow Your sister’s drowned Laertes
Alas then she is drowned
But yet It is our trick
Let’s follow Gertrude
How much I had to do to calm his rage
Now fear I this will give it start again
Therefore let’s follow
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation
The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial
How can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defense
It must beNay but hear you Goodman Delver  Give me leave
But is this law
Ay marry is ’t
Crowner’s quest law
Come my spade
Why he had none
Marry now I can tell
Has this fellow no feeling of his business
He sings at grave  making
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
It might my lord
Ay my lord
Mine ache to think on ’t
Not a jot more my lord
I will speak to this fellow Whose grave’s this sirrah
You lie out on ’t sir and therefore it is not yours
Tis for the dead not for the quick
Therefore thou liest
What man dost thou dig it for
What woman then
The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe How long hast thou been a grave maker
Of all the days i' the year I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras
Ay marry why was he sent into England
Why because he was mad
Why
Twill not be seen in him there
How came he mad
How “strangely”
Faith e'en with losing his wits
Why he more than another
Let me see
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth Must I remember
Why she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on and yet within a month  Let me not think on ’t
Within a month Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her gallèd eyes She married
It is not nor it cannot come to good But break my heart for I must hold my tongue
Hail to your lordship
I am glad to see you well  Horatio
Or I do forget myself
Sir my good friend I’ll change that name with you
My good lord
What’s that my lord
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' th' earth
E'en so
And smelt so
Pah
E'en so my lord
To what base uses we may return Horatio
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole
Twere to consider too curiously to consider so
No faith not a jot
Imperious Caesar dead and turned to clay Might stop a hole to keep the wind away
Oh that that earth which kept the world in awe Should patch a wall t' expel the winter’s flaw
But soft but soft a while
Here comes the king The queen the courtiers who is this they follow And with such maimèd rites
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life
Couch we a while and mark
What ceremony else
For charitable prayers Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants Her maiden strewments and the bringing home Of bell and burial
Must there no more be done
No more be done
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace parted souls
Lay her i' th' earth And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring
I tell thee churlish priest A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling
Sweets to the sweet
Farewell
Oh treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of
Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms
Hold off thy hand
Pluck them asunder
O my son what theme
I loved Ophelia
Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum
What wilt thou do for her
O he is mad Laertes
For love of God forbear him
Swounds show me what thou'lt do
Woo’t weep
Woo’t fight
Woo’t fast
Woo’t tear thyself
I’ll do ’t
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us till our ground Singeing his pate against the burning zone Make Ossa like a wart
This is mere madness
And thus a while the fit will work on him
Anon as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed His silence will sit drooping
I loved you ever
But it is no matter
I pray thee good Horatio wait upon him
Who’s there
Long live the king
Barnardo
He
You come most carefully upon your hour
Tis now struck twelve
Get thee to bed Francisco
For this relief much thanks
Tis bitter cold And I am sick at heart
Have you had quiet guard
Not a mouse stirring
Well good night
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus The rivals of my watch bid them make haste
I think I hear them Stand ho
So much for this sir
Now shall you see the other
You do remember all the circumstance
Remember it my lord
Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes
Is ’t possible
I beseech you
Wilt thou know Th' effect of what I wrote
Ay good my lord
I had my father’s signet in my purse Which was the model of that Danish seal
Folded the writ up in form of th' other Subscribed it gave ’t th' impression placed it safely The changeling never known
Now the next day Was our sea fight and what to this was sequent Thou know’st already
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t
Why man they did make love to this employment
They are not near my conscience
Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensèd points Of mighty opposites
Why what a king is this
is ’t not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm
And is ’t not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there
It will be short
The interim’s mine
I’ll court his favors
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion
Peace Who comes here
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark
I humbly thank you sir
Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I should impart a thing to you from His Majesty
I thank your lordship
It is very hot
It is indifferent cold my lord indeed
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion
Exceedingly my lord
It is very sultry as ’twere I cannot tell how
My lord his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head
Sir this is the matter I beseech you remember  Nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith
Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th' arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail
A truant disposition good my lord
I would not hear your enemy say so Nor shall you do mine ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself
I know you are no truant
But what is your affair in Elsinore
We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart
My lord I came to see your father’s funeral
I pray thee do not mock me fellow student
I think it was to see my mother’s wedding
Indeed my lord it followed hard upon
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day Horatio
My father methinks I see my father
Where my lord
In my mind’s eye Horatio
I saw him once
He was a goodly king
He was a man
Take him for all in all
I shall not look upon his like again
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
The concernancy sir
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath
Sir
I know you are not ignorant  I would you did sir
Yet in faith if you did it would not much approve me
Well sir
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is 
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself
I mean sir for his weapon
Rapier and dagger
That’s two of his weapons
But well
The king sir hath wagered with him six Barbary horses against the which he has impawned as I take it six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and so
Three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of very liberal conceit
What call you the carriages
The carriages sir are the hangers
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides
I would it might be hangers till then
But on six Barbary horses against six French swords their assigns and three liberal conceited carriages that’s the French bet against the Danish
Why is this “impawned” as you call it
The king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits
How if I answer “No”
If it please His Majesty ’tis the breathing time of day with me
I commend my duty to your lordship
Yours yours
He does well to commend it himself
There are no tongues else for ’s turn
He did comply sir with his dug before he sucked it
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time
I am constant to my purpose
They follow the king’s pleasure
If his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided I be so able as now
The king and queen and all are coming down
In happy time
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play
She well instructs me
You will lose this wager my lord
I do not think so
Since he went into France I have been in continual practice
I shall win at the odds
But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart
But it is no matter
I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit
Not a whit
We defy augury
If it be not to come it will be now
Since no man of aught he leaves knows what is ’t to leave betimes
Let be
Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me
But in my terms of honor I stand aloof and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honor I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored
Come one for me
I’ll be your foil Laertes
You mock me sir
No by this hand
Very well my lord
Your grace hath laid the odds o' th' weaker side
I have seen you both
But since he is better we have therefore odds
Ay my good lord
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table
If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange Let all the battlements their ordnance fire
The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn
Give me the cups
Come on sir
Come my lord
One
No
Judgment
A hit a very palpable hit
Well again
Stay give me drink Hamlet this pearl is thine
Here’s to thy health
Give him the cup
Set it by a while
Come
Another hit
What say you
A touch a touch I do confess ’t
Our son shall win
He’s fat and scant of breath  Here Hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
The queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet
Good madam
Gertrude do not drink
I will my lord
I pray you pardon me
I dare not drink yet madam
By and by
Come let me wipe thy face
I do not think ’t
Come for the third Laertes
You do but dally
I pray you pass with your best violence
I am afeard you make a wanton of me
Say you so
Come on
Have at you now
Part them
They are incensed
Nay come again
Look to the queen there ho
They bleed on both sides How is it my lord
How is ’t Laertes
Why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric
How does the queen
She swoons to see them bleed
The drink the drink
I am poisoned
O villainy
Ho let the door be locked
Treachery
Seek it out
It is here Hamlet
Hamlet thou art slain
No medicine in the world can do thee good
In thee there is not half an hour of life
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand Unbated and envenomed
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me
Lo here I lie Never to rise again
Thy mother’s poisoned
I can no more
The king the king’s to blame
The point envenomed too Then venom to thy work
My lord I think I saw him yesternight
Saw who
The king my father
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you
For God’s love let me hear
Two nights together had these gentlemen Marcellus and Barnardo on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night Been thus encountered a figure like your father Armed at point exactly cap à pie Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them
Thrice he walked By their oppressed and fear surprisèd eyes Within his truncheon’s length whilst they distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear Stand dumb and speak not to him
I knew your father
But where was this
Treason
Treason
O yet defend me friends
I am but hurt
Here thou incestuous murderous damnèd Dane Drink off this potion
Is thy union here
Follow my mother
He is justly served
It is a poison tempered by himself
Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet
Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee Nor thine on me
Heaven make thee free of it
Thou livest
Never believe it
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane
Here’s yet some liquor left
As thou'rt a man Give me the cup
Let go
By heaven I’ll have ’t
O God Horatio what a wounded name Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity a while And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story
What warlike noise is this
Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland To th' ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley
O I die Horatio
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit
I cannot live to hear the news from England
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras
He has my dying voice
O O O O
Where is this sight
What is it ye would see
This quarry cries on havoc
O proud death What feast is toward in thine eternal cell That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck
The sight is dismal And our affairs from England come too late
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing To tell him his commandment is fulfilled That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
Had it th' ability of life to thank you
For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage For he was likely had he been put on To have proved most royally
And for his passage The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him
Take up the bodies
My lord upon the platform where we watch
Did you not speak to it
My lord I did But answer made it none
Tis very strange
As I do live my honored lord ’tis true
And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it
Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
Hold you the watch tonight
We do my lord
Armed say you
Armed my lord
From top to toe
My lord from head to foot
Then saw you not his face
Oh yes my lord
He wore his beaver up
Pale or red
Nay very pale
And fixed his eyes upon you
Most constantly
I would I had been there
Stayed it long
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
Longer longer
Not when I saw ’t
His beard was grizzled no
It was as I have seen it in his life A sable silvered
I will watch tonight
Perchance 'Twill walk again
I warrant it will
If it assume my noble father’s person I’ll speak to it though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace
I pray you all If you have hitherto concealed this sight Let it be tenable in your silence still
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight Give it an understanding but no tongue
I will requite your loves
So fare you well
Upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve I’ll visit you
Our duty to your honor
Your loves as mine to you
Farewell
My father’s spirit in arms
All is not well
I doubt some foul play
Would the night were come
Till then sit still my soul
Foul deeds will rise Though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men’s eyes
My necessaries are embarked
Farewell
And sister as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant do not sleep But let me hear from you
Do you doubt that
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood A violet in the youth of primy nature Forward not permanent sweet not lasting The perfume and suppliance of a minute
No more
No more but so
Think it no more
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity
Fear it Ophelia
Fear it my dear sister And keep you in the rear of your affection Out of the shot and danger of desire
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent
Be wary then
Best safety lies in fear
Youth to itself rebels though none else near
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart
O fear me not
I stay too long
But here my father comes
Yet here Laertes
Aboard aboard for shame
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for
There my blessing with thee
And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character
Give thy thoughts no tongue Nor any unproportioned thought his act
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel but being in Bear ’t that th' opposèd may beware of thee
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice
Take each man’s censure but reserve thy judgment
Farewell
Your servants tend
Tis in my memory locked And you yourself shall keep the key of it
Farewell
What is ’t Ophelia he hath said to you
So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet
If it be so as so ’tis put on me  And that in way of caution I must tell you You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor
What is between you
Give me up the truth
He hath my lord of late made many tenders Of his affection to me
Affection
Pooh you speak like a green girl Unsifted in such perilous circumstance
Do you believe his “tenders” as you call them
I do not know my lord what I should think
Marry I’ll teach you
Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay Which are not sterling
Tender yourself more dearly Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase Running it thus you’ll tender me a fool
Go to go to
And hath given countenance to his speech my lord With almost all the holy vows of heaven
Ay springes to catch woodcocks
I do know When the blood burns how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows
For Lord Hamlet Believe so much in him that he is young And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you
Look to ’t I charge you
Come your ways
I shall obey my lord
Friends to this ground
And liegemen to the Dane
Give you good night
O farewell honest soldier
Who hath relieved you
Barnardo has my place
Give you good night
Say what is Horatio there
A piece of him
What has this thing appeared again tonight
I have seen nothing
Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it
It is a nipping and an eager air
What hour now
I think it lacks of twelve
No it is struck
Indeed
I heard it not
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
What does this mean my lord
Is it a custom
Ay marry is ’t
But to my mind though I am native here And to the manner born it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance
This heavy headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition
And indeed it takes From our achievements though performed at height The pith and marrow of our attribute
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal
Look my lord it comes
Angels and ministers of grace defend us
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell Be thy intents wicked or charitable Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee
I’ll call thee “Hamlet” “King” “Father” “royal Dane” O answer me
Let me not burst in ignorance but tell Why thy canonized bones hearsed in death Have burst their cerements why the sepulcher
Wherein we saw thee quietly interred Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again
Wherefore
It beckons you to go away with it As if it some impartment did desire To you alone
Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removèd ground
But do not go with it
No by no means
Do not my lord
Why what should be the fear
I do not set my life in a pin’s fee And for my soul what can it do to that Being a thing immortal as itself
It waves me forth again
I’ll follow it
And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness
Think of it
It waves me still
You shall not go my lord
Hold off your hands
Be ruled
You shall not go
Still am I called Unhand me gentlemen
By heaven I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me
He waxes desperate with imagination
Let’s follow
Tis not fit thus to obey him
Nay let’s follow him
Where wilt thou lead me
Speak I’ll go no further
Mark me
I will
My hour is almost come When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself
Alas poor ghost
Speak
I am bound to hear
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
What
I am thy father’s spirit Doomed for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confined to fast in fires Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end Like quills upon the fearful porpentine
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood
List list O list
If thou didst ever thy dear father love  O God
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
Murder
Murder most foul as in the best it is
But this most foul strange and unnatural
Haste me to know ’t that I with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love May sweep to my revenge
My uncle
O Hamlet what a falling off was there
From me whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine
Brief let me be
Thus was I sleeping by a brother’s hand Of life of crown of queen at once dispatched Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
Oh horrible oh horrible most horrible
If thou hast nature in thee bear it not
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damnèd incest
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her
Fare thee well at once
The glowworm shows the matin to be near And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire
Adieu adieu adieu
Remember me
O all you host of heaven
O earth
What else
And shall I couple hell
Oh fie
Hold hold my heart And you my sinews grow not instant old But bear me stiffly up
Remember thee
Ay thou poor ghost whiles memory holds a seat In this distracted globe
Remember thee
Yea from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records All saws of books all forms all pressures past That youth and observation copied there And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain Unmixed with baser matter
Yes by heaven
O most pernicious woman
O villain villain smiling damnèd villain
My tables Meet it is I set it down That one may smile and smile and be a villain
At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark
Remember me” I have sworn ’t
My lord my lord
Lord Hamlet  Heaven secure him
So be it
Illo ho ho my lord
Hillo ho ho boy
Come bird come
How is ’t my noble lord
What news my lord
Oh wonderful
Good my lord tell it
Not I my lord by heaven
Nor I my lord
How say you then
But you’ll be secret
Ay by heaven my lord
Sit down a while And let us once again assail your ears That are so fortified against our story What we have two nights seen
Well sit we down And let us hear Barnardo speak of this
Last night of all When yond same star that’s westward from the pole Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven Where now it burns Marcellus and myself The bell then beating one  Peace break thee off
Look where it comes again
In the same figure like the king that’s dead
Most like
It harrows me with fear and wonder
It would be spoke to
Question it Horatio
By heaven I charge thee speak
There’s ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave
There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave To tell us this
Why right you are in the right
And so without more circumstance at all I hold it fit that we shake hands and part
You as your business and desire shall point you  For every man has business and desire Such as it is and for my own poor part Look you I’ll go pray
These are but wild and whirling words my lord
There’s no offense my lord
Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio And much offense too
Touching this vision here It is an honest ghost that let me tell you
For your desire to know what is between us O'ermaster ’t as you may
And now good friends As you are friends scholars and soldiers Give me one poor request
What is ’t my lord
We will
Never make known what you have seen tonight
My lord we will not
Nay but swear ’t
In faith my lord not I
Nor I my lord in faith
Upon my sword
We have sworn my lord already
Indeed upon my sword indeed
Consent to swear
Never to speak of this that you have seen
Swear by my sword
Come hither gentlemen And lay your hands again upon my sword
Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard
Well said old mole
A worthy pioneer
Once more remove good friends
O day and night but this is wondrous strange
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio Than are dreamt of in your philosophy
This not to do So grace and mercy at your most need help you Swear
Nay come let’s go together
Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo
I will my lord
You shall do marvelous wisely good Reynaldo Before you visit him to make inquire Of his behavior
My lord I did intend it
Marry well said very well said
Take you as ’twere some distant knowledge of him As thus “I know his father and his friends And in part him” Do you mark this Reynaldo
Ay very well my lord
And in part him but” you may say “not well
Addicted so and so ” And there put on him What forgeries you please
But sir such wanton wild and usual slips
Ay or drinking fencing swearing Quarreling drabbing you may go so far
My lord that would dishonor him
Faith no as you may season it in the charge
But my good lord  Wherefore should you do this
Ay my lord
I would know that
Very good my lord
And then sir does he this he does  What was I about to say
By the mass I was about to say something
Where did I leave
I saw him yesterday” or “t' other day” Or then or then with such or such “and as you say There was he gaming there o'ertook in’s rouse There falling out at tennis” or perchance “I saw him enter such a house of sale”  Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
You have me have you not
My lord I have
God be wi' you
Fare you well
Good my lord
I shall my lord
And let him ply his music
Well my lord
Farewell
With what i' th' name of God
Mad for thy love
What said he
Long stayed he so
At last a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being
Come go with me
I will go seek the king
This is the very ecstasy of love Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures
I am sorry
That hath made him mad
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him
I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee
But beshrew my jealousy
By heaven it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion
Come go we to the king
Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Moreover that we much did long to see you The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending
Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s “transformation” so call it Since nor th' exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was
What it should be More than his father’s death that thus hath put him So much from th' understanding of himself I cannot dream of
Both your majesties Might by the sovereign power you have of us Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty
But we both obey And here give up ourselves in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded
Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern
Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changèd son
Go some of you And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him
Ay amen
Th' ambassadors from Norway my good lord Are joyfully returned
Thou still hast been the father of good news
Have I my lord
I assure my good liege I hold my duty as I hold my soul Both to my God and to my gracious king
It is offended
See it stalks away
Stay
I charge thee speak
How now Horatio
You tremble and look pale
Is not this something more than fantasy
What think you on ’t
Before my God I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes
Is it not like the king
As thou art to thyself
Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated
So frowned he once when in an angry parle He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice
Tis strange
And I do think or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy
Oh speak of that
That do I long to hear
Give first admittance to th' ambassadors
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast
Thyself do grace to them and bring them in
He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper
I doubt it is no other but the main His father’s death and our o'erhasty marriage
Well we shall sift him Welcome my good friends
Say Voltemand what from our brother Norway
Whereat grieved  That so his sickness age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th' assay of arms against your majesty
Whereon old Norway overcome with joy
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers So levied as before against the Polack With an entreaty herein further shown That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down
Meantime we thank you for your well took labor
Go to your rest
At night we’ll feast together
Most welcome home
This business is well ended
My liege and madam to expostulate What majesty should be what duty is Why day is day night night and time is time Were nothing but to waste night day and time
Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes I will be brief your noble son is mad
Mad call I it for to define true madness What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad
But let that go
Thus it remains and the remainder thus
I have a daughter have while she is mine  Who in her duty and obedience mark Hath given me this
Good madam stay a while
I will be faithful
O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers
I have not art to reckon my groans but that I love thee best oh most best believe it
Adieu
Hamlet” This in obedience hath my daughter shown me And more above hath his solicitings As they fell out by time by means and place All given to mine ear
But how hath she received his love
What do you think of me
As of a man faithful and honorable
I would fain prove so
What might you think
No I went round to work And my young mistress thus I did bespeak “Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star
It may be very like
Hath there been such a time I would fain know that  That I have positively said “'Tis so” When it proved otherwise
Not that I know
How may we try it further
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby
So he does indeed
At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him
Away I do beseech you both away
I’ll board him presently
O give me leave
How does my good Lord Hamlet
Well God 'a' mercy
Do you know me my lord
The town is beseeched and the trumpet call us to the breach and we talk and be Chrish do nothing ’tis shame for us all
So God sa' me ’tis shame to stand still
By the mess ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber ay’ll de gud service or I’ll lig i' th' grund for it ay or go to death
Captain Macmorris I think look you under your correction there is not many of your nation Of my nation
What ish my nation
Ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal
What ish my nation
Who talks of my nation
Look you if you take the matter otherwise than is meant Captain Macmorris peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me look you being as good a man as yourself both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities
I do not know you so good a man as myself
So Chrish save me I will cut off your head
Gentlemen both you will mistake each other
Ah that’s a foul fault
The town sounds a parley
Captain Macmorris when there is more better opportunity to be required look you I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war and there is an end
How yet resolves the governor of the town
This is the latest parle we will admit
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or like to men proud of destruction Defy us to our worst
For as I am a soldier A name that in my thoughts becomes me best If I begin the batt'ry once again I will not leave the half achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie burièd
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up And the fleshed soldier rough and hard of heart In liberty of bloody hand shall range With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants
What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career
We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th' enragèd soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore
What say you
Will you yield and this avoid Or guilty in defense be thus destroyed
Our expectation hath this day an end
The Dauphin whom of succors we entreated Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege
Therefore great King We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy
Open your gates
Come uncle Exeter Go you and enter Harfleur
There remain And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest Tomorrow for the march are we addressed
It must be so for miracles are ceased And therefore we must needs admit the means How things are perfected
Doth his Majesty Incline to it or no
D'elbow”“D'elbow”“De nick”“De nick”“De chin” “De sin”
Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme
An if he be not fought withal my lord Let us not live in France
Let us quit all And give our vineyards to a barbarous people
Normans but bastard Normans Norman bastards
Unfought withal but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm In that nook shotten isle of Albion
Is not their climate foggy raw and dull On whom as in despite the sun looks pale Killing their fruit with frowns
And shall our quick blood spirited with wine Seem frosty
Where is Montjoy the herald
Speed him hence
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance
Up princes and with spirit of honor edged More sharper than your swords hie to the field Charles Delabreth High Constable of France You dukes of Orléans Bourbon and of Berri Alençon Brabant Bar and Burgundy Jacques Chatillon Rambures Vaudemont Beaumont Grandpré Roussi and Faulconbridge Foix Lestrale Bouciqualt and Charolois High dukes great princes barons lords and knights For your great seats now quit you of great shames
Bar Harry England that sweeps through our land With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur
Therefore Lord Constable haste on Montjoy And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give
Prince Dauphin you shall stay with us in Rouen
Not so I do beseech your Majesty
Be patient for you shall remain with us
Now forth Lord Constable and princes all And quickly bring us word of England’s fall
Is the duke of Exeter safe
He is called Aunchient Pistol
I know him not
Here is the man
Captain I thee beseech to do me favors
The duke of Exeter doth love thee well
Ay I praise God and I have merited some love at his hands
Fortune is an excellent moral
A damnèd death
Aunchient Pistol I do partly understand your meaning
Die and be damned andIt is well
Why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal
I’ll assure you he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer’s day
trick up with new tuned oaths and what a beard of the general’s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale washed wits is wonderful to be thought on
But you must learn to know such slanders of the age or else you may be marvelously mistook
If I find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mind
How now Fluellen cam’st thou from the bridge
Ay so please your Majesty
The duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge
The French is gone off look you and there is gallant and most prave passages
Marry th' athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced to retire and the duke of Exeter is master of the pridge
I can tell your Majesty the duke is a prave man
What men have you lost Fluellen
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great reasonable great
Marry for my part I think the duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church one Bardolph if your Majesty know the man
We would have all such offenders so cut off and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner
You know me by my habit
Well then I know thee
What shall I know of thee
My master’s mind
Unfold it
Thus says my king “Say thou to Harry of England though we seemed dead we did but sleep
Advantage is a better soldier than rashness
Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe
Now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial
With good acceptance of his Majesty  Save that there was not time enough to hear As I perceived his Grace would fain have done The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms And generally to the crown and seat of France Derived from Edward his great grandfather
What was th' impediment that broke this off
The French ambassador upon that instant Craved audience
And the hour I think is come To give him hearing
Is it four o'clock
It is
Then go we in to know his embassy Which I could with a ready guess declare Before the Frenchman speak a word of it
Bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to reanswer his pettiness would bow under
For our losses his exchequer is too poor for th' effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction
To this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronounced” So far my king and master so much my office
What is thy name
I know thy quality
Montjoy
Thou dost thy office fairly
Turn thee back And tell thy king I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment for to say the sooth Though ’tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage My people are with sickness much enfeebled My numbers lessened and those few I have Almost no better than so many French Who when they were in health I tell thee herald I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen
Yet forgive me God That I do brag thus
Go therefore tell thy master here I am
I shall deliver so
Thanks to your Highness
I hope they will not come upon us now
We are in God’s hand brother not in theirs
March to the bridge
It now draws toward night
Tut I have the best armor of the world
Would it were day
You have an excellent armor but let my horse have his due
It is the best horse of Europe
Will it never be morning
My lord of Orléans and my Lord High Constable you talk of horse and armor
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world
What a long night is this
I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns
He bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the Pegasus qui a les narines de feu
The earth sings when he touches it
The basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes
He’s of the color of the nutmeg
And of the heat of the ginger
It is a beast for Perseus
He is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts
Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse
It is the prince of palfreys
His neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
No more cousin
Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey
It is a theme as fluent as the sea
Turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all
Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride on and for the world familiar to us and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him
I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus “Wonder of nature ”I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser for my horse is my mistress
Your mistress bears well
So perhaps did yours
Mine was not bridled
Oh then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your straight strossers
You have good judgment in horsemanship
Be warned by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs
I had rather have my horse to my mistress
I had as lief have my mistress a jade
I tell thee Constable my mistress wears his own hair
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress
Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement et la truie lavée au bourbier” Thou mak’st use of anything
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose
My Lord Constable the armor that I saw in your tent tonight are those stars or suns upon it
Stars my lord
Some of them will fall tomorrow I hope
And yet my sky shall not want
That may be for you bear a many superfluously and ’twere more honor some were away
Ev'n as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted
Would I were able to load him with his desert
Will it never be day
I will not say so for fear I should be faced out of my way
Tis midnight
I’ll go arm myself
The Dauphin longs for morning
He longs to eat the English
Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath
He is simply the most active gentleman of France
Doing is activity and he will still be doing
He never did harm that I heard of
Nor will do none tomorrow
He will keep that good name still
I know him to be valiant
I was told that by one that knows him better than you
What’s he
Marry he told me so himself and he said he cared not who knew it
He needs not
It is no hidden virtue in him
Tis a hooded valor and when it appears it will bate
Ill will never said well
Have at the very eye of that proverb with “A pox of the devil”You are the better at proverbs by how much “A fool’s bolt is soon shot”You have shot over
Tis not the first time you were overshot
My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents
Who hath measured the ground
The Lord Grandpré
Alas poor Harry of England
He longs not for the dawning as we do
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of England to mope with his fat brained followers so far out of his knowledge
If the English had any apprehension they would run away
That they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armor they could never wear such heavy head pieces
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures
Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples
You may as well say that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion
Just just and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives
And then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devils
Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight
Now is it time to arm
Come shall we about it
It is now two o'clock
But let me see by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen
Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe
Oh now who will behold The royal captain of this ruined band
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury
Not here in presence
Send for him good uncle
Shall we call in th' ambassador my liege
Not yet my cousin
We would be resolved Before we hear him of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France
God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it
Sure we thank you
My learnèd lord we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim
And God forbid my dear and faithful lord That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate whose right Suits not in native colors with the truth For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation
Let him cry “Praise and glory on his head” For forth he goes and visits all his host Bids them good morrow with a modest smile And calls them brothers friends and countrymen
Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color Unto the weary and all watchèd night But freshly looks and overbears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty That every wretch pining and pale before Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
Gloucester ’tis true that we are in great danger
The greater therefore should our courage be
Good morrow brother Bedford
God almighty There is some soul of goodness in things evil Would men observingly distill it out
For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers Which is both healthful and good husbandry
Besides they are our outward consciences And preachers to us all admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end
Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself
Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham
A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France
So the spirit is eased
And when the mind is quickened out of doubt The organs though defunct and dead before Break up their drowsy grave and newly move With casted slough and fresh legerity
Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas
We shall my liege
Shall I attend your Grace
No my good knight
Go with my brothers to my lords of England
I and my bosom must debate awhile And then I would no other company
The Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry
A friend
Discuss unto me art thou officer or art thou base common and popular
I am a gentleman of a company
Trail’st thou the puissant pike
Even so
What are you
As good a gentleman as the emperor
Then you are a better than the king
The king’s a bawcock and a heart of gold A lad of life an imp of fame Of parents good of fist most valiant
I kiss his dirty shoe and from heartstring I love the lovely bully
What is thy name
Harry le Roy
Le Roy
A Cornish name
Art thou of Cornish crew
No I am a Welshman
Know’st thou Fluellen
Yes
Tell him I’ll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy’s day
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours
Art thou his friend
And his kinsman too
TheI thank you
God be with you
My name is Pistol called
It sorts well with your fierceness
Captain Fluellen
It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept
If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great you shall find I warrant you that there is no tiddle toddle nor pibble babble in Pompey’s camp
I warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise
Why the enemy is loud
You hear him all night
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb in your own conscience now
I will speak lower
I pray you and beseech you that you will
Though it appear a little out of fashion There is much care and valor in this Welshman
Brother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder
We see yonder the beginning of the day but I think we shall never see the end of it Who goes there
A friend
Under what captain serve you
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman
I pray you what thinks he of our estate
Even as men wracked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide
He hath not told his thought to the king
The violet smells to him as it doth to me
His ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing
Therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are
Yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army
He may show what outward courage he will but I believe as cold a night as ’tis he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck and so I would he were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit here
By my troth I will speak my conscience of the king
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men’s minds
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company his cause being just and his quarrel honorable
That’s more than we know
If his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us
But if the cause be not good the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all “We died at such a place” some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left
I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument
The king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services
Besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrament of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers
Now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from God
Where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish
Then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited
Every subject’s duty is the king’s but every subject’s soul is his own
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every mote out of his conscience
And dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained
Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head
The king is not to answer it
I do not desire he should answer for me and yet I determine to fight lustily for him
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed
If I live to see it I will never trust his word after
You pay him then
That’s a perilous shot out of an elder gun that a poor and private displeasure can do against a monarch
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather
You’ll “never trust his word after” Come ’tis a foolish saying
Your reproof is something too round
I should be angry with you if the time were convenient
Let it be a quarrel between us if you live
I embrace it
How shall I know thee again
Give me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my bonnet
Then if ever thou dar’st acknowledge it I will make it my quarrel
There
This will I also wear in my cap
If ever thou come to me and say after tomorrow “This is my glove” by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear
If ever I live to see it I will challenge it
Thou dar’st as well be hanged
Well I will do it though I take thee in the king’s company
Keep thy word
Fare thee well
Indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders
But it is no English treason to cut French crowns and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper
Of what your reverence shall incite us to
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person How you awake our sleeping sword of war
Under this conjuration speak my lord For we will hear note and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism
Then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers That owe yourselves your lives and services To this imperial throne
Upon the king
Let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king
We must bear all
O hard condition Twin born with greatness subject to the breath Of every fool whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing
What infinite heart’s ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy
And what have kings that privates have not too Save ceremony save general ceremony
And what art thou thou idol ceremony
What kind of god art thou that suffer’st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
What are thy comings in
O ceremony show me but thy worth
What is thy soul of adoration
Art thou aught else but place degree and form Creating awe and fear in other men Wherein thou art less happy being feared Than they in fearing
What drink’st thou oft instead of homage sweet But poisoned flattery
Oh be sick great greatness And bid thy ceremony give thee cure
Think’st thou the fiery fever will go out With titles blown from adulation
Will it give place to flexure and low bending
Canst thou when thou command’st the beggar’s knee Command the health of it
No thou proud dream That play’st so subtly with a king’s repose
And but for ceremony such a wretch Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep Had the forehand and vantage of a king
My lord your nobles jealous of your absence Seek through your camp to find you
Good old knight Collect them all together at my tent
I’ll be before thee
I shall do’t my lord
O God of battles steel my soldiers' hearts
Possess them not with fear
Take from them now The sense of reck'ning ere th' opposèd numbers Pluck their hearts from them
Not today O Lord Oh not today think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown
I Richard’s body have interrèd anew And on it have bestowed more contrite tears Than from it issued forcèd drops of blood
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood
And I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard’s soul
More will I do  Though all that I can do is nothing worth Since that my penitence comes after all Imploring pardon
My liege
My brother Gloucester’s voice Ay I know thy errand
I will go with thee
The day my friends and all things stay for me
The sun doth gild our armor
Up my lords
Now my Lord Constable
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh
Ha
What will you have them weep our horses' blood
How shall we then behold their natural tears
The English are embattled you French peers
To horse you gallant princes straight to horse
What’s to say
Then let the trumpets sound The tucket sonance and the note to mount For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall couch down in fear and yield
Why do you stay so long my lords of France
Yond island carrions desperate of their bones Ill favoredly become the morning field
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
They have said their prayers and they stay for death
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits And give their fasting horses provender And after fight with them
On to the field
I will the banner from a trumpet take And use it for my haste
Come come away
The sun is high and we outwear the day
Where is the king
The king himself is rode to view their battle
Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand
There’s five to one
Besides they all are fresh
God’s arm strike with us
Tis a fearful odds
God be wi' you princes all
I’ll to my charge
Farewell good Salisbury and good luck go with thee
Farewell kind lord
Fight valiantly today
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor
He is as full of valor as of kindness Princely in both
Oh that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today
What’s he that wishes so
My cousin Westmoreland
No my fair cousin
If we are marked to die we are enough To do our country loss and if to live The fewer men the greater share of honor
God’s will I pray thee wish not one man more
By Jove I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost It yearns me not if men my garments wear Such outward things dwell not in my desires
But if it be a sin to covet honor I am the most offending soul alive
No faith my coz wish not a man from England
God’s peace I would not lose so great an honor As one man more methinks would share from me For the best hope I have
Oh do not wish one more
His passport shall be made And crowns for convoy put into his purse
We would not die in that man’s company That fears his fellowship to die with us
He that shall see this day and live old age Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors And say “Tomorrow is Saint Crispian” Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars And say “These wounds I had on Crispin’s day”
All things are ready if our minds be so
Perish the man whose mind is backward now
Thou dost not wish more help from England coz
God be with you all
Tucket Once more I come to know of thee King Harry If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound Before thy most assurèd overthrow
For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted
Besides in mercy The constable desires thee thou wilt mind Thy followers of repentance that their souls May make a peaceful and a sweet retire From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies Must lie and fester
Who hath sent thee now
The constable of France
I pray thee bear my former answer back
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
The man that once did sell the lion’s skin While the beast lived was killed with hunting him
A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves upon the which I trust Shall witness live in brass of this day’s work
And those that leave their valiant bones in France Dying like men though buried in your dunghills They shall be famed for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honors reeking up to heaven Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
Besides their writers say King Pepin which deposèd Childeric Did as heir general being descended Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair Make claim and title to the crown of France
Hugh Capet also who usurped the crown Of Charles the duke of Lorraine sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great To find his title with some shows of truth Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught Conveyed himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare Daughter to Charlemagne who was the son To Lewis the Emperor and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great
Also King Lewis the Tenth Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet Could not keep quiet in his conscience Wearing the crown of France till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was reunited to the crown of France
So that as clear as is the summer’s sun King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim King Lewis his satisfaction all appear To hold in right and title of the female
Let me speak proudly tell the constable We are but warriors for the working day Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched With rainy marching in the painful field
There’s not a piece of feather in our host  Good argument I hope we will not fly  And time hath worn us into slovenry
If they do this As if God please they shall my ransom then Will soon be levied
Herald save thou thy labor
Come thou no more for ransom gentle herald
They shall have none I swear but these my joints Which if they have as I will leave 'em them Shall yield them little
Tell the constable
I shall King Harry
And so fare thee well
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore
I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom
My lord most humbly on my knee I beg The leading of the vaward
Take it brave York
Now soldiers march away And how Thou pleasest God dispose the day
Yield cur
He says his name is Master Fer
Master Fer
What are his words
He prays you to save his life
He is a gentleman of a good house and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns
Tell him my fury shall abate and I the crowns will take
Expound unto me boy
He gives you upon his knees a thousand thanks and he esteems himself happy that he hath fall'n into the hands of one as he thinks the most brave valorous and thrice  worthy seigneur of England
As I suck blood I will some mercy show
Follow me
I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart
I must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp
The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it for there is none to guard it but boys
Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes
Do not run away
Why all our ranks are broke
O perdurable shame
Let’s stab ourselves
Be these the wretches that we played at dice for
Is this the king we sent to for his ransom
Shame and eternal shame nothing but shame
Let us die
And he that will not follow Bourbon now Let him go hence and with his cap in hand Like a base pander hold the chamber door Whilst by a slave no gentler than my dog His fairest daughter is contaminate
Disorder that hath spoiled us friend us now
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives
We are enough yet living in the field To smother up the English in our throngs If any order might be thought upon
The devil take order now
I’ll to the throng
Let life be short else shame will be too long
Yet keep the French the field
The duke of York commends him to your Majesty
Lives he good uncle
Thrice within this hour I saw him down thrice up again and fighting
From helmet to the spur all blood he was
In which array brave soldier doth he lie Larding the plain and by his bloody side Yoke fellow to his honor owing wounds The noble earl of Suffolk also lies
Suffolk first died and York all haggled over Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face
And cries aloud “Tarry my cousin Suffolk
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven
Tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast As in this glorious and well foughten field We kept together in our chivalry” Upon these words I came and cheered him up
The French have reinforced their scattered men
Then every soldier kill his prisoners
Give the word through
So do the kings of France unto this day Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurped from you and your progenitors
May I with right and conscience make this claim
The sin upon my head dread sovereign For in the Book of Numbers is it writ “When the man dies let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter” Gracious lord Stand for your own unwind your bloody flag Look back into your mighty ancestors
Go my dread lord to your great grandsire’s tomb From whom you claim
Invoke his warlike spirit And your great uncle’s Edward the Black Prince Who on the French ground played a tragedy Making defeat on the full power of France Whiles his most mighty father on a hill Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp Forage in blood of French nobility
O noble English that could entertain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by All out of work and cold for action
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats
You are their heir you sit upon their throne The blood and courage that renownèd them Runs in your veins and my thrice puissant liege Is in the very May morn of his youth Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
Kill the poys and the luggage
Tis expressly against the law of arms
Tis as arrant a piece of knavery mark you now as can be offert in your conscience now is it not
Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter
Besides they have burned and carried away all that was in the king’s tent wherefore the king most worthily hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat
Oh ’tis a gallant king
Ay he was porn at Monmouth Captain Gower
Why I pray you is not “pig” great
The pig or the great or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous are all one reckonings save the phrase is a little variations
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon
His father was called Philip of Macedon as I take it
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn
I tell you Captain if you look in the maps of the 'orld I warrant you shall find in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth that the situations look you is both alike
There is a river in Macedon and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth
It is called Wye at Monmouth but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river
But ’tis all one ’tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers and there is salmons in both
If you mark Alexander’s life well Harry of Monmouth’s life is come after it indifferent well for there is figures in all things
Alexander God knows and you know in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations and also being a little intoxicates in his prains did in his ales and his angers look you kill his best friend Cleitus
It is not well done mark you now to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished
I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it
Sir John Falstaff
That is he
I’ll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth
Here comes his Majesty
I was not angry since I came to France Until this instant
Take a trumpet herald
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill
If they will fight with us bid them come down Or void the field
They do offend our sight
If they’ll do neither we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforcèd from the old Assyrian slings
Go and tell them so
Here comes the herald of the French my liege
His eyes are humbler than they used to be
Know’st thou not That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom
Com’st thou again for ransom
No great king
I come to thee for charitable license That we may wander o'er this bloody field To book our dead and then to bury them To sort our nobles from our common men For many of our princes woe the while  Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs In blood of princes and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage Yerk out their armèd heels at their dead masters Killing them twice
Oh give us leave great king To view the field in safety and dispose Of their dead bodies
The day is yours
Praised be God and not our strength for it
What is this castle called that stands hard by
They call it Agincourt
Then call we this the field of Agincourt Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus
Your grandfather of famous memory an’t please your Majesty and your great uncle Edward the Plack Prince of Wales as I have read in the chronicles fought a most prave pattle here in France
They did Fluellen
Your Majesty says very true
If your Majesties is remembered of it the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which your Majesty know to this hour is an honorable badge of the service
And I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy’s day
I wear it for a memorable honor For I am Welsh you know good countryman
Thanks good my countryman
By Jeshu I am your Majesty’s countryman I care not who know it
I will confess it to all the 'orld
I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty praised be God so long as your Majesty is an honest man
God keep me so Our heralds go with him
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead On both our parts
Soldier you must come to the king
Soldier why wear’st thou that glove in thy cap
An’t please your Majesty ’tis the gage of one that I should fight withal if he be alive
An Englishman
He is a craven and a villain else an ’t please your Majesty in my conscience
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort quite from the answer of his degree
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself it is necessary look your Grace that he keep his vow and his oath
If he be perjured see you now his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and His earth in my conscience la
Then keep thy vow sirrah when thou meet’st the fellow
So I will my liege as I live
Who serv’st thou under
Under Captain Gower my liege
Gower is a good captain and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars
Call him hither to me soldier
I will my liege
Here Fluellen wear thou this favor for me and stick it in thy cap
Your Grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects
Know’st thou Gower
He is my dear friend an please you
Pray thee go seek him and bring him to my tent
I will fetch him
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester Follow Fluellen closely at the heels
The glove which I have given him for a favor May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear
I by bargain should Wear it myself
Follow and see there be no harm between them
Go you with me uncle of Exeter
I warrant it is to knight you Captain
God’s will and His pleasure Captain I beseech you now come apace to the king
Sir know you this glove
Know the glove
I know the glove is a glove
I know this and thus I challenge it
Sblood an arrant traitor as any ’s in the universal world or in France or in England
Do you think I’ll be forsworn
Stand away Captain Gower
I will give treason his payment into plows I warrant you
I am no traitor
He’s a friend of the Duke Alençon’s
My Lord of Warwick here is praised be God for it a most contagious treason come to light look you as you shall desire in a summer’s day
Here is his Majesty
My liege here is a villain and a traitor that look your Grace has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alençon
My liege this was my glove here is the fellow of it
I met this man with my glove in his cap and I have been as good as my word
Your Majesty hear now saving your Majesty’s manhood what an arrant rascally beggarly lousy knave it is
I hope your Majesty is pear me testimony and witness and will avouchment that this is the glove of Alençon that your Majesty is give me in your conscience now
Twas I indeed thou promised’st to strike And thou hast given me most bitter terms
They know your Grace hath cause and means and might So hath your Highness
Never king of England Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilioned in the fields of France
Oh let their bodies follow my dear liege With blood and sword and fire to win your right In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only But fear the main intendment of the Scot Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us
An please your Majesty let his neck answer for it if there is any martial law in the world
How canst thou make me satisfaction
It was ourself thou didst abuse
Your Majesty came not like yourself
You appeared to me but as a common man
And what your Highness suffered under that shape I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine for had you been as I took you for I made no offense
Therefore I beseech your Highness pardon me
I will none of your money
It is with a good will
I can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes
Come wherefore should you be so pashful
Your shoes is not so good
Tis a good silling I warrant you or I will change it
Now herald are the dead numbered
Here is the number of the slaughtered French
What prisoners of good sort are taken uncle
This note doth tell me of ten thousand French That in the field lie slain
Of princes in this number And nobles bearing banners there lie dead One hundred twenty six
Added to these Of knights esquires and gallant gentlemen Eight thousand and four hundred of the which Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights
So that in these ten thousand they have lost There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries
The rest are princes barons lords knights squires And gentlemen of blood and quality
Of lusty earls Grandpré and Roussi Faulconbridge and Foix Beaumont and Marle Vaudemont and Lestrale
Where is the number of our English dead
When without stratagem But in plain shock and even play of battle Was ever known so great and little loss On one part and on th' other
Take it God For it is none but thine
Tis wonderful
Yes Captain but with this acknowledgement That God fought for us
Yes my conscience He did us great good
Do we all holy rites
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story That I may prompt them and of such as have I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse Of time of numbers and due course of things Which cannot in their huge and proper life Be here presented
So let him land And solemnly see him set on to London
So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruisèd helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city
He forbids it Being free from vainness and self glorious pride Giving full trophy signal and ostent Quite from himself to God
But now behold In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought How London doth pour out her citizens
The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort Like to the senators of th' antique Rome With the plebeians swarming at their heels Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in  As by a lower but loving likelihood
Then brook abridgment and your eyes advance After your thoughts straight back again to France
Saint Davy’s day is past
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things
It was in place where I could not breed no contention with him but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires
Why here he comes swelling like a turkey cock
Ha art thou bedlam
Hence
I am qualmish at the smell of leek
I peseech you heartily scurvy lousy knave at my desires and my requests and my petitions to eat look you this leek
Because look you you do not love it nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it I would desire you to eat it
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats
There is one goat for you
Base Trojan thou shalt die
You say very true scald knave when God’s will is
I will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals
Come there is sauce for it
Enough Captain
You have astonished him
I say I will make him eat some part of my leek or I will peat his pate four days Bite I pray you
It is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb
Must I bite
Yes certainly and out of doubt and out of question too and ambiguities
By this leek I will most horribly revenge
Will you have some more sauce to your leek
There is not enough leek to swear by
Quiet thy cudgel
Thou dost see I eat
Much good do you scald knave heartily
Nay pray you throw none away
The skin is good for your broken coxcomb
When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter I pray you mock at 'em that is all
Good
Ay leeks is good
Hold you there is a groat to heal your pate
Me a groat
If I owe you anything I will pay you in cudgels
You shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels
God be wi' you and keep you and heal your pate
All hell shall stir for this
Go go
You are a counterfeit cowardly knave
Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words
I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice
You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb he could not therefore handle an English cudgel
Fare you well
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now
News have I that my Nell is dead i' th' spital Of a malady of France And there my rendezvous is quite cut off
Old I do wax and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled
Well bawd I’ll turn And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand
To England will I steal and there I’ll steal
And patches will I get unto these cudgeled scars And swear I got them in the Gallia wars
But there’s a saying very old and true “If that you will France win Then with Scotland first begin” For once the eagle England being in prey To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs Playing the mouse in absence of the cat To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat
It follows then the cat must stay at home
Yet that is but a crushed necessity Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
While that the armèd hand doth fight abroad Th' advisèd head defends itself at home
Right joyous are we to behold your face Most worthy brother England
So are you princes English every one
The venom of such looks we fairly hope Have lost their quality and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
To cry “Amen” to that thus we appear
You English princes all I do salute you
My duty to you both on equal love Great kings of France and England
That I have labored With all my wits my pains and strong endeavors To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview Your mightiness on both parts best can witness
Alas she hath from France too long been chased And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps Corrupting in its own fertility
Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart Unprunèd dies
Her hedges even pleached Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair Put forth disordered twigs
Her fallow leas The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery
The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover Wanting the scythe withal uncorrected rank Conceives by idleness and nothing teems But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burrs Losing both beauty and utility
And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges Defective in their natures grow to wildness Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost or do not learn for want of time The sciences that should become our country But grow like savages as soldiers will
That nothing do but meditate on blood To swearing and stern looks diffused attire And everything that seems unnatural
If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace Whose want gives growth to th' imperfections Which you have cited you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands Whose tenors and particular effects You have enscheduled briefly in your hands
The king hath heard them to the which as yet There is no answer made
Well then the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer
I have but with a cursitory eye O'erglanced the articles
Pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more with better heed To resurvey them we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer
And we’ll consign thereto Will you fair sister Go with the princes or stay here with us
Our gracious brother I will go with them
Haply a woman’s voice may do some good When articles too nicely urged be stood on
Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us
She is our capital demand comprised Within the forerank of our articles
She hath good leave
Fair Katherine and most fair Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady’s ear And plead his love suit to her gentle heart
Your Majesty shall mock at me
I cannot speak your England
O fair Katherine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue
Do you like me Kate
An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel
I said so dear Katherine and I must not blush to affirm it
The princess is the better Englishwoman I' faith Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding
I am glad thou canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown
I know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say “I love you” Then if you urge me farther than to say “Do you in faith” I wear out my suit
Give me your answer i' faith do and so clap hands and a bargain
How say you lady
For the one I have neither words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength
If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I should quickly leap into a wife
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook
I speak to thee plain soldier
If thou canst love me for this take me
If not to say to thee that I shall die is true but for thy love by the Lord no
Yet I love thee too
And while thou liv’st dear Kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places
For these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors they do always reason themselves out again
If thou would have such a one take me
And what say’st thou then to my love
Speak my fair and fairly I pray thee
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France
No it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate
But in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it
I will have it all mine
And Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine
I cannot tell wat is dat
No Kate
Can any of your neighbors tell Kate
I’ll ask them
But good Kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because I love thee cruelly
Shall we not
What say’st thou my fair flower de luce
I do not know dat
No ’tis hereafter to know but now to promise
Do but now promise Kate you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor
By mine honor in true English I love thee Kate
By which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage
Now beshrew my father’s ambition
But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear
My comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face
Thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better
And therefore tell me most fair Katherine will you have me
Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say “Harry of England I am thine” which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but I will tell
thee aloud “England is thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Harry Plantagenet is thine” who though I speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows
Come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy English broken
Therefore queen of all Katherine break thy mind to me in broken English
Wilt thou have me
Den it sall also content me
Upon that I kiss your hand and I call you my queen
Then I will kiss your lips Kate
Madam my interpreter what says she
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France I cannot tell wat isTo kiss
YourIt is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married would she say
O Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings
Dear Kate you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion
We are the makers of manners Kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find  faults as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss
Therefore patiently and yielding
God save your Majesty
My royal cousin teach you our princess English
I would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I love her and that is good English
Is she not apt
Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness
I this infer That many things having full reference To one consent may work contrariously As many arrows loosèd several ways Come to one mark as many ways meet in one town As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea As many lines close in the dial’s center So may a thousand actions once afoot End in one purpose and be all well borne Without defeat
Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that
If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind
Can you blame her then being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self
It were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to
They are then excused my lord when they see not what they do
Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer
And so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind too
As love is my lord before it loves
It is so
Shall Kate be my wife
So please you
I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her
So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will
We have consented to all terms of reason
Is ’t so my lords of England
The king hath granted every article His daughter first and in sequel all According to their firm proposed natures
Only he hath not yet subscribèd this Where your Majesty demands that the king of France having any occasion to write for matter of grant shall name your Highness in this form and with this addition in FrenchNor this I have not brother so denied But your request shall make me let it pass
I pray you then in love and dear alliance Let that one article rank with the rest And thereupon give me your daughter
Amen
Now welcome Kate and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen
God the best maker of all marriages Combine your hearts in one your realms in one
God speak this “amen”
Amen
Prepare we for our marriage on which day My Lord of Burgundy we’ll take your oath And all the peers' for surety of our leagues
Then shall I swear to Kate and you to me And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be
Thus far with rough and all unable pen Our bending author hath pursued the story In little room confining mighty men Mangling by starts the full course of their glory
Henry the Sixth in infant bands crowned king Of France and England did this king succeed Whose state so many had the managing That they lost France and made his England bleed Which oft our stage hath shown
And for their sake In your fair minds let this acceptance take
If we with thrice such powers left at home Cannot defend our own doors from the dog Let us be worried and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin for we hear Your greeting is from him not from the king
May ’t please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge Or shall we sparingly show you far off The Dauphin’s meaning and our embassy
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts
Into a thousand parts divide one man And make imaginary puissance
Think when we talk of horses that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings Carry them here and there jumping o'er times
We are no tyrant but a Christian king Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fettered in our prisons
Therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness Tell us the Dauphin’s mind
You cannot revel into dukedoms there
He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit This tun of treasure and in lieu of this Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you
This the Dauphin speaks
What treasure uncle
Tennis balls my liege
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us
His present and your pains we thank you for
When we have matched our rackets to these balls We will in France by God’s grace play a set Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard
And we understand him well How he comes o'er us with our wilder days Not measuring what use we made of them
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore living hence did give ourself To barbarous license as ’tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home
So get you hence in peace
And tell the Dauphin His jest will savor but of shallow wit When thousands weep more than did laugh at it
This was a merry message
We hope to make the sender blush at it
Therefore my lords omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition For we have now no thought in us but France Save those to God that run before our business
Therefore let every man now task his thought That this fair action may on foot be brought
Now all the youth of England are on fire And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
Ere he take ship for France and in Southampton
There is the playhouse now there must you sit And thence to France shall we convey you safe And bring you back charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass for if we may We’ll not offend one stomach with our play
But till the king come forth and not till then Unto Southampton do we shift our scene
Well met Corporal Nym
Good morrow Lieutenant Bardolph
What are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet
For my part I care not
I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends and we’ll be all three sworn brothers to France
Let ’t be so good Corporal Nym
That is my rest that is the rendezvous of it
I cannot tell
Things must be as they may
Men may sleep and they may have their throats about them at that time and some say knives have edges
There must be conclusions
Well I cannot tell
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife
Now by this hand I swear I scorn the term Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers
Oh well a day Lady
Pish
Pish for thee Iceland dog Thou prick eared cur of Iceland
Good Corporal Nym show thy valor and put up your sword
Will you shog off
I am not Barbason you cannot conjure me
I have an humor to knock you indifferently well
If you grow foul with me Pistol I will scour you with my rapier as I may in fair terms
O braggart vile and damnèd furious wight The grave doth gape and doting death is near
Therefore exhale
Hear me hear me what I say he that strikes the first stroke I’ll run him up to the hilts as I am a soldier
An oath of mickle might and fury shall abate
Thy spirits are most tall
By my troth he’ll yield the crow a pudding one of these days
The king has killed his heart
Good husband come home presently
Come shall I make you two friends
Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on
You’ll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting
Base is the slave that pays
That now I will have that’s the humor of it
As manhood shall compound
Push home
By this sword he that makes the first thrust I’ll kill him
By this sword I will
Sword” is an oath and oaths must have their course
Prithee put up
In cash most justly paid
Well then that’s the humor of ’t
As ever you come of women come in quickly to Sir John
Ah poor heart he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold
Sweet men come to him
Turning th' accomplishment of many years Into an hour glass for the which supply Admit me chorus to this history Who prologue like your humble patience pray Gently to hear kindly to judge our play
Nym thou hast spoke the right
He passes some humors and careers
They shall be apprehended by and by
How smooth and even they do bear themselves As if allegiance in their bosoms sat Crownèd with faith and constant loyalty
The king hath note of all that they intend By interception which they dream not of
Now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
My Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham And you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
Think you not that the powers we bear with us Will cut their passage through the force of France Doing the execution and the act For which we have in head assembled them
No doubt my liege if each man do his best
I doubt not that since we are well persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on us
Never was monarch better feared and loved Than is your Majesty
There’s not I think a subject That sits in heart grief and uneasiness Under the sweet shade of your government
True
Those that were your father’s enemies Have steeped their galls in honey and do serve you With hearts create of duty and of zeal
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness
We judge no less Uncle of Exeter Enlarge the man committed yesterday That railed against our person
That’s mercy but too much security
Oh let us yet be merciful
And now to our French causes
Who are the late commissioners
I one my lord
Your Highness bade me ask for it today
So did you me my liege
And I my royal sovereign
I do confess my fault And do submit me to Your Highness' mercy
To which we all appeal
The mercy that was quick in us but late By your own counsel is suppressed and killed
Tis so strange That though the truth of it stands off as gross As black and white my eye will scarcely see it
Treason and murder ever kept together As two yoke devils sworn to either’s purpose Working so grossly in a natural cause That admiration did not whoop at them
All other devils that suggest by treasons Do botch and bungle up damnation With patches colors and with forms being fetched From glist'ring semblances of piety
But he that tempered thee bade thee stand up Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
If that same demon that hath gulled thee thus Should with his lion gait walk the whole world He might return to vasty Tartar back And tell the legions “I can never win A soul so easy as that Englishman’s” Oh how hast thou with jealousy infected The sweetness of affiance
Why so didst thou
Why so didst thou
Come they of noble family
Why so didst thou
Seem they religious
Why so didst thou
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot To mark the full fraught man and best endued With some suspicion
I will weep for thee For this revolt of thine methinks is like Another fall of man Their faults are open
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard Earl of Cambridge
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland
Our purposes God justly hath discovered And I repent my fault more than my death Which I beseech Your Highness to forgive Although my body pay the price of it
For me the gold of France did not seduce Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended But God be thankèd for prevention Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice Beseeching God and you to pardon me
Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself Prevented from a damnèd enterprise
My fault but not my body pardon sovereign
God quit you in His mercy
Touching our person seek we no revenge But we our kingdom’s safety must so tender Whose ruin you have sought that to her laws We do deliver you
Get you therefore hence Poor miserable wretches to your death The taste whereof God of His mercy give You patience to endure and true repentance Of all your dear offences Bear them hence
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings
We doubt not now But every rub is smoothèd on our way
Then forth dear countrymen
No king of England if not king of France
For Falstaff he is dead and we must earn therefore
He’s in Arthur’s bosom if ever man went to Arthur’s bosom
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet
They say he cried out of sack
Ay that he did
And of women
Nay that he did not
A could never abide carnation
Twas a color he never liked
He said once the devil would have him about women
He did in some sort indeed handle women but then he was rheumatic and talked of the Whore of Babylon
Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon Bardolph’s nose and he said it was a black soul burning in hell
Shall we shog
The King will be gone from Southampton
Look to my chattels and my movables
ThereforeGo clear thy crystals Yoke fellows in arms Let us to France like horse leeches my boys To suck to suck the very blood to suck
My lord I’ll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th' eleventh year of the last king’s reign Was like and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question
But how my lord shall we resist it now
It must be thought on
If it pass against us We lose the better half of our possession For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the Church Would they strip from us being valued thus “As much as would maintain to the King’s honor Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights Six thousand and two hundred good esquires And to relief of lazars and weak age Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil A hundred almshouses right well supplied And to the coffers of the King besides A thousand pounds by th' year” Thus runs the bill
This would drink deep
But what prevention
The king is full of grace and fair regard
And a true lover of the holy Church
And that’s but unwholesome food they say
Touch her soft mouth and march
Farewell hostess
Let housewifery appear
Keep close I thee command
Farewell
Adieu
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany Of Brabant and of Orléans shall make forth And you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch To line and new repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant
For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf
And let us do it with no show of fear No with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris dance
For my good liege she is so idly kinged Her scepter so fantastically borne By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth That fear attends her not
Oh peace Prince Dauphin
You are too much mistaken in this king
Question your Grace the late ambassadors With what great state he heard their embassy How well supplied with noble counselors How modest in exception and withal How terrible in constant resolution And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus Covering discretion with a coat of folly As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate
Well ’tis not so my Lord High Constable
But though we think it so it is no matter
In cases of defense ’tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems
Up in the air crowned with the golden sun Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made
This is a stem Of that victorious stock and let us fear The native mightiness and fate of him
Ambassadors from Harry King of England Do crave admittance to your Majesty
We’ll give them present audience
Go and bring them
Good my sovereign Take up the English short and let them know Of what a monarchy you are the head
Self love my liege is not so vile a sin As self neglecting
From our brother England
Or else what follows
Bloody constraint for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts there will he rake for it
For us we will consider of this further
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother England
For the Dauphin I stand here for him
What to him from England
Scorn and defiance slight regard contempt And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender doth he prize you at
Thus says my king an if your father’s Highness Do not in grant of all demands at large Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty He’ll call you to so hot an answer of it That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordinance
To that end As matching to his youth and vanity I did present him with the Paris balls
He’ll make your Paris Louvre shake for it Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe
And be assured you’ll find a difference As we his subjects have in wonder found Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full
Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay For he is footed in this land already
You shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions
A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought
Play with your fancies and in them behold Upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give To sounds confused
Behold the threaden sails Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea Breasting the lofty surge
Oh do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on th' inconstant billows dancing For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur
Follow follow
Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
Behold the ordnance on their carriages With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur
Suppose th' Ambassador from the French comes back Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Katherine his daughter and with her to dowry Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
Still be kind And eke out our performance with your mind
Once more unto the breach dear friends once more Or close the wall up with our English dead
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height
On on you noblest English Whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof Fathers that like so many Alexanders Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument
Dishonor not your mothers
Now attest That those whom you called fathers did beget you
And you good yeoman Whose limbs were made in England show us here The mettle of your pasture
Let us swear That you are worth your breeding which I doubt not
We are blessèd in the change
List his discourse of war and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music
Follow your spirit and upon this charge Cry “God for Harry England and Saint George”
On on on on on
To the breach to the breach
Pray thee corporal stay
The plainsong” is most just for humors do abound
Would I were in an alehouse in London
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety
And I
Up to the breach you dogs
Avaunt you cullions
Be merciful great duke to men of mold
Good bawcock 'bate thy rage
Use lenity sweet chuck
These be good humors
Your Honor wins bad humors
As young as I am I have observed these three swashers
I am boy to them all three but all they three though they would serve me could not be man to me
They will steal anything and call it purchase
They would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood if I should take from another’s pocket to put into mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs
I must leave them and seek some better service
Their villainy goes against my weak stomach and therefore I must cast it up
To the mines
The concavities of it is not sufficient for look you th' athversary you may discuss unto the duke look you is digt himself four yard under the countermines
By Cheshu I think he will plow up all if there is not better directions
The duke of Gloucester to whom the order of the siege is given is altogether directed by an Irishman a very valiant gentleman i' faith
It is Captain Macmorris is it not
I think it be
By Cheshu he is an ass as in the world
I will verify as much in his beard
He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars look you of the Roman disciplines than is a puppy dog
Here he comes and the Scots captain Captain Jamy with him
Captain Jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman that is certain and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient wars upon my particular knowledge of his directions
By Cheshu he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans
I say gudday Captain Fluellen
Godden to your Worship good Captain James
How now Captain Macmorris have you quit the mines
Have the pioneers given o'er
By Chrish la ’tish ill done
By my hand I swear and my father’s soul the work ish ill done
It ish give over
I would have blowed up the town so Chrish save me la in an hour
Oh ’tish ill done ’tish ill done by my hand ’tish ill done
Captain Macmorris I beseech you now will you voutsafe me look you a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war the Roman wars
In the way of argument look you and friendly communication partly to satisfy my opinion and partly for the satisfaction look you of my mind as touching the direction of the military discipline that is the point
What enterprise Popillius
Fare you well
Look how he makes to Caesar
Mark him
Casca be sudden for we fear prevention  Brutus what shall be done
If this be known Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back For I will slay myself
Cassius be constant
Trebonius knows his time
Where is Metellus Cimber
Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar
He is addressed
Press near and second him
Casca you are the first that rears your hand
Are we all ready
Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart      I must prevent thee Cimber
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children
What Brutus
I could be well moved if I were as you
If I could pray to move prayers would move me
But I am constant as the northern star Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament
The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks
So in the world
And that I am he Let me a little show it even in this That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so
Hence
Wilt thou lift up Olympus
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel
Speak hands for me
Liberty
Freedom
Tyranny is dead
Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
Some to the common pulpits and cry out “Liberty freedom and enfranchisement” People and senators be not affrighted
Fly not
Go to the pulpit Brutus
And Cassius too
Where’s Publius
Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance  Talk not of standing Publius good cheer
There is no harm intended to your person Nor to no Roman else
So tell them Publius
And leave us Publius lest that the people Rushing on us should do your age some mischief
Do so
And let no man abide this deed But we the doers
Where is Antony
Fled to his house amazed
Men wives and children stare cry out and run As it were doomsday
Why he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death
Stoop Romans stoop And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords
Then walk we forth even to the marketplace And waving our red weapons o'er our heads Let’s all cry “Peace freedom and liberty” Stoop then and wash
Who calls
Bid every noise be still
Peace yet again
Who is it in the press that calls on me
I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry “Caesar” Speak
Caesar is turned to hear
Beware the ides of March
What man is that
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March
Set him before me
Let me see his face
Fellow come from the throng
Look upon Caesar
What sayst thou to me now
Speak once again
Beware the ides of March
He is a dreamer
Let us leave him
Pass
Will you go see the order of the course
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust
Ay every man away
Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome
Soft
Who comes here
A friend of Antony’s
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman
I never thought him worse
Tell him so please him come unto this place He shall be satisfied and by my honor Depart untouched
I know that we shall have him well to friend
But here comes Antony Welcome Mark Antony
O mighty Caesar
Dost thou lie so low
Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils Shrunk to this little measure
Fare thee well
I know not gentlemen what you intend Who else must be let blood who else is rank
If I myself there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world
I do beseech ye if you bear me hard Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke Fulfill your pleasure
Live a thousand years I shall not find myself so apt to die
No place will please me so no mean of death As here by Caesar and by you cut off The choice and master spirits of this age
O Antony beg not your death of us
They are pitiful
And pity to the general wrong of Rome  As fire drives out fire so pity pity  Hath done this deed on Caesar
For your part To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony
Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers' temper do receive you in With all kind love good thoughts and reverence
Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude beside themselves with fear And then we will deliver you the cause Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him Have thus proceeded
I doubt not of your wisdom
Let each man render me his bloody hand
Mark Antony  Pardon me Caius Cassius
Therefore I took your hands but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar
Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you Antony the son of Caesar You should be satisfied
You shall Mark Antony
Brutus a word with you
It shall advantage more than do us wrong
Mark Antony here take you Caesar’s body
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission
And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going After my speech is ended
Be it so
I do desire no more
Prepare the body then and follow us
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy  Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue  A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
I do Mark Antony
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
He did receive his letters and is coming
Passion I see is catching for mine eyes Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine Began to water
Is thy master coming
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace
Lend me your hand
We will be satisfied
Let us be satisfied
Then follow me and give me audience friends
Cassius go you into the other street And part the numbers
Those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here
Those that will follow Cassius go with him And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death
I will hear Brutus speak
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd
The noble Brutus is ascended
Be patient till the last
Romans countrymen and lovers
Hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear
Believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe
Censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge
If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesar’s to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live all free men
As Caesar loved me I weep for him
As he was fortunate I rejoice at it
As he was valiant I honor him
But as he was ambitious I slew him
There is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition
Who is here so base that would be a bondman
If any speak for him have I offended
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman
If any speak for him have I offended
Who is here so vile that will not love his country
If any speak for him have I offended
I pause for a reply
None Brutus none
Then none have I offended
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol
His glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death
Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not
Live Brutus
Live live
Bring him with triumph home unto his house
I am not gamesome
I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony
Let me not hinder Cassius your desires
I’ll leave you
Cassius Be not deceived
Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
Let him be Caesar
Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors
My countrymen      Peace silence
Brutus speaks
Peace ho
Good countrymen let me depart alone
I do entreat you not a man depart Save I alone till Antony have spoke
Let him go up into the public chair
We’ll hear him Noble Antony go up
For Brutus' sake I am beholding to you
What does he say of Brutus
He says for Brutus' sake He finds himself beholding to us all
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here
This Caesar was a tyrant
Nay that’s certain
We are blest that Rome is rid of him
Peace
Let us hear what Antony can say
You gentle Romans      Peace ho
Let us hear him
Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
I come to bury Caesar not to praise him
The evil that men do lives after them The good is oft interrèd with their bones
So let it be with Caesar
The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious
If it were so it was a grievous fault And grievously hath Caesar answered it
Here under leave of Brutus and the rest  For Brutus is an honorable man So are they all all honorable men  Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral
He was my friend faithful and just to me
But Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honorable man
He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious
When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honorable man
You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown Which he did thrice refuse
Was this ambition
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke But here I am to speak what I do know
If thou consider rightly of the matter Caesar has had great wrong
Has he masters
He would not take the crown
Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious
If it be found so some will dear abide it
Poor soul
His eyes are red as fire with weeping
There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world
Now lies he there And none so poor to do him reverence
O masters if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong  Who you all know are honorable men
I will not do them wrong
I rather choose To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you Than I will wrong such honorable men
But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar
Let but the commons hear this testament  Which pardon me I do not mean to read  And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood Yea beg a hair of him for memory And dying mention it within their wills Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue
We’ll hear the will
Read it Mark Antony
The will the will
We will hear Caesar’s will
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you
You are not wood you are not stones but men
And being men bearing the will of Caesar It will inflame you it will make you mad
Read the will
We’ll hear it Antony
You shall read us the will Caesar’s will
Will you be patient
Will you stay awhile
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar
They were traitors
The testament
They were villains murderers
The will
Read the will
You will compel me then to read the will
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar And let me show you him that made the will
Shall I descend
And will you give me leave
Come down
Descend
You shall have leave
Stand from the hearse
Stand from the body
Room for Antony most noble Antony
Nay press not so upon me
Stand far off
Stand back
Room
If you have tears prepare to shed them now
You all do know this mantle
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on
Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent That day he overcame the Nervii
Look in this place ran Cassius' dagger through
See what a rent the envious Casca made
For Brutus as you know was Caesar’s angel
Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
This was the most unkindest cut of all
Then burst his mighty heart And in his mantle muffling up his face Even at the base of Pompey’s statue Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell
O what a fall was there my countrymen
Then I and you and all of us fell down Whilst bloody treason flourished over us
Oh now you weep and I perceive you feel The dint of pity
These are gracious drops
Kind souls what weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded
Look you here Here is himself marred as you see with traitors
O piteous spectacle
O noble Caesar
O woeful day
O traitors villains
O most bloody sight
About
Seek
Burn
Fire
Kill
Slay
Stay countrymen
Peace there
Hear the noble Antony
They that have done this deed are honorable
What private griefs they have alas I know not That made them do it
They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you
I come not friends to steal away your hearts
For I have neither wit nor words nor worth Action nor utterance nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood
I only speak right on
But were I Brutus And Brutus Antony there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny
We’ll mutiny
We’ll burn the house of Brutus
Away then
Come seek the conspirators
Yet hear me countrymen
Yet hear me speak
Peace ho
Hear Antony
Most noble Antony
Why friends you go to do you know not what
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves
Alas you know not
I must tell you then
You have forgot the will I told you of
Most true
The will
Let’s stay and hear the will
Most noble Caesar
We’ll revenge his death
O royal Caesar
Hear me with patience
Peace ho
Moreover he hath left you all his walks His private arbors and new planted orchards On this side Tiber
He hath left them you And to your heirs forever common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves
Here was a Caesar
When comes such another
We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors' houses
Take up the body
Go fetch fire
Now let it work
How now fellow
Sir Octavius is already come to Rome
Where is he
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house
And thither will I straight to visit him
He comes upon a wish
Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them
Bring me to Octavius
Tis just
And it is very much lamented Brutus That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow
I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes
Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me
Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear
And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of
And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus
Were I a common laugher or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout then hold me dangerous
What means this shouting
I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king
Ay do you fear it
Then must I think you would not have it so
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar And things unlucky charge my fantasy
I have no will to wander forth of doors Yet something leads me forth
What is your name
Whither are you going
Where do you dwell
Are you a married man or a bachelor
Answer every man directly
Ay and briefly
Ay and wisely
What is my name
Whither am I going
Where do I dwell
Am I a married man or a bachelor
Then to answer every man directly and briefly wisely and truly wisely I say I am a bachelor
That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry
You’ll bear me a bang for that I fear
Directly I am going to Caesar’s funeral
As a friend or an enemy
As a friend
Briefly I dwell by the Capitol
Your name sir truly
Truly my name is Cinna
Tear him to pieces
He’s a conspirator
I am not Cinna the conspirator
It is no matter
His name’s Cinna
Pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going
Tear him tear him
Come brands ho firebrands
To Brutus' to Cassius' burn all
Some to Decius' house and some to Casca’s
Some to Ligarius'
Away go
These many then shall die
Their names are pricked
I do consent     Prick him down Antony
Upon condition Publius shall not live Who is your sister’s son Mark Antony
He shall not live
Look with a spot I damn him
But Lepidus go you to Caesar’s house
Fetch the will hither and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies
What shall I find you here
Or here or at the Capitol
This is a slight unmeritable man Meet to be sent on errands
Is it fit The threefold world divided he should stand One of the three to share it
Octavius I have seen more days than you
And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold To groan and sweat under the business Either led or driven as we point the way
And having brought our treasure where we will Then take we down his load and turn him off Like to the empty ass to shake his ears And graze in commons
You may do your will But he’s a tried and valiant soldier
So is my horse Octavius and for that I do appoint him store of provender
Stand ho
Give the word ho and stand
What now Lucillius
Is Cassius near
He is at hand and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master
But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied
He is not doubted A word Lucillius
But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith
But hollow men like horses hot at hand Make gallant show and promise of their mettle
But when they should endure the bloody spur They fall their crests and like deceitful jades Sink in the trial
Comes his army on
They mean this night in Sardis to be quartered
The greater part the horse in general Are come with Cassius
Hark
He is arrived
March gently on to meet him
Stand ho
Stand ho
Speak the word along
Stand
Stand
Stand
Most noble brother you have done me wrong
Judge me you gods
Wrong I mine enemies
And when you do them      Cassius be content
Before the eyes of both our armies here Which should perceive nothing but love from us Let us not wrangle
Bid them move away
Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs And I will give you audience
Pindarus Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door
That you have wronged me doth appear in this You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians Wherein my letters praying on his side Because I knew the man were slighted off
You wronged yourself to write in such a case
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment
Let me tell you Cassius you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers
I “an itching palm”
You know that you are Brutus that speak this Or by the gods this speech were else your last
The name of Cassius honors this corruption And chastisement doth therefore hide his head
Chastisement
Remember March the ides of March remember
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake
What villain touched his body that did stab And not for justice
What shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be graspèd thus
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman
Brutus bait not me
I’ll not endure it
You forget yourself To hedge me in
I am a soldier I Older in practice abler than yourself To make conditions
Go to
You are not Cassius
I am
I say you are not
Urge me no more I shall forget myself
Have mind upon your health tempt me no further
Away slight man
Is ’t possible
Hear me for I will speak
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares
But wherefore do you hold me here so long
What is it that you would impart to me
I know that virtue to be in you Brutus As well as I do know your outward favor
Well honor is the subject of my story
I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life but for my single self I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself
I was born free as Caesar
So were you
We both have fed as well and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he
For once upon a raw and gusty day The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores Caesar said to me “Darest thou Cassius now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point” Upon the word Accoutred as I was I plungèd in And bade him follow
So indeed he did
But ere we could arrive the point proposed Caesar cried “Help me Cassius or I sink” I as Aeneas our great ancestor Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar
All this”
Ay more
Fret till your proud heart break
Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble
Is it come to this
You say you are a better soldier
Let it appear so
Make your vaunting true And it shall please me well
For mine own part I shall be glad to learn of noble men
You wrong me every way
You wrong me Brutus
When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
Peace peace
You durst not so have tempted him
I durst not
No
For your life you durst not
Do not presume too much upon my love
I may do that I shall be sorry for
You have done that you should be sorry for
There is no terror Cassius in your threats For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind Which I respect not
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions Which you denied me
Was that done like Cassius
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so
I denied you not
You did
I did not
He was but a fool that brought My answer back
Brutus hath rived my heart
A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities But Brutus makes mine greater than they are
I do not till you practice them on me
You love me not
I do not like your faults
A friendly eye could never see such faults
A flatterer’s would not though they do appear As huge as high Olympus
Oh I could weep My spirit from mine eyes
Sheathe your dagger
Be angry when you will it shall have scope
Do what you will dishonor shall be humor
When I spoke that I was ill tempered too
Do you confess so much
Give me your hand
And my heart too
O Brutus
What’s the matter
Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful
Yes Cassius
And from henceforth When you are over earnest with your Brutus He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so
How now
What’s the matter
For shame you generals
What do you mean
Love and be friends as two such men should be
For I have seen more years I’m sure than ye
Bear with him Brutus
Tis his fashion
I’ll know his humor when he knows his time
What should the wars do with these jigging fools
Companion hence
Away away be gone
Lucillius and Titinius bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you Immediately to us
I did not think you could have been so angry
O Cassius I am sick of many griefs
Portia is dead
Ha Portia
She is dead
O insupportable and touching loss
Upon what sickness
Impatient of my absence And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong for with her death That tidings came with this she fell distract And her attendants absent swallowed fire
And died so
Even so
O ye immortal gods
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
Fill Lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love
Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities
Portia art thou gone
No more I pray you
Messala I have here receivèd letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power Bending their expedition toward Philippi
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor
With what addition
That by proscription and bills of outlawry Octavius Antony and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators
Therein our letters do not well agree
Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions Cicero being one
Cicero one
Cicero is dead And by that order of proscription
No Messala
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her
Nothing Messala
That methinks is strange
Why ask you
Hear you aught of her in yours
No my lord
Now as you are a Roman tell me true
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell
For certain she is dead and by strange manner
Why farewell Portia
We must die Messala
With meditating that she must die once I have the patience to endure it now
Even so great men great losses should endure
I have as much of this in art as you But yet my nature could not bear it so
Well to our work alive
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently
I do not think it good
Your reason
This it is 'Tis better that the enemy seek us
So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers Doing himself offense whilst we lying still Are full of rest defense and nimbleness
The enemy marching along by them By them shall make a fuller number up Come on refreshed new added and encouraged From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there These people at our back
Hear me good brother  Under your pardon
You must note beside That we have tried the utmost of our friends Our legions are brim full our cause is ripe
The enemy increaseth every day
We at the height are ready to decline
On such a full sea are we now afloat And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures
Then with your will go on
We’ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi
The deep of night is crept upon our talk And nature must obey necessity Which we will niggard with a little rest
There is no more to say
No more
Good night
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence
Lucius
Never come such division ’tween our souls
Let it not Brutus
Is now become a god and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him
He had a fever when he was in Spain And when the fit was on him I did mark How he did shake
Tis true this god did shake
His coward lips did from their color fly And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster
I did hear him groan Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books  “Alas” it cried “give me some drink Titinius” As a sick girl
Ye gods it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone
Another general shout
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar
Why man he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves
Men at some time are masters of their fates
The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars But in ourselves that we are underlings
Brutus and Caesar what should be in that “Caesar”
Why should that name be sounded more than yours
Write them together yours is as fair a name
Sound them it doth become the mouth as well
Everything is well
Good night my lord
Good night good brother
Good night Lord Brutus
Farewell everyone
Give me the gown
Where is thy instrument
Here in the tent
What thou speak’st drowsily
Call Claudio and some other of my men
I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent
Varrus and Claudio
Calls my lord
I pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep
It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius
So please you we will stand and watch your pleasure
Look Lucius here’s the book I sought for so
I put it in the pocket of my gown
I was sure your lordship did not give it me
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile And touch thy instrument a strain or two
Ay my lord an ’t please you
It does my boy
I trouble thee too much but thou art willing
It is my duty sir
I should not urge thy duty past thy might
I know young bloods look for a time of rest
I have slept my lord already
It was well done and thou shalt sleep again
I will not hold thee long
If I do live I will be good to thee
This is a sleepy tune
O murderous slumber Layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music Gentle knave good night
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee
And good boy good night
Let me see let me see
Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading
Here it is I think
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition
It comes upon me Art thou any thing
Art thou some god some angel or some devil That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare
Speak to me what thou art
Thy evil spirit Brutus
Why comest thou
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi
Well then I shall see thee again
Ay at Philippi
Why I will see thee at Philippi then
Ill spirit I would hold more talk with thee
Claudio
The strings my lord are false
He thinks he still is at his instrument
Lucius awake
My lord
Didst thou dream Lucius that thou so criedst out
My lord I do not know that I did cry
Yes that thou didst
Didst thou see any thing
Nothing my lord
My lord
My lord
Why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep
Did we my lord
Ay
Saw you anything
No my lord I saw nothing
Nor I my lord
Go and commend me to my brother Cassius
Bid him set on his powers betimes before And we will follow
It shall be done my lord
Now Antony our hopes are answerèd
You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions
It proves not so
Their battles are at hand
They mean to warn us at Philippi here Answering before we do demand of them
Tut I am in their bosoms and I know Wherefore they do it
They could be content To visit other places and come down With fearful bravery thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
But ’tis not so
Prepare you generals
The enemy comes on in gallant show
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out And something to be done immediately
Octavius lead your battle softly on Upon the left hand of the even field
Upon the right hand I
Keep thou the left
Why do you cross me in this exigent
They stand and would have parley
Stand fast Titinius
We must out and talk
Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle
No Caesar we will answer on their charge
Make forth
The generals would have some words
Words before blows
Is it so countrymen
Not that we love words better as you do
Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
But for your words they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless
Not stingless too
Villains you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar
Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself
When think you that the sword goes up again
Never till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
Caesar thou canst not die by traitors' hands Unless thou bring’st them with thee
So I hope
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword
O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain Young man thou couldst not die more honorable
A peevish schoolboy worthless of such honor Joined with a masker and a reveler
Old Cassius still
If you dare fight today come to the field
If not when you have stomachs
Why now blow wind swell billow and swim bark
The storm is up and all is on the hazard
Messala
Messala This is my birthday as this very day Was Cassius born
Give me thy hand Messala
Be thou my witness that against my will As Pompey was am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties
You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion
Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage
Coming from Sardis on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell and there they perched Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands Who to Philippi here consorted us
This morning are they fled away and gone And in their steads do ravens crows and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey
Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal under which Our army lies ready to give up the ghost
Believe not so
I but believe it partly For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly
Now most noble Brutus The gods today stand friendly that we may Lovers in peace lead on our days to age
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain Let’s reason with the worst that may befall
If we do lose this battle then is this The very last time we shall speak together
What are you then determinèd to do
Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar” Now in the names of all the gods at once Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great
Age thou art shamed
Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
When went there by an age since the great flood But it was famed with more than with one man
When could they say till now that talked of Rome That her wide walks encompassed but one man
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough When there is in it but one only man
Oh you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king
That you do love me I am nothing jealous
What you would work me to I have some aim
How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter
For this present I would not so with love I might entreat you Be any further moved
What you have said I will consider what you have to say I will with patience hear and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things
Till then my noble friend chew upon this Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus
Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome
No Cassius no
Think not thou noble Roman That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome
He bears too great a mind
Therefore our everlasting farewell take
Forever and forever farewell Cassius
If we do meet again why we shall smile
If not why then this parting was well made
Forever and forever farewell Brutus
If we do meet again we’ll smile indeed
If not ’tis true this parting was well made
Why then lead on
Oh that a man might know The end of this day’s business ere it come
But it sufficeth that the day will end And then the end is known Come ho
Away
Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side
Let them set on at once for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing And sudden push gives them the overthrow
Ride ride Messala
Myself have to mine own turned enemy
O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early Who having some advantage on Octavius Took it too eagerly
Fly further off my lord fly further off
Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire
They are my lord
Titinius if thou lovest me Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy
I will be here again even with a thought
Go Pindarus get higher on that hill
My sight was ever thick
Regard Titinius And tell me what thou notest about the field
This day I breathed first
Time is come round And where I did begin there shall I end
My life is run his compass
What news
And hark
They shout for joy
Come down behold no more
Oh coward that I am to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face
Come hither sirrah
Come now keep thine oath
Caesar thou art revenged Even with the sword that killed thee
So I am free
Yet would not so have been Durst I have done my will
O Cassius Far from this country Pindarus shall run Where never Roman shall take note of him
It is but change Titinius for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power As Cassius' legions are by Antony
These tidings will well comfort Cassius
Where did you leave him
All disconsolate With Pindarus his bondman on this hill
Is not that he that lies upon the ground
He lies not like the living
O my heart
Is not that he
What Pindarus
Where art thou Pindarus
Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus thrusting this report Into his ears
I may say “thrusting” it For piercing steel and darts envenomèd Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight
Hie you Messala And I will seek for Pindarus the while
Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius
Did I not meet thy friends
And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee
Didst thou not hear their shouts
Alas thou hast misconstrued everything
But hold thee take this garland on thy brow
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I Will do his bidding
Where where Messala doth his body lie
Lo yonder and Titinius mourning it
Titinius' face is upward
He is slain
O Julius Caesar thou art mighty yet
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails
Are yet two Romans living such as these
The last of all the Romans fare thee well
I shall find time Cassius I shall find time
Come therefore and to Thasos send his body
Let us to the field
Labio and Flavio set our battles on
Tis three o'clock and Romans yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight
What bastard doth not
Who will go with me
I will proclaim my name about the field
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho
A foe to tyrants and my country’s friend
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho
And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus I
Brutus my country’s friend
Know me for Brutus
O young and noble Cato art thou down
Only I yield to die
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight
Kill Brutus and be honored in his death
We must not
A noble prisoner
Room ho
Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en
I’ll tell the news
Where is he
Safe Antony
I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus
The gods defend him from so great a shame
The games are done and Caesar is returning
As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve And he will after his sour fashion tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today
I will do so
But look you Cassius The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow And all the rest look like a chidden train
Calphurnia’s cheek is pale and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being crossed in conference by some senators
Casca will tell us what the matter is
Antonio
Caesar
Come poor remains of friends rest on this rock
Statilius showed the torchlight but my lord He came not back
He is or ta'en or slain
Sit thee down Clitus
Hark thee Clitus
What I my lord
No not for all the world
Peace then
No words
I’ll rather kill myself
Hark thee Dardanius
Shall I do such a deed
O Dardanius
O Clitus
Come hither good Volumnius
List a word
What says my lord
At Sardis once And this last night here in Philippi fields
I know my hour is come
Not so my lord
Nay I am sure it is Volumnius
Thou seest the world Volumnius how it goes
Our enemies have beat us to the pit
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us
Good Volumnius Thou know’st that we two went to school together
Even for that our love of old I prithee Hold thou my sword hilts whilst I run on it
That’s not an office for a friend my lord
Fly fly my lord
There is no tarrying here
Farewell to you And you And you Volumnius
Strato thou hast been all this while asleep
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto
So fare you well at once for Brutus' tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history
Night hangs upon mine eyes
My bones would rest That have but labored to attain this hour
Fly my lord fly
Hence
I will follow
I prithee Strato stay thou by thy lord
Thou art a fellow of a good respect
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face While I do run upon it
Wilt thou Strato
Give me your hand first
Farewell good Strato
What man is that
Free from the bondage you are in Messala
All that served Brutus I will entertain them
Fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me
Ay if Messala will prefer me to you
Do so good Messala
How died my master Strato
I held the sword and he did run on it
Octavius then take him to follow thee That did the latest service to my master
This was the noblest Roman of them all
All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar
He only in a general honest thought And common good to all made one of them
His life was gentle and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world “This was a man” According to his virtue let us use him With all respect and rites of burial
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie Most like a soldier ordered honorably
So call the field to rest and let’s away To part the glories of this happy day
Ay Casca
Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad
Why you were with him were you not
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced
Why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting
What was the second noise for
Why for that too
They shouted thrice
What was the last cry for
Why for that too
Was the crown offered him thrice
Ay marry was ’t and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted
Who offered him the crown
Why Antony
Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither ’twas one of these coronets) and as I told you he put it by once but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it
Then he offered it to him again then he put it by again but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it
And then he offered it the third time
And for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air
But soft I pray you
What did Caesar swoon
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless
Tis very like
He hath the falling sickness
No Caesar hath it not
But you and I And honest Casca we have the falling sickness
I know not what you mean by that but I am sure Caesar fell down
What said he when he came unto himself
Marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut
An I had been a man of any occupation if I would not have taken him at a word I would I might go to hell among the rogues
And so he fell
When he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity
Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas good soul” and forgave him with all their hearts
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less
And after that he came thus sad away
Ay
Hence
Home you idle creatures get you home
Is this a holiday
Why sir a carpenter
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule
What dost thou with thy best apparel on
Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but as you would say a cobbler
But what trade art thou
Answer me directly
A trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
What trade thou knave
Thou naughty knave what trade
Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me
Yet if you be out sir I can mend you
What mean’st thou by that
Mend” me thou saucy fellow
Did Cicero say anything
Ay he spoke Greek
To what effect
Nay an I tell you that I’ll ne'er look you i' th' face again
But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads
But for mine own part it was Greek to me
I could tell you more news too
Murellus and Flavius for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images are put to silence
Fare you well
There was more foolery yet if I could remember it
Will you sup with me tonight Casca
No I am promised forth
Will you dine with me tomorrow
Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating
Good
I will expect you
Do so
Farewell both
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be
He was quick mettle when he went to school
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise However he puts on this tardy form
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite
And so it is
For this time I will leave you
Tomorrow if you please to speak with me I will come home to you
Or if you will Come home to me and I will wait for you
I will do so
Till then think of the world
Well Brutus thou art noble
Caesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius He should not humor me
I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw As if they came from several citizens Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at
Brought you Caesar home
O Cicero I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen Th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds But never till tonight never till now Did I go through a tempest dropping fire
Either there is a civil strife in heaven Or else the world too saucy with the gods Incenses them to send destruction
Besides I ha' not since put up my sword  Against the Capitol I met a lion Who glared upon me and went surly by Without annoying me
And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women Transformèd with their fear who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets
And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon day upon the marketplace Hooting and shrieking
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet let not men say “These are their reasons
They are natural” For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon
Indeed it is a strange disposèd time
But men may construe things after their fashion Clean from the purpose of the things themselves
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow
He doth for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow
Good night then Casca
This disturbèd sky Is not to walk in
A Roman
Casca by your voice
Your ear is good
Cassius what night is this
A very pleasing night to honest men
Who ever knew the heavens menace so
Those that have known the earth so full of faults
For my part I have walked about the streets Submitting me unto the perilous night And thus unbracèd Casca as you see Have bared my bosom to the thunder stone
And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open The breast of heaven I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us
You are dull Casca and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want Or else you use not
You look pale and gaze And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens
A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action yet prodigious grown And fearful as these strange eruptions are
Let it be who it is
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy
I know where I will wear this dagger then
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit
But life being weary of these worldly bars Never lacks power to dismiss itself
If I know this know all the world besides That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure
So can I
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then
Poor man
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
He were no lion were not Romans hinds
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws
But O grief Where hast thou led me
Then I know My answer must be made
You speak to Casca and to such a man That is no fleering telltale
Hold my hand
Be factious for redress of all these griefs And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest
There’s a bargain made
Now know you Casca I have moved already Some certain of the noblest minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable dangerous consequence
And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey’s porch
Tis Cinna
I do know him by his gait
To find out you
Who’s that
Metellus Cimber
No it is Casca one incorporate To our attempts
Am I not stayed for Cinna
I am glad on ’t
What a fearful night is this
There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights
Am I not stayed for
Tell me
Yes you are
O Cassius if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party  Be you content
Good Cinna take this paper And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair Where Brutus may but find it
All this done Repair to Pompey’s porch where you shall find us
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
All but Metellus Cimber and he’s gone To seek you at your house
Well I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade me
That done repair to Pompey’s theatre
Come Casca you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited
Let us go For it is after midnight and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him
Awake I say
What Lucius
Called you my lord
Get me a taper in my study Lucius
When it is lighted come and call me here
I will my lord
It must be by his death and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general
He would be crowned
How that might change his nature there’s the question
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking
Crown him that And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with
Why sir cobble you
Thou art a cobbler art thou
Truly sir all that I live by is with the awl
I meddle with no tradesman’s matters nor women’s matters but withal I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes
When they are in great danger I recover them
As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork
But wherefore art not in thy shop today
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets
Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work
Wherefore rejoice
What conquest brings he home
What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
Th' abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power
So Caesar may
Then lest he may prevent
And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is Fashion it thus that what he is augmented Would run to these and these extremities
The taper burneth in your closet sir
Searching the window for a flint I found This paper thus sealed up and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed
Get you to bed again
It is not day
Is not tomorrow boy the ides of March
I know not sir
Look in the calendar and bring me word
I will sir
Sir March is wasted fifteen days
Tis good
Go to the gate
Somebody knocks
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar I have not slept
Is he alone
Do you know them
Let 'em enter
O conspiracy Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free
O then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage
Hide it in smiles and affability
I think we are too bold upon your rest
Good morrow Brutus
Do we trouble you
I have been up this hour awake all night
Know I these men that come along with you
This is Trebonius
He is welcome hither
This Decius Brutus
He is welcome too
This Casca
This Cinna
And this Metellus Cimber
They are all welcome
What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night
Shall I entreat a word
Here lies the east
Doth not the day break here
No
You shall confess that you are both deceived
And let us swear our resolution
No not an oath
So let high sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery
But if these  As I am sure they do bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women then countrymen What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged That this shall be or we will fall for it
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs
Unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt
But do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath when every drop of blood That every Roman bears and nobly bears  Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him
But what of Cicero
Shall we sound him
I think he will stand very strong with us
Let us not leave him out
No by no means
O let us have him for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds
It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands
O name him not
Let us not break with him For he will never follow anything That other men begin
Then leave him out
Indeed he is not fit
Decius well urged
I think it is not meet Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar Should outlive Caesar
We shall find of him A shrewd contriver
And you know his means If he improve them may well stretch so far As to annoy us all which to prevent Let Antony and Caesar fall together
Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius To cut the head off and then hack the limbs Like wrath in death and envy afterwards For Antony is but a limb of Caesar
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar And in the spirit of men there is no blood
Oh that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit And not dismember Caesar
But alas Caesar must bleed for it
And gentle friends Let’s kill him boldly but not wrathfully
Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
And let our hearts as subtle masters do Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em
This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious Which so appearing to the common eyes We shall be called purgers not murderers
If he love Caesar all that he can do Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar
And that were much he should for he is given To sports to wildness and much company
There is no fear in him
Peace
Count the clock
The clock hath stricken three
Tis time to part
It may be these apparent prodigies The unaccustomed terror of this night And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today
Never fear that
If he be so resolved I can o'ersway him
For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees And bears with glasses elephants with holes Lions with toils and men with flatterers
But when I tell him he hates flatterers He says he does being then most flatterèd
Let me work
For I can give his humor the true bent And I will bring him to the Capitol
Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
By the eighth hour
Is that the uttermost
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
I wonder none of you have thought of him
Now good Metellus go along by him
He loves me well and I have given him reasons
Send him but hither and I’ll fashion him
The morning comes upon ’s
We’ll leave you Brutus
And friends disperse yourselves
But all remember What you have said and show yourselves true Romans
Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
And so good morrow to you every one
Boy
Lucius Fast asleep
It is no matter
Enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber
Therefore thou sleep’st so sound
Brutus my lord
Portia what mean you
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morning
Nor for yours neither
Y' have ungently Brutus Stole from my bed
And yesternight at supper You suddenly arose and walked about Musing and sighing with your arms across And when I asked you what the matter was You stared upon me with ungentle looks
I urged you further then you scratched your head And too impatiently stamped with your foot
Yet I insisted yet you answered not But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you
Dear my lord Make me acquainted with your cause of grief
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood
Be gone
Run to your houses fall upon your knees Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude
Go go good countrymen and for this fault Assemble all the poor men of your sort Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all
Go you down that way towards the Capitol
This way will I Disrobe the images If you do find them decked with ceremonies
May we do so
I’ll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets
So do you too where you perceive them thick
These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness
I am not well in health and that is all
Brutus is wise and were he not in health He would embrace the means to come by it
Why so I do
Good Portia go to bed
Is Brutus sick
And is it physical To walk unbracèd and suck up the humors Of the dank morning
What is Brutus sick And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air To add unto his sickness
Kneel not gentle Portia
You are my true and honorable wife As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart
If this were true then should I know this secret
I grant I am a woman but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
I grant I am a woman but withal A woman well reputed Cato’s daughter
Think you I am no stronger than my sex Being so fathered and so husbanded
Tell me your counsels
I will not disclose 'em
I have made strong proof of my constancy Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh
Can I bear that with patience And not my husband’s secrets
O ye gods Render me worthy of this noble wife
Hark hark
One knocks
Leave me with haste
Lucius who’s that knocking
He is a sick man that would speak with you
Would you were not sick
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor
Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius Had you a healthful ear to hear of it
A piece of work that will make sick men whole
But are not some whole that we must make sick
That must we also
What it is my Caius I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done
Follow me then
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out “Help ho
They murder Caesar” Who’s within
My lord
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success
I will my lord
What mean you Caesar
Think you to walk forth
You shall not stir out of your house today
Caesar shall forth
The things that threatened me Ne'er looked but on my back
When they shall see The face of Caesar they are vanishèd
Caesar I never stood on ceremonies Yet now they fright me
There is one within Besides the things that we have heard and seen Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
A lioness hath whelpèd in the streets And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol
O Caesar
These things are beyond all use And I do fear them
What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar
When beggars die there are no comets seen
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
Cowards die many times before their deaths
The valiant never taste of death but once
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard It seems to me most strange that men should fear Seeing that death a necessary end Will come when it will come
What say the augurers
They would not have you to stir forth today
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth They could not find a heart within the beast
The gods do this in shame of cowardice
Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear
No Caesar shall not
We are two lions littered in one day And I the elder and more terrible
And Caesar shall go forth
Alas my lord Your wisdom is consumed in confidence
Do not go forth today
Call it my fear That keeps you in the house and not your own
We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house And he shall say you are not well today
Mark Antony shall say I am not well And for thy humor I will stay at home
Here’s Decius Brutus
He shall tell them so
Caesar all hail
Good morrow worthy Caesar
I come to fetch you to the senate house
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today
Shall Caesar send a lie
Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth
Decius go tell them Caesar will not come
Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so
The cause is in my will
I will not come
That is enough to satisfy the senate
But for your private satisfaction Because I love you I will let you know
Calphurnia here my wife stays me at home
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today
This dream is all amiss interpreted
It was a vision fair and fortunate
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes In which so many smiling Romans bathed Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood and that great men shall press For tinctures stains relics and cognizance
This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified
And this way have you well expounded it
I have when you have heard what I can say
And know it now the senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar
If you shall send them word you will not come Their minds may change
How foolish do your fears seem now Calphurnia
I am ashamèd I did yield to them
Give me my robe for I will go
And look where Publius is come to fetch me
Good morrow Caesar
Welcome Publius
Good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean
What is ’t o'clock
Caesar ’tis strucken eight
I thank you for your pains and courtesy
So to most noble Caesar
I am to blame to be thus waited for
Now Cinna Now Metellus What Trebonius I have an hour’s talk in store for you
Remember that you call on me today
Be near me that I may remember you
Caesar I will
Good friends go in and taste some wine with me
And we like friends will straightway go together
Calphurnia
Peace ho
Caesar speaks
Calphurnia
Here my lord
Caesar my lord
I shall remember
When Caesar says “do this” it is performed
Set on and leave no ceremony out
Caesar
Caesar beware of Brutus
Take heed of Cassius
Come not near Casca
Have an eye to Cinna
Trust not Trebonius
Mark well Metellus Cimber
Decius Brutus loves thee not
Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius
There is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against Caesar
If thou beest not immortal look about you
Security gives way to conspiracy
The mighty gods defend thee
Thy lover      Artemidorus” Here will I stand till Caesar pass along And as a suitor will I give him this
If thou read this O Caesar thou mayst live
If not the Fates with traitors do contrive
I prithee boy run to the senate house
Stay not to answer me but get thee gone
I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there
Madam what should I do
Run to the Capitol and nothing else
And so return to you and nothing else
Yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well For he went sickly forth
And take good note What Caesar doth what suitors press to him
Hark boy
What noise is that
I hear none madam
Prithee listen well
Sooth madam I hear nothing
Come hither fellow
Which way hast thou been
At mine own house good lady
What is ’t o'clock
About the ninth hour lady
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol
Madam not yet
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol
Thou hast some suit to Caesar hast thou not
That I have lady
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me I shall beseech him to befriend himself
Why know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him
None that I know will be much that I fear may chance
Good morrow to you
Here the street is narrow
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels Of senators of praetors common suitors Will crowd a feeble man almost to death
I’ll get me to a place more void and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along
I must go in
Ay Caesar but not gone
O Caesar read mine first for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer
Read it great Caesar
What touches us ourself shall be last served
Delay not Caesar
Read it instantly
What is the fellow mad
Weapons arms
What’s the matter here
Keep peace upon your lives
He dies that strikes again
What is the matter
The messengers from our sister and the king
What is your difference
Speak
I am scarce in breath my lord
A tailor made thee
Thou art a strange fellow
A tailor make a man
Ay a tailor sir
A stone cutter or painter could not have made him so ill though they had been but two years o' th' trade
Speak yet
Peace sirrah
You beastly knave know you no reverence
Yes sir but anger hath a privilege
Why art thou angry
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool
Why art thou mad old fellow
Why dost thou call him “knave”
What’s his offense
His countenance likes me not
No more perchance does mine nor his nor hers
This is some fellow Who having been praised for bluntness doth affect A saucy roughness and constrains the garb Quite from his nature
He cannot flatter he
An honest mind and plain he must speak truth
An they will take it so
If not he’s plain
Sir in good faith or in sincere verity Under th' allowance of your great aspect Whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus' front       What mean’st by this
To go out of my dialect which you discommend so much
I know sir I am no flatterer
I never gave him any
None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool
Call not your stocks for me
I serve the king On whose employment I was sent to you
You shall do small respect show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master Stocking his messenger
Fetch forth the stocks
As I have life and honor there shall he sit till noon
Till noon
Till night my lord and all night too
Why madam if I were your father’s dog You should not use me so
Sir being his knave I will
This is a fellow of the selfsame color Our sister speaks of Come bring away the stocks
Let me beseech your grace not to do so
His fault is much and the good king his master Will check him for ’t
The king his master needs must take it ill That he so slightly valued in his messenger Should have him thus restrained
I’ll answer that
My sister may receive it much more worse To have her gentleman abused assaulted For following her affairs Put in his legs
I am sorry for thee friend
I’ll entreat for thee
Pray you do not sir
A good man’s fortune may grow out at heels
Give you good morrow
The duke’s to blame in this
Twill be ill taken
Obey you love you and most honor you
Haply when I shall wed That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him half my care and duty
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters To love my father all
But goes thy heart with this
Ay good my lord
So young and so untender
So young my lord and true
Let it be so
Thy truth then be thy dower
The barbarous Scythian Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite shall to my bosom Be as well neighbored pitied and relieved As thou my sometime daughter
Good my liege  Peace Kent
I heard myself proclaimed And by the happy hollow of a tree Escaped the hunt
No port is free no place That guard and most unusual vigilance Does not attend my taking
My face I’ll grime with filth Blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky
Poor Turlygod” “Poor Tom”  That’s something yet
Edgar I nothing am
Tis strange that they should so depart from home And not send back my messenger
As I learned The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove
Ha
Makest thou this shame thy pastime
No my lord
Ha ha
Look he wears cruel garters
Horses are tied by the heads dogs and bears by the neck monkeys by the loins and men by the legs
It is both he and she Your son and daughter
No
Yes
No no they would not
Yes they have
By Jupiter I swear “No” By Juno I swear “Ay”    They durst not do ’t
They could not would not do ’t
Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage
My lord when at their home I did commend your highness' letters to them
He raised the house with loud and coward cries
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers
Fathers that wear ragsDo make their children blind
But fathers that bear bagsShall see their children kind
Fortune that arrant whoreNe'er turns the key to th' poor
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year
O how this mother swells up toward my heart
With the earl sir here within
Follow me not
Stay here
Made you no more offense but what you speak of
None
How chance the king comes with so small a train
An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question thou’dst well deserved it
Why Fool
We’ll set thee to school to an ant to teach thee there’s no laboring i' th' winter
All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking
Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following it
But the great one that goes up the hill let him draw thee after
When a wise man gives thee better counsel give me mine again
I would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
That sir which serves and seeks for gainAnd follows but for formWill pack when it begins to rainAnd leave thee in the storm
But I will tarry
The fool will stay
And let the wise man fly
Where learned you this Fool
Not i' th' stocks fool
Deny to speak with me
They are sick
They are weary
The images of revolt and flying off
My dear lord You know the fiery quality of the duke How unremoveable and fixed he is In his own course
Vengeance plague death confusion
Fiery”
What “quality”
Why Gloucester Gloucester I’d speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife
Well my good lord I have informed them so
Informed them”
Dost thou understand me man
Ay my good lord
The king would speak with Cornwall
Are they “informed” of this
My breath and blood
Fiery”
The “fiery” duke
Tell the hot duke that Lear  No but not yet
Maybe he is not well
I would have all well betwixt you
O me my heart my rising heart
But down
Good morrow to you both
Hail to your grace
I am glad to see your highness
Regan I think you are
I know what reason I have to think so if thou shouldst not be glad I would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb Sepulchring an adultress
Belovèd Regan Thy sister’s naught
O Regan she hath tied Sharp toothed unkindness like a vulture here
I pray you sir take patience
Say how is that
I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation
If sir perchance She have restrained the riots of your followers 'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end As clears her from all blame
My curses on her
O sir you are old
Nature in you stands on the very verge Of his confine
You should be ruled and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself
Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return
Say you have wronged her sir
Ask her forgiveness
On my knees I beg That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment bed and food” Good sir no more
These are unsightly tricks
Return you to my sister
Fie sir fie
You nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes
Infect her beauty You fen sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun To fall and blister
O the blessed gods
So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on
Her eyes are fierce but thine Do comfort and not burn
Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot Wherein I thee endowed
Good sir to the purpose
Hence and avoid my sight  So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father’s heart from her Call France
Call Burgundy     Cornwall and Albany With my two daughters' dowers digest this third
Let pride which she calls plainness marry her
Royal Lear Whom I have ever honored as my king Loved as my father as my master followed As my great patron thought on in my prayers  The bow is bent and drawn
Let it fall rather though the fork invade The region of my heart
Be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad
What wouldst thou do old man
Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak When power to flattery bows
To plainness honor’s bound When majesty falls to folly
What trumpet’s that
I know ’t my sister’s
This approves her letter That she would soon be here
This is a slave whose easy borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows  Out varlet from my sight
What means your grace
Who stocked my servant
Regan I have good hope Thou didst not know on ’t Who comes here
O Regan wilt thou take her by the hand
How have I offended
I set him there sir but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement
You
Did you
I pray you father being weak seem so
If till the expiration of your month You will return and sojourn with my sister Dismissing half your train come then to me
I am now from home and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment
Return to her and fifty men dismissed
Return with her
Why the hot blooded France that dowerless took Our youngest born I could as well be brought To knee his throne and squirelike pension beg To keep base life afoot
Return with her
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom
At your choice sir
Now I prithee daughter do not make me mad
I will not trouble thee my child
We’ll no more meet no more see one another
But yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter  Or rather a disease that’s in my flesh Which I must needs call mine
Thou art a boil A plague sore or embossèd carbuncle In my corrupted blood
But I’ll not chide thee
I do not bid the thunder bearer shoot Nor tell tales of thee to high judging Jove
Mend when thou canst
Be better at thy leisure
I can be patient
I can stay with Regan I and my hundred knights
Not altogether so sir
I looked not for you yet nor am provided For your fit welcome
Give ear sir to my sister
For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old and so  But she knows what she does
I dare avouch it sir
How in one house Should many people under two commands Hold amity
Tis hard almost impossible
Why might not you my lord receive attendance From those that she calls servants or from mine
Why not my lord
If then they chanced to slack you We could control them
If you will come to me  For now I spy a danger I entreat you To bring but five and twenty
To no more Will I give place or notice
I gave you all  And in good time you gave it
Made you my guardians my depositaries But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number
What must I come to you With five and twenty Regan
Said you so
And speak ’t again my lord
No more with me
Not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise
Hear me my lord
What need you five and twenty ten or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you
What need one
O reason not the need
Thou art a lady
If only to go warm were gorgeous Why nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st Which scarcely keeps thee warm
But for true need  You heavens give me that patience patience I need
You see me here you gods a poor old man As full of grief as age wretched in both
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts Against their father fool me not so much To bear it tamely
No you unnatural hags
I will have such revenges on you both That all the world shall I will do such things  What they are yet I know not but they shall be The terrors of the earth
You think I’ll weep
No I’ll not weep
I have full cause of weeping but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws Or ere I’ll weep O Fool I shall go mad
Let us withdraw
Twill be a storm
This house is little
The old man and his people Cannot be well bestowed
Tis his own blame
Hath put himself from rest And must needs taste his folly
So am I purposed
Where is my lord of Gloucester
Followed the old man forth
He is returned
Whither is he going
He calls to horse but will I know not whither
Tis best to give him way
He leads himself
For many miles about There’s scarce a bush
O sir to wilful men The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters
Shut up your doors
He is attended with a desperate train
And what they may incense him to being apt To have his ear abused wisdom bids fear
Shut up your doors my lord
Tis a wild night
My Regan counsels well
Come out o' th' storm
Who’s there besides foul weather
One minded like the weather most unquietly
I know you
Where’s the king
Contending with the fretful elements
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea Or swell the curlèd water 'bove the main That things might change or cease
Tears his white hair Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage Catch in their fury and make nothing of
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to and fro–conflicting wind and rain
This night wherein the cub drawn bear would couch The lion and the belly pinchèd wolf Keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs And bids what will take all
But who is with him
None but the fool who labors to outjest His heart struck injuries
Sir I do know you And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you
From France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom who already Wise in our negligence have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner
Now to you
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you
I will talk further with you
Give me your hand
Have you no more to say
Rage blow
You cataracts and hurricanoes spout Till you have drenched our steeples drowned the cocks
You sulfurous and thought executing fires Vaunt couriers of oak cleaving thunderbolts Singe my white head
And thou all shaking thunder Smite flat the thick rotundity o' th' world Crack nature’s molds all germens spill at once That make ingrateful man
O nuncle court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o' door
Good nuncle in and ask thy daughters blessing
Here’s a night pities neither wise man nor fool
Rumble thy bellyful
Spit fire
Spout rain
Nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters
I tax not you you elements with unkindness
Why then let fall Your horrible pleasure
Here I stand your slave  A poor infirm weak and despised old man
He that has a house to put ’s head in has a good headpiece
Answer my life my judgment Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least Nor are those empty hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness
Kent on thy life no more
Out of my sight
See better Lear and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye
Now by Apollo  Now by Apollo King Thou swear’st thy gods in vain
O vassal
Miscreant
Dear sir forbear
Hear me recreant
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths    in a glass
No I will be the pattern of all patience
I will say nothing
Who’s there
Marry here’s grace and a codpiece that’s a wise man and a fool
Let the great gods That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads Find out their enemies now
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest
Repose you there while I to this hard house  More harder than the stones whereof ’tis raised Which even but now demanding after you Denied me to come in return and force Their scanted courtesy
My wits begin to turn  Come on my boy
True my good boy Come bring us to this hovel
I’ll speak a prophecy ere I go
Then comes the time who lives to see ’t That going shall be used with feet
This prophecy Merlin shall make for I live before his time
Alack alack Edmund I like not this unnatural dealing
When I desire their leave that I might pity him they took from me the use of mine own house charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him entreat for him nor any way sustain him
Most savage and unnatural
Go to say you nothing
There’s a division betwixt the dukes
Tis dangerous to be spoken
I have locked the letter in my closet
These injuries the king now bears will be revenged home
There’s part of a power already footed
We must incline to the king
I will look him and privily relieve him
Go you and maintain talk with the duke that my charity be not of him perceived
If he ask for me I am ill and gone to bed
Though I die for it as no less is threatened me the king my old master must be relieved
There is some strange thing toward Edmund
Pray you be careful
This courtesy forbid thee shall the duke Instantly know and of that letter too
The younger rises when the old doth fall
Here is the place my lord
Good my lord enter
The tyranny of the open night’s too rough For nature to endure
Let me alone
Good my lord enter here
Wilt break my heart
I had rather break mine own
Good my lord enter
Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin
So ’tis to thee
But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt
Thou’dst shun a bear But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea Thou’dst meet the bear i' th' mouth
When the mind’s free The body’s delicate
The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there filial ingratitude
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to ’t
But I will punish home
No I will weep no more
In such a night To shut me out
Pour on I will endure
In such a night as this
O Regan Goneril Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all  Oh that way madness lies
Let me shun that
No more of that
Good my lord enter here
Prithee go in thyself
Seek thine own ease
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more
But I’ll go in
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just
Come not in here nuncle
Here’s a spirit
Help me help me
Give me thy hand
Who’s there
A spirit a spirit
He says his name’s Poor Tom
What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw
Come forth
Away
The foul fiend follows me
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind
Hum
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee
Didst thou give all to thy two daughters and art thou come to this
Bless thy five wits
Tom’s a cold
Oh do de do de do de
Bless thee from whirlwinds star blasting and taking
Do Poor Tom some charity whom the foul fiend vexes
There could I have him now and there and there again and there
What has his daughters brought him to this pass  Couldst thou save nothing
Wouldst thou give 'em all
Nay he reserved a blanket else we had been all shamed
Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o'er men’s faults light on thy daughters
He hath no daughters sir
Death traitor
Nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh
Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen
Take heed o' th' foul fiend
Obey thy parents keep thy word’s justice swear not commit not with man’s sworn spouse set not thy sweet heart on proud array
Tom’s a  cold
What hast thou been
Wine loved I deeply dice dearly and in woman outparamoured the Turk
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind says “Suum mun nonny” Dauphin my boy my boy cessez
Thou art the thing itself
Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare forked animal as thou art Off off you lendings
Unbutton here
Prithee nuncle be contented
Tis a naughty night to swim in
Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart a small spark all the rest on ’s body cold
Look here comes a walking fire
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet
He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock
And aroint thee witch aroint thee
How fares your grace
Who’s there
What is ’t you seek
What are you there
Your names
Peace Smulkin
Modo he’s called and Mahu
Poor Tom’s a cold
Go in with me
My duty cannot suffer To obey in all your daughters' hard commands
Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you Yet have I ventured to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready
First let me talk with this philosopher 
Away
By Jupiter This shall not be revoked
Why fare thee well King
Here’s France and Burgundy my noble lord
My lord of Burgundy
We first address towards you who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter
Let me ask you one word in private
Canst thou blame him
His daughters seek his death
Ah that good Kent  He said it would be thus poor banished man
Thou say’st the king grows mad
I’ll tell thee friend I am almost mad myself
I had a son Now outlawed from my blood
He sought my life But lately very late
I loved him friend  No father his son dearer
What a night’s this
O cry your mercy sir       Tom’s a cold
Keep thee warm
Come let’s in all
This way my lord
Come good Athenian
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house
How my lord I may be censured that nature thus gives way to loyalty something fears me to think of
I now perceive it was not altogether your brother’s evil disposition made him seek his death but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable badness in himself
How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just
Go with me to the duchess
If the matter of this paper be certain you have mighty business in hand
True or false it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester
I will lay trust upon thee and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love
Here is better than the open air
Take it thankfully
I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can
I will not be long from you
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience
The gods reward your kindness
A king a king
No he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him
To have a thousand with red burning spits Come hissing in upon 'em
The foul fiend bites my back
It shall be done
The foul fiend haunts Poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale
Hoppedance cries in Tom’s belly for two white herring
Croak not black angel
I have no food for thee
Sit you too
Let us deal justly
I here take my oath before this honorable assembly she kicked the poor king her father
Come hither mistress
Is your name Goneril
She cannot deny it
And here’s another whose warped looks proclaim What store her heart is made on
Stop her there
Arms arms sword fire corruption in the place
False justicer why hast thou let her ’scape
They’ll mar my counterfeiting
The little dogs and all Tray Blanch and Sweetheart see they bark at me
Tom will throw his head at them Avaunt you curs
Tooth that poisons if it bite Mastiff greyhound mongrel grim
Hound or spaniel brach or himBobtail tyke or trundle tail Tom will make them weep and wail
For with throwing thus my headDogs leap the hatch and all are fled
Be thy mouth or black or whiteDo de de de
Cessez
Come march to wakes and fairs and market towns
Poor Tom thy horn is dry
Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts
Now good my lord lie here and rest awhile
Make no noise make no noise
Draw the curtains so so so
We’ll go to supper i' th' morning
So so so
And I’ll go to bed at noon
Here sir but trouble him not
His wits are gone
Good friend I prithee take him in thy arms
There is a litter ready
Come help to bear thy master
Come come away
When we our betters see bearing our woes We scarcely think our miseries our foes
Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind Leaving free things and happy shows behind
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship
Tom away
What will hap more tonight safe ’scape the king
Lurk lurk
Hang him instantly
Pluck out his eyes
Leave him to my displeasure Edmund keep you our sister company
The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding
Advise the duke where you are going to a most festinate preparation
We are bound to the like
Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us Farewell dear sister
How now
Where’s the king
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence
Some five or six and thirty of his knights Hot questrists after him met him at gate Who with some other of the lord’s dependants Are gone with him towards Dover where they boast To have well armèd friends
Get horses for your mistress
Farewell sweet lord and sister
Edmund farewell
Go seek the traitor Gloucester
Pinion him like a thief bring him before us
Ingrateful fox ’tis he
Bind fast his corky arms
What mean your graces
Good my friends consider You are my guests
Do me no foul play friends
Bind him I say
Most royal majesty I crave no more than hath your highness offered
Nor will you tender less
Sir there she stands
I know no answer
Sir will you with those infirmities she owes  Unfriended new adopted to our hate Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath  Take her or leave her
Then leave her sir for by the power that made me I tell you all her wealth
Hard hard O filthy traitor
Unmerciful lady as you are I’m none
To this chair bind him Villain thou shalt find  By the kind gods ’tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard
So white and such a traitor
Naughty lady These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken and accuse thee
I am your host
With robbers' hands my hospitable favors You should not ruffle thus
What will you do
Come sir what letters had you late from France
Be simple answered for we know the truth
And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king
Speak
I have a letter guessingly set down Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart And not from one opposed
Cunning
And false
Where hast thou sent the king
To Dover
Wherefore to Dover
Wast thou not charged at peril  Wherefore to Dover Let him first answer that
I am tied to th' stake and I must stand the course
Wherefore to Dover sir
Because I would not see thy cruèl nails Pluck out his poor old eyes nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs
The sea with such a storm as his bare head In hell black night endured would have buoyed up And quenched the stellèd fires
Yet poor old heart he holp the heavens to rain
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time Thou shouldst have said “Good porter turn the key” All cruèls else subscribed
But I shall see The wingèd vengeance overtake such children
See” ’t shalt thou never Fellows hold the chair  Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot
He that will think to live till he be old Give me some help
O cruel
O you gods
One side will mock another th' other too
But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold
How now you dog
If you did wear a beard upon your chin I’d shake it on this quarrel
What do you mean
Nay then come on and take the chance of anger
Oh I am slain My lord you have one eye left To see some mischief on him
Oh
Where is thy luster now
Where’s my son Edmund
Out treacherous villain
Thou call’st on him that hates thee
It was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us Who is too good to pity thee
O my follies
Then Edgar was abused
Go thrust him out at gates and let him smell His way to Dover
I have received a hurt
Follow me lady  Turn out that eyeless villain
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill Regan I bleed apace
Untimely comes this hurt
Give me your arm
I’ll never care what wickedness I do If this man come to good
If she live long And in the end meet the old course of death Women will all turn monsters
Let’s follow the old earl and get the Bedlam To lead him where he would
His roguish madness Allows itself to any thing
Go thou
I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face
Now heaven help him
The lamentable change is from the best The worst returns to laughter
Welcome then Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace
But who comes here
My father poorly led
World world O world
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee Life would not yield to age
I have been your tenant and your father’s tenant these fourscore years
Away get thee away
Good friend be gone
Alack sir you cannot see your way
I have no way and therefore want no eyes
I stumbled when I saw
Full oft ’tis seen Our means secure us and our mere defects Prove our commodities
O dear son Edgar The food of thy abusèd father’s wrath Might I but live to see thee in my touch I’d say I had eyes again
How now
Who’s there
Madman and beggar too
My son Came then into my mind and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him
I have heard more since
Is that the naked fellow
Ay my lord
Alack sir he is mad
Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind
Do as I bid thee
Or rather do thy pleasure
Sirrah naked fellow  Poor Tom’s a cold
Come hither fellow
Know’st thou the way to Dover
Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits
So bless thee master
Ay master
There is a cliff whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confinèd deep
Bring me but to the very brim of it And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me
From that place I shall no leading need
Give me thy arm
Poor Tom shall lead thee
Welcome my lord
I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way
Now where’s your master
Sure her offense Must be of such unnatural degree That monsters it (or your fore vouched affection Fall into taint) which to believe of her Must be a faith that reason without miracle Could never plant in me
Go to go to
Better thou Hadst not been born than not t' have pleased me better
Is it no more but this a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do My lord of Burgundy What say you to the lady
Love’s not love When it is mingled with regards that stands Aloof from th' entire point
Will you have her
She is herself a dowry
Yours in the ranks of death
My most dear Gloucester
Oh the difference of man and man
To thee a woman’s services are due
My fool usurps my body
Madam here comes my lord
I have been worth the whistle
O Goneril You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face
I fear your disposition
That nature which contemns its origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself
She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap perforce must wither And come to deadly use
No more
The text is foolish
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile
Filths savor but themselves
What have you done
Tigers not daughters what have you performed
Could my good brother suffer you to do it  A man a prince by him so benefited
Where’s thy drum
Thou changèd and self covered thing for shame
Bemonster not thy feature
Were ’t my fitness To let these hands obey my blood They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones
Howe'er thou art a fiend A woman’s shape doth shield thee
Marry your manhood mew
What news
Gloucester’s eyes
But oh poor Gloucester  Lost he his other eye
Both both my lord  This letter madam craves a speedy answer
Tis from your sister
One way I like this well
But being widow and my Gloucester with her May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life
Come with my lady hither
He is not here
No my good lord
Ay my good lord
Twas he informed against him And quit the house on purpose that their punishment Might have the freer course
Tell me what more thou know’st
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason
Something he left imperfect in the state which since his coming forth is thought of which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary
Who hath he left behind him general
The Marshal of France Monsieur la Far
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief
Ay sir
It seemed she was a queen Over her passion who most rebel like Sought to be king o'er her
O then it moved her
In brief Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved If all could so become it
Made she no verbal question
Faith once or twice she heaved the name of “father” Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart Cried “Sisters sisters
Shame of ladies sisters
Kent father sisters
What i' th' storm i' th' night
Let pity not be believed” There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes And clamor moistened
Then away she started To deal with grief alone
You spoke not with her since
No
Was this before the king returned
No since
Why good sir
A sovereign shame so elbows him
His own unkindness That stripped her from his benediction turned her To foreign casualties gave her dear rights To his dog hearted daughters
These things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia
Alack poor gentleman
Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not
Tis so
They are afoot
Well sir I’ll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him
Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile
When I am known aright you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance
I pray you go Along with me
Alack ’tis he
Why he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea singing aloud Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow weeds With burdocks hemlock nettles cuckoo flowers Darnel and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn A century send forth
Search every acre in the high grown field And bring him to our eye
There is means madam
Our foster nurse of nature is repose The which he lacks that to provoke in him Are many simples operative whose power Will close the eye of anguish
All blessed secrets All you unpublished virtues of the earth Spring with my tears
Be aidant and remediate In the good man’s distress
Seek seek for him Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it
News madam
The British powers are marching hitherward
Tis known before
Our preparation stands In expectation of them
O dear father It is thy business that I go about
Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied
No blown ambition doth our arms incite But love dear love and our aged father’s right
Soon may I hear and see him
But are my brother’s powers set forth
Ay madam
Himself in person there
Madam with much ado
Your sister is the better soldier
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home
No madam
What might import my sister’s letter to him
I know not lady
Faith he is posted hence on serious matter
It was great ignorance Gloucester’s eyes being out To let him live
Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us
Edmund I think is gone In pity of his misery to dispatch His nighted life moreover to descry The strength o' th' enemy
I must needs after him madam with my letter
Our troops set forth tomorrow
Stay with us
The ways are dangerous
Peace be with Burgundy
Since that respects and fortunes are his love I shall not be his wife
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unprized precious maid of me  Bid them farewell Cordelia though unkind
Let her be thine for we Have no such daughter nor shall ever see That face of hers again
Bid farewell to your sisters
I may not madam
My lady charged my duty in this business
Why should she write to Edmund
Belike Some things I know not what
Madam I had rather  I know your lady does not love her husband
I am sure of that
And at her late being here She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks To noble Edmund
I know you are of her bosom
I madam
I speak in understanding
Therefore I do advise you take this note
My lord is dead
Edmund and I have talked And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady’s
You may gather more
Fare thee well
When shall we come to th' top of that same hill
Methinks the ground is even
Horrible steep
No truly
Why then your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes' anguish
So may it be indeed
Methinks thy voice is altered and thou speak’st In better phrase and matter than thou didst
You’re much deceived
In nothing am I changed But in my garments
Methinks you’re better spoken
Come on sir
Here’s the place
Stand still
How fearful And dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles
Halfway down Hangs one that gathers samphire dreadful trade
And yon tall anchoring bark
The murmuring surge That on th' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes Cannot be heard so high
Set me where you stand
Give me your hand
You are now within a foot Of th' extreme verge
Let go my hand
Now fare you well good sir
With all my heart
O you mighty godsThis world I do renounce and in your sights Shake patiently my great affliction off
Gone sir
Farewell
Away and let me die
Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell
Thy life’s a miracle
Speak yet again
But have I fall'n or no
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn
Look up a height
The shrill gorged lark so far Cannot be seen or heard
Do but look up
Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage And frustrate his proud will
Give me your arm
Up so
How is ’t
Feel you your legs
You stand
Too well too well
This is above all strangeness
Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that Which parted from you
A poor unfortunate beggar
As I stood here below methought his eyes Were two full moons
He had a thousand noses Horns whelked and waved like the enragèd sea
It was some fiend
I do remember now
Henceforth I’ll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself “Enough enough” and die
That thing you speak of I took it for a man
Bear free and patient thoughts
But who comes here
I am the king himself
Look look a mouse
peace this piece of toasted cheese will do ’t
O well flown bird
I' th' clout i' th' clout
Sweet marjoram
Pass
I know that voice
Ha
Goneril with a white beard
Go to they are not men o' their words
They told me I was everything
The trick of that voice I do well remember
Is ’t not the king
Ay every inch a king
I pardon that man’s life
What was thy cause
Adultery
Thou shalt not die
Die for adultery
No
The wren goes to ’t and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight
Let copulation thrive for Gloucester’s bastard son Was kinder to his father than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets
To ’t luxury pell mell for I lack soldiers
Down from the waist they are centaurs though women all above
There’s hell there’s darkness there’s the sulfurous pit  burning scalding stench consumption
Fie fie fie pah pah Give me an ounce of civet good apothecary to sweeten my imagination
There’s money for thee
O let me kiss that hand
Let me wipe it first
I remember thine eyes well enough
Dost thou squiny at me
Read thou this challenge
Read
What with the case of eyes
Oh ho are you there with me
No eyes in your head nor no money in your purse
What art mad
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes
Look with thine ears
See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief
Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar
Ay sir
And the creature run from the cur
There thou mightst behold the great image of authority a dog’s obeyed in office
Thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand
Why dost thou lash that whore
Thou hotly lust’st to use her in that kindFor which thou whipp’st her
The usurer hangs the cozener
None does offend none I say none
I’ll able 'em
Take that of me my friend who have the powerTo seal th' accuser’s lips
Harder harder
So
If thou wilt weep my fortunes take my eyes
I know thee well enough
Thy name is Gloucester
Thou must be patient
We came crying hither
Thou know’st the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry
I will preach to thee
Mark me
Alack alack the day
When we are born we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools
This a good block
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt
I’ll put ’t in proof
And when I have stol'n upon these sons in law Then kill kill kill kill kill kill
What a prisoner
I am even The natural fool of fortune
Use me well
You shall have ransom
Let me have surgeons
I am cut to th' brains
You shall have anything
No seconds
All myself
Why this would make a man a man of salt To use his eyes for garden water pots Ay and laying autumn’s dust
Good sir 
I will die bravely like a smug bridegroom
What I will be jovial
Come come
I am a king my masters know you that
You are a royal one and we obey you
Then there’s life in ’t
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch Past speaking of in a king
Hail gentle sir
Sir speed you
What’s your will
Do you hear aught sir of a battle toward
Most sure and vulgar
Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound
But by your favor how near’s the other army
Near and on speedy foot
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought
I thank you sir
That’s all
I know you what you are And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named
But yet alas stood I within his grace I would prefer him to a better place
So farewell to you both
Prescribe not us our duty
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides Who covers faults at last with shame derides
Well may you prosper
Come my fair Cordelia
Sister it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both
I think our father will hence tonight
That’s most certain and with you
Next month with us
You see how full of changes his age is
He always loved our sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly
Though that the queen on special cause is here Her army is moved on
I thank you sir
You ever gentle gods take my breath from me
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please
Well pray you father
Now good sir what are you
A most poor man made tame to fortune’s blows Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows Am pregnant to good pity
Hearty thanks
The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot and boot
Most happy
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh To raise my fortunes
Thou old unhappy traitor Briefly thyself remember
Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to ’t
Wherefore bold peasant Darest thou support a published traitor
Hence Lest that th' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee
Let go his arm
Chill not let go zir without vurther 'casion
Let go slave or thou diest
Chill pick your teeth zir
Come no matter vor your foins
If ever thou wilt thrive bury my body
I know thee well a serviceable villain As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire
What is he dead
Let’s see these pockets
The letters that he speaks ofMay be my friends
He’s dead
I am only sorryHe had no other death’s man
Let us see
Leave gentle wax and manners blame us not
Their papers is more lawful
Let our reciprocal vows be remembered
The king is mad
Better I were distract  So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves
Give me your hand
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum
Come father I’ll bestow you with a friend
O thou good Kent how shall I live and work To match thy goodness
My life will be too short And every measure fail me
To be acknowledged madam is o'erpaid
All my reports go with the modest truth Nor more nor clipped but so
Be better suited
I prithee put them off
My boon I make it that you know me not Till time and I think meet
Then be ’t so my good lord  How does the king
Madam sleeps still
So please your majesty That we may wake the king
He hath slept long
Is he arrayed
Ay madam
Be by good madam when we do awake him
I doubt not of his temperance
Very well
Please you draw near Louder the music there
Kind and dear princess
Had you not been their father these white flakes Did challenge pity of them
And wast thou fain poor father To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn In short and musty straw
Alack alack
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all He wakes
Speak to him
Madam do you
Tis fittest
How does my royal lord
How fares your majesty
You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave
Thou art a soul in bliss but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead
Sir do you know me
You are a spirit I know
Where did you die
Let him alone awhile
Where have I been
Where am I
Fair daylight
I am mightily abused
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus
I know not what to say
I will not swear these are my hands
Let’s see
I feel this pinprick
Would I were assured Of my condition
Pray do not mock me
I am a very foolish fond old man Fourscore and upward not an hour more nor less
And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind
Methinks I should know you and know this man
Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night
Do not laugh at me For as I am a man I think this lady To be my child Cordelia
And so I am I am
Be your tears wet
Yes faith
I pray weep not
If you have poison for me I will drink it
You have some cause they have not
No cause no cause
Am I in France
In your own kingdom sir
Do not abuse me
Be comforted good madam
The great rage You see is killed in him
And yet it is danger To make him even o'er the time he has lost
Desire him to go in
Trouble him no more Till further settling
Will ’t please your highness walk
You must bear with me
Pray you now forget and forgive
I am old and foolish
Holds it true sir that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain
Most certain sir
Who is conductor of his people
As ’tis said the bastard son of Gloucester
They say Edgar his banished son is with the Earl of Kent in Germany
Report is changeable
Tis time to look about
The powers of the kingdom approach apace
The arbitrament is like to be bloody
Fare you well sir
Tis to be doubted madam
Now sweet lord You know the goodness I intend upon you
Tell me but truly but then speak the truth  Do you not love my sister
In honored love
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosomed with her as far as we call hers
No by mine honor madam
Tis the infirmity of his age
Yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash
Then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long engrafted condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent’s banishment
There is further compliment of leave taking between France and him
Pray you let’s sit together
If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears this last surrender of his will but offend us
We shall further think on ’t
We must do something and i' th' heat
I never shall endure her
Dear my lord Be not familiar with her
Fear me not  She and the duke her husband
Sir you speak nobly
Why is this reasoned
Let’s then determine with the ancient of war On our proceedings
I shall attend you presently at your tent
Sister you’ll go with us
No
Tis most convenient
Pray you go with us
Stay till I have read the letter
I was forbid it
When time shall serve let but the herald cry And I’ll appear again
Why fare thee well
I will o'erlook thy paper
Draw up your powers
We will greet the time
Which of them shall I take
Both
One
Or neither
Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive
To take the widow Exasperates makes mad her sister Goneril And hardly shall I carry out my side Her husband being alive
Now then we’ll use His countenance for the battle which being done Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off
If ever I return to you again I’ll bring you comfort
Grace go with you sir
Away old man
Give me thy hand
Away
King Lear hath lost he and his daughter ta'en
Give me thy hand
Come on
No further sir
Come on
And that’s true too
Some officers take them away
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them
No no no no
Come let’s away to prison
We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage
When thou dost ask me blessing I’ll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness
And we’ll wear out In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon
Take them away
Upon such sacrifices my Cordelia The gods themselves throw incense
Have I caught thee
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes
Wipe thine eyes
The good years shall devour them flesh and fell Ere they shall make us weep
We’ll see 'em starve first
Come
Come hither captain
Hark
I’ll do ’t my lord
About it and write “happy” when thou’st done
Mark I say instantly and carry it so As I have set it down
I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats
If it be man’s work I’ll do ’t
I do require them of you so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine
With him I sent the queen My reason all the same and they are ready Tomorrow or at further space t' appear Where you shall hold your session
The question of Cordelia and her father Requires a fitter place
I hold you but a subject of this war Not as a brother
That’s as we list to grace him
Not so hot
In his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your addition
That were the most if he should   husband you
That eye that told you so looked but asquint
Mean you to enjoy him then
Nor in thine lord
Half blooded fellow yes
Stay yet
An interlude
Thou art armed Gloucester
Let the trumpet sound
Sick oh sick
My sickness grows upon me
She is not well
Convey her to my tent
Come hither herald Let the trumpet sound  And read out this
Sound trumpet
Again
Again
What are you
Well then Legitimate Edgar I must have your land
Now gods stand up for bastards
Kent banished thus
All this done Upon the gad Edmund how now
What news
O know my name is lost
Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope withal
Which is that adversary
What’s he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester
Himself
What sayst thou to him
Behold it is the privilege of mine honors My oath and my profession
In wisdom I should ask thy name
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head With the hell hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart 
This is practice Gloucester
By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite
The laws are mine not thine
Who can arraign me for ’t
Most monstrous oh
Ask me not what I know
Go after her
She’s desperate
What you have charged me with that have I done  And more much more
The time will bring it out
Tis past and so am I
I am no less in blood than thou art Edmund
If more the more thou’st wronged me
My name is Edgar and thy father’s son
The gods are just and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us
Thou’st spoken right
Tis true
I must embrace thee
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I Did hate thee or thy father
Worthy prince I know ’t
Where have you hid yourself
How have you known the miseries of your father
List a brief tale And when ’tis told oh that my heart would burst
The bloody proclamation to escape That followed me so near O our lives' sweetness
And in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings Their precious stones new lost became his guide Led him begged for him saved him from despair
Never O fault revealed myself unto him Until some half hour past when I was armed
But his flawed heart  Alack too weak the conflict to support  'Twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief Burst smilingly
This speech of yours hath moved me And shall perchance do good
But speak you on
You look as you had something more to say
If there be more more woeful hold it in
For I am almost ready to dissolve Hearing of this
This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow but another To amplify too much would make much more And top extremity
Twice then the trumpets sounded And there I left him tranced
But who was this
Kent sir the banished Kent who in disguise Followed his enemy king and did him service Improper for a slave
Help help O help
What kind of help
Speak man
What means that bloody knife
Tis hot it smokes
It came even from the heart of oh she’s dead
Who dead
Speak man
Your lady sir your lady
And her sister By her is poisoned
She confesses it
I was contracted to them both
All three Now marry in an instant
Here comes Kent
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall
It did always seem so to us
But now in the division of the kingdom it appears not which of the dukes he values most for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety
His breeding sir hath been at my charge
I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it
Do you smell a fault
I cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it being so proper
But I have sir a son by order of law some year older than this who yet is no dearer in my account
Oh is this he
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night
Is he not here
Great thing of us forgot  Speak Edmund where’s the king
And where’s Cordelia  Seest thou this object Kent
Alack why thus
Yet Edmund was beloved
The one the other poisoned for my sake And after slew herself
Even so Cover their faces
I pant for life
Some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature
Quickly send  Be brief in it to th' castle for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia
Nay send in time
Run run O run
To who my lord Who hath the office
Send Thy token of reprieve
Well thought on
Take my sword
The captain  Give it the captain
Haste thee for thy life
He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison and To lay the blame upon her own despair That she fordid herself
The gods defend her hear him hence awhile
Howl howl howl howl
Oh you are men of stones
Had I your tongues and eyes I’d use them so That heaven’s vault should crack
She’s gone forever
I know when one is dead and when one lives
She’s dead as earth
Lend me a looking glass
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone Why then she lives
Or image of that horror
Fall and cease
This feather stirs
She lives
If it be so It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt
O my good master
Prithee away
Tis noble Kent your friend
A plague upon you murderers traitors all
I might have saved her
Now she’s gone for ever  Cordelia Cordelia stay a little
Ha
Tis true my lords he did
Did I not fellow
I am old now And these same crosses spoil me
This a dull sight
Are you not Kent
The same
Your servant Kent
Where is your servant Caius
He’s a good fellow I can tell you that
He’s dead and rotten
No my good lord
I am the very man  I’ll see that straight
That from your first of difference and decay Have followed your sad steps
You’re welcome hither
Nor no man else
All’s cheerless dark and deadly
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves And desperately are dead
Ay so I think
He knows not what he says and vain it is That we present us to him
Edmund is dead my lord
For us we will resign During the life of this old majesty To him our absolute power
He faints My lord my lord
Vex not his ghost
O let him pass
Oh he is gone indeed
The wonder is he hath endured so long
Bear them from hence
Our present business Is to general woe
Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter
I know no news my lord
What paper were you reading
Nothing my lord
No
What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket
The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself
I beseech you sir pardon me
It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er read
Give me the letter sir
I shall offend either to detain or give it
The contents as in part I understand them are to blame
I hope for my brother’s justification he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue
I have a journey sir shortly to go
My master calls me
I must not say no
The weight of this sad time we must obey
Speak what we feel not what we ought to say
Come to me that of this I may speak more
If our father would sleep till I waked him you should enjoy half his revenue forever and live the beloved of your brother     Edgar”Hum conspiracy
Had he a hand to write this a heart and brain to breed it in
When came this to you
Who brought it
It was not brought me my lord
There’s the cunning of it
I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet
You know the character to be your brother’s
If the matter were good my lord I durst swear it were his
But in respect of that I would fain think it were not
It is his
It is his hand my lord but I hope his heart is not in the contents
Has he never before sounded you in this business
Never my lord
But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age and fathers declined the father should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue
O villain villain
His very opinion in the letter
Abhorred villain
Go sirrah seek him
I’ll apprehend him
Abominable villain
Where is he
I do not well know my lord
I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath wrote this to feel my affection to your honor and to no other pretense of danger
Think you so
He cannot be such a monster  Nor is not sure
To his father that so tenderly and entirely loves him
Heaven and earth
Edmund seek him out wind me into him I pray you
I will seek him sir presently convey the business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal
These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us
Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects
Love cools friendship falls off brothers divide in cities
mutinies in countries discord in palaces treason and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father
This villain of mine comes under the prediction there’s son against father
The king falls from bias of nature there’s father against child
We have seen the best of our time
Machinations hollowness treachery and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves
Find out this villain Edmund
It shall lose thee nothing
Do it carefully And the noble and true hearted Kent banished his offense honesty
Tis strange strange
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeit of our own behavior we make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if we were villains by necessity fools by heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and treachers by spherical predominance drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on
My father compounded with my mother under the dragon’s tail and my nativity was under Ursa Major so that it follows I am rough and lecherous
Fut I should have been that I am had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing
Fa sol la mi
How now brother Edmund
What serious contemplation are you in
How long have you been a sectary astronomical
Come come
When saw you my father last
Why the night gone by
Spake you with him
Ay two hours together
Parted you in good terms
Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance
None at all
Some villain hath done me wrong
That’s my fear
I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower
And as I say retire with me to my lodging from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak
Pray ye go
There’s my key
If you do stir abroad go armed
Armed brother
Brother I advise you to the best
Go armed
Pray you away
Shall I hear from you anon
I do serve you in this business
A credulous father and a brother noble  Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy
I see the business
Let me if not by birth have lands by wit
All with me’s meet that I can fashion fit
Did my father strike my gentleman For chiding of his fool
Ay madam
By day and night he wrongs me
Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds
I’ll not endure it
His knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us On every trifle
When he returns from hunting I will not speak with him
Say I am sick
If you come slack of former services You shall do well
The fault of it I’ll answer
He’s coming madam
I hear him
Put on what weary negligence you please You and your fellow servants
If he distaste it let him to our sister Whose mind and mine I know in that are one Not to be overruled
Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away
Now by my life Old fools are babes again and must be used With checks as flatteries when they are seen abused
Remember what I have said
Very well madam
And let his knights have colder looks among you
What grows of it no matter
Advise your fellows so
I would breed from hence occasions and I shall That I may speak
I’ll write straight to my sister To hold my very course
Go prepare for dinner
If but as well I other accents borrow That can my speech diffuse my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness
Now banished Kent If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned So may it come thy master whom thou lovest Shall find thee full of labors
Let me not stay a jot for dinner
Go get it ready
A man sir
What dost thou profess
What wouldst thou with us
What art thou
A very honest hearted fellow and as poor as the king
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king thou'rt poor enough
What wouldst thou
Service
Who wouldst thou serve
You
Dost thou know me fellow
Authority
What services canst thou do
I can keep honest counsel ride run mar a curious tale in telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly
That which ordinary men are fit for I am qualified in
And the best of me is diligence
How old art thou
Not so young sir to love a woman for singing nor so old to dote on her for anything
I have years on my back forty  eight
Follow me
Thou shalt serve me
Where’s my knave my fool Go you and call my fool hither
No my lord
My services to your lordship
I must love you and sue to know you better
Sir I shall study deserving
He hath been out nine years and away he shall again
The king is coming
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy Gloucester
I shall my lord
You you sirrah where’s my daughter
So please you  What says the fellow there
Call the clotpoll back
Where’s my fool ho
I think the world’s asleep
How now
Where’s that mongrel
He says my lord your daughter is not well
Why came not the slave back to me when I called him
Sir he answered me in the roundest manner he would not
He would not
My lord I know not what the matter is but to my judgment your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont
There’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also and your daughter
Ha
Sayest thou so
I beseech you pardon me my lord if I be mistaken for my duty cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged
Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception
I have perceived a most faint neglect of late which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretense and purpose of unkindness
I will look further into ’t
But where’s my fool
I have not seen him this two days
Since my young lady’s going into France sir the fool hath much pined away
No more of that
I have noted it well
Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her
Go you call hither my fool
O you sir you come you hither sir
Who am I sir
You slave you cur
I am none of these my lord
I beseech your pardon
I’ll not be strucken my lord
Now my friendly knave I thank thee
Let me hire him too Here’s my coxcomb
How now my pretty knave
How dost thou
Why Fool
Why
For taking one’s part that’s out of favor
Nay an thou canst not smile as the wind sits thou'lt catch cold shortly
There take my coxcomb
Why this fellow has banished two on ’s daughters and did the third a blessing against his will
If thou follow him thou must needs wear my coxcomb How now nuncle
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters
Why my boy
If I gave them all my living I’d keep my coxcombs myself
There’s mine
Beg another of thy daughters
Take heed sirrah the whip
A pestilent gall to me
Sirrah I’ll teach thee a speech
Do
Mark it nuncle
Have more than thou showest Speak less than thou knowest Lend less than thou owest Ride more than thou goest Learn more than thou trowest Set less than thou throwest Leave thy drink and thy whore And keep in a door And thou shalt have more Than two tens to a score
This is nothing Fool
Then ’tis like the breath of an unfee’d lawyer
Why no boy
Nothing can be made out of nothing
A bitter fool
Dost thou know the difference my boy between a bitter fool and a sweet fool
No lad
Teach me
That lord that counseled thee To give away thy land Come place him here by me
Do thou for him stand
The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear  The one in motley here The other found out there
Dost thou call me fool boy
All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with
This is not altogether fool my lord
No faith lords and great men will not let me
What two crowns shall they be
Why after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the meat the two crowns of the egg
If I speak like myself in this let him be whipped that first finds it so
When were you wont to be so full of songs sirrah
I have used it nuncle ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers
For when thou gavest them the rod and put’st down thine own breechesPrithee nuncle keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie
I would fain learn to lie
An you lie sirrah we’ll have you whipped
I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are
They’ll have me whipped for speaking true thou'lt have me whipped for lying and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace
I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool
And yet I would not be thee nuncle
Here comes one o' the parings
How now daughter
What makes that frontlet on
Methinks you are too much of late i' th' frown
He that keeps nor crust nor crumbWeary of all shall want some
But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth In rank and not to be endurèd riots
Which else were shame that then necessity Will call discreet proceeding
For you know nuncle The hedge sparrow fed the cuckoo so long That it’s had it head bit off by it young
So out went the candle and we were left darkling
Are you our daughter
Does any here know me
Why this is not Lear
Where are his eyes
Sure ’tis not so
Who is it that can tell me who I am
Lear’s shadow
Which they will make an obedient father
This admiration sir is much o' th' savor Of other your new pranks
I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright
As you are old and reverend should be wise
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires Men so disordered so debauched and bold That this our court infected with their manners Shows like a riotous inn
Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a graced palace
The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy
Darkness and devils
Saddle my horses
Call my train together  Degenerate bastard I’ll not trouble thee
Yet have I left a daughter
You strike my people and your disordered rabble Make servants of their betters
Woe that too late repents  Is it your will
Ingratitude thou marble hearted fiend More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child Than the sea monster
Pray sir be patient
It may be so my lord
Hear Nature hear dear goddess hear
Dry up in her the organs of increase And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honor her
To thine and Albany’s issue Be this perpetual What says our second daughter Our dearest Regan wife of Cornwall
Speak
Now gods that we adore whereof comes this
Thou shalt find That I’ll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever
Thou shalt I warrant thee
Do you mark that my lord
I cannot be so partial Goneril To the great love I bear you       Pray you content
Come sire no more What Oswald ho
A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter If my cap would buy a halter
So the fool follows after
This man hath had good counsel a hundred knights
Well you may fear too far
Safer than trust too far
Let me still take away the harms I fear Not fear still to be taken
I know his heart
What he hath uttered I have writ my sister
If she sustain him and his hundred knights When I have showed th' unfitness  Here madam
How now Oswald
What have you writ that letter to my sister
Ay madam
Take you some company and away to horse
Inform her full of my particular fear And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more
Get you gone And hasten your return
Striving to better oft we mar what’s well
Nay then  Well well th' event
I will not sleep my lord till I have delivered your letter
If a man’s brains were in ’s heels were ’t not in danger of kibes
Ay boy
Ha ha ha
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly
For though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an apple yet I can tell what I can tell
Why what canst thou tell my boy
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab
Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i' th' middle on ’s face
No
Why to keep one’s eyes of either side ’s nose that what a man cannot smell out he may spy into
I did her wrong  Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell
No
Nor I neither
But I can tell why a snail has a house
Why
Why to put ’s head in not to give it away to his daughters and leave his horns without a case
I will forget my nature
So kind a father Be my horses ready
Thy asses are gone about 'em
The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason
Because they are not eight
Yes indeed
Thou wouldst make a good fool
To take ’t again perforce  Monster ingratitude
If thou wert my fool nuncle I’d have thee beaten for being old before thy time
How’s that
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise
O let me not be mad not mad sweet heaven
Keep me in temper
I would not be mad
Ready my lord
Come boy
Save thee Curan
And you sir
I have been with your father and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be here with him this night
How comes that
Nay I know not
Have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt the two Dukes of Cornwall and Albany
Not a word
You may do then in time
Fare you well sir
The duke be here tonight
This weaves itself perforce into my business
Briefness and fortune work  Brother a word
Descend brother I say
My father watches
O sir fly this place
Intelligence is given where you are hid
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall aught
He’s coming hither now i' th' night i' th' haste And Regan with him
Advise yourself
I hear my father coming
Pardon me
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
Now quit you well        Torches torches
Now Edmund where’s the villain
Look sir I bleed
Where is the villain Edmund
Fled this way sir when by no means he could  Pursue him ho
Go after
By no means” what
Sir in fine Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose in fell motion With his preparèd sword he charges home My unprovided body latched mine arm
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits Bold in the quarrel’s right roused to the encounter Or whether ghasted by the noise I made Full suddenly he fled
Let him fly far
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught
The noble duke my master My worthy arch and patron comes tonight
And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness' love
Speak
Nothing my lord
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing will come of nothing
Speak again
Unhappy that I am I cannot heave My heart into my mouth
I love your majesty According to my bond no more nor less
How how Cordelia
Mend your speech a little Lest you may mar your fortunes
He that conceals him death
He replied “Thou unpossessing bastard
Dost thou think If I would stand against thee would the reposal Of any trust virtue or worth in thee Make thy words faithed
No
What I should deny  As this I would ay though thou didst produce My very character I’d turn it all To thy suggestion plot and damnèd practice
And thou must make a dullard of the world If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spirits To make thee seek it”    O strange and fastened villain
Would he deny his letter said he
I never got him  Hark the duke’s trumpets
I know not why he comes
All ports I’ll bar
The villain shall not ’scape
The duke must grant me that
How now my noble friend
Since I came hither Which I can call but now I have heard strange news
How dost my lord
O madam my old heart is cracked it’s cracked
O lady lady shame would have it hid
Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father
I know not madam
Tis too bad too bad
Yes madam he was of that consort
No marvel then though he were ill affected
Tis they have put him on the old man’s death To have th' expense and spoil of his revenues
I have this present evening from my sister Been well informed of them and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house I’ll not be there
Nor I assure thee Regan  Edmund I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office
It was my duty sir
He did bewray his practice and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him
Is he pursued
Ay my good lord
If he be taken he shall never more Be feared of doing harm
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need
I shall serve you sir Truly however else
You know not why we came to visit you  Thus out of season threading dark eyed night
The several messengers From hence attend dispatch
Our good old friend Lay comforts to your bosom and bestow Your needful counsel to our business Which craves the instant use
I serve you madam
Your graces are right welcome
Good dawning to thee friend
Art of this house
Ay
Where may we set our horses
I' th' mire
Prithee if thou lovest me tell me
I love thee not
Why then I care not for thee
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold I would make thee care for me
Why dost thou use me thus
I know thee not
Fellow I know thee
What dost thou know me for
Why what a monstrous fellow art thou thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee
What a brazen faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me
Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king
Draw you rogue for though it be night yet the moon shines
I’ll make a sop o' th' moonshine of you
Away
I have nothing to do with thee
Draw you rascal
You come with letters against the king and take Vanity the puppet’s part against the royalty of her father
Draw you rogue or I’ll so carbonado your shanks
Draw you rascal
Come your ways
Help ho
Murder
Help
Stand you neat slave strike
Help ho
Murder murder
Macbeth
Then stand with us
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day
Now spurs the lated traveler apace To gain the timely inn and near approaches The subject of our watch
Then ’tis he the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i' th' court
Tis he
Stand to ’t
It will be rain tonight
Let it come down
O treachery
Fly good Fleance fly fly fly
Thou may ’st revenge  O slave
Who did strike out the light
Was ’t not the way
There’s but one down
The son is fled
We have lost best half of our affair
Well let’s away and say how much is done
At first And last the hearty welcome
Thanks to your majesty
Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host
Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends For my heart speaks they are welcome
See they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks
Both sides are even
Here I’ll sit i' th' midst
Be large in mirth
Anon we’ll drink a measure The table round
Tis Banquo’s then
My lord his throat is cut
That I did for him
Thou art the best o' th' cutthroats Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance
If thou didst it thou art the nonpareil
Most royal sir Fleance is ’scaped
Then comes my fit again
I had else been perfect Whole as the marble founded as the rock As broad and general as the casing air
Ay my good lord
Safe in a ditch he bides With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head The least a death to nature
Thanks for that
There the grown serpent lies
The worm that’s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed No teeth for th' present
Get thee gone
Tomorrow We’ll hear ourselves again
My royal lord You do not give the cheer
To feed were best at home From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony Meeting were bare without it
Where hast thou been sister
Killing swine
Sister where thou
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap And munched and munched and munched
Give me”      quoth I
Aroint thee witch” the rump fed runnion cries
Thou 'rt kind
And I another
I’ll drain him dry as hay
Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his penthouse lid
He shall live a man forbid
Weary sev'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle peak and pine
Sweet remembrancer
May ’t please your highness sit
His absence sir Lays blame upon his promise
Please ’t your highness To grace us with your royal company
The table’s full
Here is a place reserved sir
Where
What my good lord
Gentlemen rise
His highness is not well
Sit worthy friends
My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth
Pray you keep seat
If much you note him You shall offend him and extend his passion
Feed and regard him not
Ay and a bold one that dare look on that Which might appall the devil
O proper stuff
This is the very painting of your fear
This is the air drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan
Oh these flaws and starts Impostors to true fear would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire Authorized by her grandam
Shame itself
Why do you make such faces
When all’s done You look but on a stool
Prithee see there
Behold
Look
If I stand here I saw him
Fie for shame
The time has been That when the brains were out the man would die And there an end
But now they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns And push us from our stools
This is more strange Than such a murder is
My worthy lord Your noble friends do lack you
Our duties and the pledge
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear The armed rhinoceros or th' Hyrcan tiger Take any shape but that and my firm nerves Shall never tremble
Or be alive again And dare me to the desert with thy sword
If trembling I inhabit then protest me The baby of a girl
Hence horrible shadow
Unreal mockery hence
Why so being gone      Why so being gone I am a man again
Pray you sit still
You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting With most admired disorder
What sights my lord
I pray you speak not
He grows worse and worse
Question enrages him
At once good night
A kind good night to all
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak
Almost at odds with morning which is which
Did you send to him sir
I hear it by the way but I will send
There’s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d
I will tomorrow  And betimes I will to the weird sisters
More shall they speak for now I am bent to know By the worst means the worst
For mine own good All causes shall give way
Strange things I have in head that will to hand Which must be acted ere they may be scanned
Come we’ll to sleep
My strange and self abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use
We are yet but young in deed
Why how now Hecate
You look angerly
Have I not reason beldams as you are
But make amends now
Get you gone And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i' th' morning
Thither he Will come to know his destiny
Your vessels and your spells provide Your charms and everything beside
I am for the air
This night I’ll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end
Great business must be wrought ere noon
Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap'rous drop profound
I’ll catch it ere it come to ground
And that distilled by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion
He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear His hopes 'bove wisdom grace and fear
And you all know security Is mortals' chiefest enemy
Hark
I am called
My little spirit see Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me
Only I say Things have been strangely borne
Men must not walk too late
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father
All which we pine for now
And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war
Sent he to Macduff
I’ll send my prayers with him
Though his bark cannot be lost Yet it shall be tempest tossed
Look what I have
Show me show me
A drum a drum
Macbeth doth come
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed
Harpier cries “'Tis time ’tis time” Round about the cauldron go In the poisoned entrails throw
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Cool it with a baboon’s blood Then the charm is firm and good
Oh well done
I commend your pains And every one shall share i' th' gains
And now about the cauldron sing Like elves and fairies in a ring Enchanting all that you put in
By the pricking of my thumbs Something wicked this way comes
Open locks Whoever knocks
How now you secret black and midnight hags
What is ’t you do
A deed without a name
I conjure you by that which you profess  Howe'er you come to know it answer me
Speak
Demand
We’ll answer
Say if th' hadst rather hear it from our mouths Or from our masters'
Call 'em
Let me see 'em
Pour in sow’s blood that hath eaten Her nine farrow grease that’s sweaten From the murderer’s gibbet throw Into the flame
Tell me thou unknown power       He knows thy thought
Hear his speech but say thou nought
Macbeth
Macbeth
Macbeth
Beware Macduff
Beware the thane of Fife
Dismiss me
Enough
Whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks
Thou hast harped my fear aright
But one word more  He will not be commanded
Here’s another More potent than the first
Macbeth
Macbeth  Had I three ears I’d hear thee
Be bloody bold and resolute
Laugh to scorn The power of man for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth
But yet I’ll make assurance double sure And take a bond of fate
Thou shalt not live That I may tell pale hearted fear it lies And sleep in spite of thunder
What is this That rises like the issue of a king And wears upon his baby brow the round And top of sovereignty
Listen but speak not to ’t
Be lion mettled proud and take no care Who chafes who frets or where conspirers are
Macbeth shall never vanquished be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him
That will never be
Who can impress the forest bid the tree Unfix his earthbound root
Sweet bodements
Good
Rebellious dead rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise and our high placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature pay his breath To time and mortal custom
Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing
Tell me if your art Can tell so much shall Banquo’s issue ever Reign in this kingdom
Seek to know no more
I will be satisfied
Deny me this And an eternal curse fall on you
Let me know
Why sinks that cauldron
And what noise is this
Show
Show
Show
Show his eyes and grieve his heart
Come like shadows so depart
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo
I’ll see no more
Horrible sight
What is this so
Come sisters cheer we up his sprites And show the best of our delights
Where are they
Gone
Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursèd in the calendar
What’s your grace’s will
Saw you the weird sisters
No my lord
Came they not by you
No indeed my lord
I did hear The galloping of horse
Who was ’t came by
Tis two or three my lord that bring you word Macduff is fled to England
Fled to England
Ay my good lord
Time thou anticipat’st my dread exploits
No boasting like a fool
This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool
But no more sights Where are these gentlemen
Come bring me where they are
What had he done to make him fly the land
You must have patience madam
He had none
His flight was madness
When our actions do not Our fears do make us traitors
You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear
Wisdom
To leave his wife to leave his babes His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly
For the poor wren The most diminutive of birds will fight Her young ones in her nest against the owl
All is the fear and nothing is the love As little is the wisdom where the flight So runs against all reason
My dearest coz I pray you school yourself
But for your husband He is noble wise judicious and best knows The fits o' th' season
I take my leave of you
Shall not be long but I’ll be here again
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward To what they were before My pretty cousin Blessing upon you
Fathered he is and yet he’s fatherless
I am so much a fool should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort
I take my leave at once
Sirrah your father’s dead
And what will you do now
How will you live
As birds do Mother
What with worms and flies
With what I get I mean and so do they
Poor bird
Thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime The pitfall nor the gin
My father is not dead for all your saying
Yes he is dead
How wilt thou do for a father
Nay how will you do for a husband
Why I can buy me twenty at any market
Speak if you can what are you
All hail Macbeth
Hail to thee thane of Glamis
All hail Macbeth
Hail
Hail
Hail
Lesser than Macbeth and greater
Not so happy yet much happier
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
Then you’ll buy 'em to sell again
Thou speak’st with all thy wit and yet i' faith With wit enough for thee
Was my father a traitor Mother
Ay that he was
What is a traitor
Why one that swears and lies
And be all traitors that do so
Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie
Every one
Who must hang them
Why the honest men
Then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them
If he were dead you’d weep for him
If you would not it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father
Poor prattler how thou talk’st
Bless you fair dame
I am not to you known Though in your state of honor I am perfect
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly
If you will take a homely man’s advice Be not found here
Hence with your little ones
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage To do worse to you were fell cruelty Which is too nigh your person
Heaven preserve you
I dare abide no longer
Whither should I fly
I have done no harm
But I remember now I am in this earthly world where to do harm Is often laudable to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly
Why then alas Do I put up that womanly defense To say I have done no harm
What are these faces
Where is your husband
I hope in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him
He’s a traitor
Thou liest thou shag haired villain
Young fry of treachery
He has killed me mother
Run away I pray you
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty
Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men Bestride our downfall'n birthdom
Each new morn New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows Strike heaven on the face that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor
What you have spoke it may be so perchance
This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues Was once thought honest
You have loved him well
He hath not touched you yet
I am young but something You may deserve of him through me and wisdom To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb T' appease an angry god
I am not treacherous
But Macbeth is
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge
But I shall crave your pardon
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
Angels are bright still though the brightest fell
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace Yet grace must still look so
Why in that rawness left you wife and child Those precious motives those strong knots of love Without leave taking
I pray you Let not my jealousies be your dishonors But mine own safeties
You may be rightly just Whatever I shall think
Bleed bleed poor country
I would not be the villain that thou think’st For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp And the rich East to boot
Be not offended
I speak not as in absolute fear of you
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke
It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds
I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands
What should he be
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth
I grant him bloody Luxurious avaricious false deceitful Sudden malicious smacking of every sin That has a name
But there’s no bottom none In my voluptuousness
Your wives your daughters Your matrons and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will
Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign
Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny
It hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours
We have willing dames enough
This avarice Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root Than summer seeming lust and it hath been The sword of our slain kings
But I have none
Nay had I power I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell Uproar the universal peace confound All unity on earth
O Scotland Scotland
If such a one be fit to govern speak
Fare thee well
Whither indeed before thy here approach Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point was setting forth
Why are you silent
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'Tis hard to reconcile
Well more anon Comes the king forth I pray you
Ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure
Their malady convinces The great assay of art but at his touch  Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand  They presently amend
I thank you doctor
What’s the disease he means
Tis called the evil
A most miraculous work in this good king Which often since my here remain in England I have seen him do
With this strange virtue He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy And sundry blessings hang about his throne That speak him full of grace
See who comes here
My countryman but yet I know him not
My ever gentle cousin welcome hither
Sir amen
Stands Scotland where it did
Alas poor country
Almost afraid to know itself
Oh relation Too nice and yet too true
Banquo and Macbeth all hail
Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting
Speak I charge you
The earth hath bubbles as the water has And these are of them
Whither are they vanished
Would they had stayed
Were such things here as we do speak about
Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner
Your children shall be kings
You shall be king
And thane of Cawdor too went it not so
To the selfsame tune and words
Who’s here
How does my wife
Why well
And all my children
Well too
How goes ’t
Now is the time of help
Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out
Would I could answer This comfort with the like
What concern they
If it be mine Keep it not from me
Quickly let me have it
I guess at it
Your castle is surprised your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered
Merciful heaven
My children too
Wife children servants all that could be found
And I must be from thence
My wife killed too
I have said
Let’s make us med'cines of our great revenge To cure this deadly grief
He has no children
All my pretty ones
Did you say all
O hell kite
All
What all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop
Dispute it like a man
I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me
Did heaven look on And would not take their part
Sinful Macduff They were all struck for thee
Naught that I am Not for their own demerits but for mine Fell slaughter on their souls
Heaven rest them now
Be this the whetstone of your sword
Let grief Convert to anger
Oh I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue
But gentle heavens Cut short all intermission
Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself
Within my sword’s length set him if he ’scape Heaven forgive him too
This tune goes manly
Come go we to the king
Our power is ready Our lack is nothing but our leave
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking and the powers above Put on their instruments
Receive what cheer you may
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report
When was it she last walked
Since his majesty went into the field I have seen her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upon ’t read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep
In this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say
That sir which I will not report after her
Neither to you nor any one having no witness to confirm my speech
Lo you here she comes
This is her very guise and upon my life fast asleep
Observe her stand close
How came she by that light
Why it stood by her
She has light by her continually
Tis her command
You see her eyes are open
Ay but their sense is shut
What is it she does now
Look how she rubs her hands
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands
Yet here’s a spot
Hark
She speaks
I will set down what comes from her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
Do you mark that
The thane of Fife had a wife
Where is she now What will these hands ne'er be clean No more o' that my lord no more o' that
You have known what you should not
She has spoke what she should not I am sure of that
Heaven knows what she has known
Here’s the smell of the blood still
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand
Oh Oh Oh
What a sigh is there
The heart is sorely charged
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body
Well well well
Pray God it be sir
This disease is beyond my practice
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds
Wash your hands
Put on your nightgown
Even so
To bed to bed
There’s knocking at the gate
Will she go now to bed
God God forgive us all
Good night good doctor
The English power is near led on by Malcolm His uncle Siward and the good Macduff
Revenges burn in them for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother
For certain sir he is not
I have a file Of all the gentry
What does the tyrant
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies
But for certain He cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there
Make we our march towards Birnam
Silenced with that In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make Strange images of death
As thick as tale Can post with post and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense And poured them down before him
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks Only to herald thee into his sight Not pay thee
Why do you dress me In borrowed robes
Whether he was combined With those of Norway or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage or that with both He labored in his country’s wrack I know not But treasons capital confessed and proved Have overthrown him
Bring me no more reports
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear
What’s the boy Malcolm
Was he not born of woman
The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus “Fear not Macbeth
No man that’s born of woman Shall e'er have power upon thee” Then fly false thanes And mingle with the English epicures
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear
The devil damn thee black thou cream faced loon
Where got’st thou that goose look
There is ten thousand  Geese villain
Soldiers sir
Go prick thy face and over red thy fear Thou lily livered boy
What soldiers patch
Death of thy soul
Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear
What soldiers whey face
The English force so please you
Take thy face hence
Seyton I am sick at heart When I behold Seyton I say This push Will cheer me ever or disseat me now
I have lived long enough
Seyton
What’s your gracious pleasure
What news more
All is confirmed my lord which was reported
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked
Give me my armor
Tis not needed yet
I’ll put it on
Send out more horses
Give me mine armor
Not so sick my lord As she is troubled with thick coming fancies That keep her from her rest
Cure her of that
Therein the patient Must minister to himself
Throw physic to the dogs I’ll none of it
Come put mine armor on
Ay my good lord
Your royal preparation Makes us hear something
Cousins I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe
We doubt it nothing
What wood is this before us
The wood of Birnam
Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear ’t before him
Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us
It shall be done
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before ’t
Hang out our banners on the outward walls
The cry is still “They come” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up
Were they not forced with those that should be ours We might have met them dareful beard to beard And beat them backward home
What is that noise
It is the cry of women my good lord
I have almost forgot the taste of fears
The time has been my senses would have cooled To hear a night shriek and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in ’t
Wherefore was that cry
The queen my lord is dead
She should have died hereafter
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death
Out out brief candle
It is a tale Told by an idiot full of sound and fury Signifying nothing
Gracious my lord I should report that which I say I saw But know not how to do ’t
Well say sir
As I did stand my watch upon the hill I looked toward Birnam and anon methought The wood began to move
Liar and slave
Let me endure your wrath if ’t be not so
Within this three mile may you see it coming I say a moving grove
If thou speak’st false Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee
If thy speech be sooth I care not if thou dost for me as much
Now near enough
Fare you well
Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight Let us be beaten if we cannot fight
They have tied me to a stake
I cannot fly But bearlike I must fight the course
What’s he That was not born of woman
Such a one Am I to fear or none
What is thy name
Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it
No though thou call’st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell
My name’s Macbeth
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear
No nor more fearful
Thou liest abhorrèd tyrant
But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn Brandished by man that’s of a woman born
But ’tis strange
That way the noise is
Tyrant show thy face
Either thou Macbeth Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded
There thou shouldst be By this great clatter one of the greatest note Seems bruited
This way my lord
The castle’s gently rendered
Enter sir the castle
Turn hellhound turn
But get thee back
I have no words
My voice is in my sword
Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests I bear a charmèd life which must not yield To one of woman born
I’ll not fight with thee
Then yield thee coward And live to be the show and gaze o' th' time
We’ll have thee as our rarer monsters are Painted on a pole and underwrit “Here may you see the tyrant”      I will not yield To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet And to be baited with the rabble’s curse
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane And thou opposed being of no woman born Yet I will try the last
Before my body I throw my warlike shield
Lay on Macduff And damned be him that first cries “Hold enough” I would the friends we miss were safe arrived
Some must go off
Macduff is missing and your noble son
Your son my lord has paid a soldier’s debt
He only lived but till he was a man The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought But like a man he died
Then he is dead
Ay and brought off the field
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth for then It hath no end
Had he his hurts before
Ay on the front
Why then God’s soldier be he
Had I as many sons as I have hairs I would not wish them to a fairer death
And so his knell is knolled
He’s worth more sorrow And that I’ll spend for him
He’s worth no more
They say he parted well and paid his score
And so God be with him
Here comes newer comfort
Hail king
For so thou art
Behold where stands The usurper’s cursèd head
The time is free
Hail King of Scotland
My thanes and kinsmen Henceforth be earls the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named
So thanks to all at once and to each one Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone
Look how our partner’s rapt
Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure
Kind gentlemen your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them
Let us toward the king
Very gladly
Till then enough
My liege They are not yet come back
But I have spoke With one that saw him die who did report That very frankly he confessed his treasons Implored your highness' pardon and set forth A deep repentance
Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it
He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ’twere a careless trifle
There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face
Welcome hither
So humbly take my leave
My worthy Cawdor
When shall we three meet again
In thunder lightning or in rain
That will be ere the set of sun
Where the place
There to meet with Macbeth
What thou wouldst highly That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false And yet wouldst wrongly win
Thou'ld’st have great Glamis That which cries “Thus thou must do” if thou have it And that which rather thou dost fear to do Than wishest should be undone
What is your tidings
The king comes here tonight
Thou 'rt mad to say it
One of my fellows had the speed of him Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more Than would make up his message
Give him tending
He brings great news
My dearest love Duncan comes here tonight
And when goes hence
Tomorrow as he purposes
O never Shall sun that morrow see
Your face my thane is as a book where men May read strange matters
Bear welcome in your eye Your hand your tongue
Look like th' innocent flower But be the serpent under ’t
We will speak further
Leave all the rest to me
This castle hath a pleasant seat
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses
This guest of summer The temple haunting martlet does approve By his loved mansionry that the heaven’s breath Smells wooingly here
No jutty frieze Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle
Where they most breed and haunt I have observed The air is delicate
See see our honored hostess
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble Which still we thank as love
Fair and noble hostess We are your guest tonight
Your servants ever Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt To make their audit at your highness' pleasure Still to return your own
Give me your hand
Conduct me to mine host
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him
By your leave hostess
If it were done when ’tis done then ’twere well It were done quickly
What news
He has almost supped
Why have you left the chamber
Hath he asked for me
Know you not he has
We will proceed no further in this business
He hath honored me of late and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people Which would be worn now in their newest gloss Not cast aside so soon
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself
From this time Such I account thy love
Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire
Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life And live a coward in thine own esteem Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would ” Like the poor cat i' th' adage
What beast was ’t then That made you break this enterprise to me
What not put upon His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell
Bring forth men children only For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males
Will it not be received When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers That they have done ’t
Away and mock the time with fairest show
False face must hide what the false heart doth know
How goes the night boy
The moon is down
I have not heard the clock
And she goes down at twelve
I take ’t ’tis later sir
Hold take my sword
There’s husbandry in heaven Their candles are all out
Take thee that too
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me And yet I would not sleep
Merciful powers Restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose
Give me my sword
Who’s there
A friend
What sir not yet at rest
The king’s a bed
He hath been in unusual pleasure and Sent forth great largess to your offices
This diamond he greets your wife withal By the name of most kind hostess and shut up In measureless content
Being unprepared Our will became the servant to defect Which else should free have wrought
What bloody man is that
He can report As seemeth by his plight of the revolt The newest state
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought 'Gainst my captivity
Hail brave friend
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it
Doubtful it stood As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art
O valiant cousin
Worthy gentleman
All’s well
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters To you they have showed some truth
I think not of them
Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve We would spend it in some words upon that business If you would grant the time
At your kind’st leisure
If you shall cleave to my consent when ’tis It shall make honor for you
Good repose the while
Thanks sir the like to you
Get thee to bed
Is this a dagger which I see before me The handle toward my hand
Whiles I threat he lives
Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
What hath quenched them hath given me fire
Hark
Peace
My husband
I have done the deed
Didst thou not hear a noise
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
Did not you speak
When
Now
As I descended
Ay
Hark
Who lies i' th' second chamber
Donalbain
A foolish thought to say a sorry sight
One cried “God bless us” and “Amen” the other As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands
List'ning their fear I could not say “Amen” When they did say “God bless us” Consider it not so deeply
But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”
I had most need of blessing and “Amen” Stuck in my throat
These deeds must not be thought After these ways
So it will make us mad
Methought I heard a voice cry “Sleep no more
What do you mean
Still it cried “Sleep no more” to all the house
Go get some water And wash this filthy witness from your hand
Why did you bring these daggers from the place
They must lie there
Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood
Infirm of purpose
Give me the daggers
The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures
If he do bleed I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal For it must seem their guilt
Whence is that knocking
How is ’t with me when every noise appals me
I hear a knocking At the south entry
Retire we to our chamber
A little water clears us of this deed
How easy is it then
Your constancy Hath left you unattended
Hark
More knocking
Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers
Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts
Wake Duncan with thy knocking
I would thou couldst
Knock knock knock
Knock knock
Who’s there in th' other devil’s name
O come in equivocator
Knock knock knock
Who’s there
Faith here’s an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose
Come in tailor
Here you may roast your goose
Knock knock
Never at quiet
What are you
But this place is too cold for hell
I’ll devil porter it no further
Anon anon
I pray you remember the porter
Was it so late friend ere you went to bed That you do lie so late
What three things does drink especially provoke
Lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes
It provokes the desire but it takes away the performance
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night
Is thy master stirring
Our knocking has awaked him
Here he comes
Good morrow noble sir
Good morrow both
Is the king stirring worthy thane
Not yet
He did command me to call timely on him
I have almost slipped the hour
I’ll bring you to him
I know this is a joyful trouble to you But yet ’tis one
The labor we delight in physics pain
This is the door
I’ll make so bold to call For ’tis my limited service
Goes the king hence today
He does
He did appoint so
The night has been unruly
Where we lay Our chimneys were blown down and as they say Lamentings heard i' th' air strange screams of death And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to the woeful time
The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night
Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake
Twas a rough night
My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it
O horror horror horror
Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee
What’s the matter
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece
The life”
Mean you his majesty
Mark King of Scotland mark No sooner justice had with valor armed Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage With furbished arms and new supplies of men Began a fresh assault
Dismayed not this our captains Macbeth and Banquo
Yes as sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
If I say sooth I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds They smack of honor both
Go get him surgeons
Who comes here
So should he look That seems to speak things strange
Approach the chamber and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon
Do not bid me speak
See and then speak yourselves
Awake awake
Ring the alarum bell
Murder and treason
Banquo and Donalbain
Awake
Shake off this downy sleep death’s counterfeit And look on death itself
Up up and see The great doom’s image
Malcolm
Banquo
As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites To countenance this horror
Speak speak
O gentle lady 'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak The repetition in a woman’s ear Would murder as it fell
O Banquo Banquo Our royal master’s murdered
Woe alas
What in our house
Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself And say it is not so
Had I but died an hour before this chance I had lived a blessèd time for from this instant There’s nothing serious in mortality
All is but toys
Renown and grace is dead
The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of
What is amiss
You are and do not know ’t
The spring the head the fountain of your blood Is stopped the very source of it is stopped
Your royal father’s murdered
Oh by whom
Those of his chamber as it seemed had done ’t
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood
So were their daggers which unwiped we found Upon their pillows
They stared and were distracted
No man’s life was to be trusted with them
Oh yet I do repent me of my fury That I did kill them
Wherefore did you so
Who can be wise amazed temp'rate and furious Loyal and neutral in a moment
Here lay Duncan His silver skin laced with his golden blood And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance there the murderers Steeped in the colors of their trade their daggers Unmannerly breeched with gore
Who could refrain That had a heart to love and in that heart Courage to make ’s love known
Help me hence ho
Look to the lady
Fears and scruples shake us
In the great hand of God I stand and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice
And so do I
So all
Let’s briefly put on manly readiness And meet i' th' hall together
Well contented
What will you do
Let’s not consort with them
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy
I’ll to England
To Ireland I
Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer
Where we are There’s daggers in men’s smiles
The near in blood The nearer bloody
This murderous shaft that’s shot Hath not yet lighted and our safest way Is to avoid the aim
There’s warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left
Threescore and ten I can remember well Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings
By th' clock ’tis day And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp
Tis said they eat each other
They did so to th' amazement of mine eyes That looked upon ’t
Here comes the good Macduff
How goes the world sir now
Why see you not
Those that Macbeth hath slain
They were suborned
Malcolm and Donalbain the king’s two sons Are stol'n away and fled which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed
Thriftless ambition that will raven up Thine own lives' means
Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested
Where is Duncan’s body
Carried to Colmekill The sacred storehouse of his predecessors And guardian of their bones
Will you to Scone
No cousin I’ll to Fife
Well I will thither
Well may you see things well done there
Adieu Lest our old robes sit easier than our new
Farewell father
God’s benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes
Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings
If there come truth from them  As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine  Why by the verities on thee made good May they not be my oracles as well And set me up in hope
But hush no more
Here’s our chief guest
Let your highness Command upon me to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit
Ride you this afternoon
Ay my good lord
We should have else desired your good advice  Which still hath been both grave and prosperous  In this day’s council but we’ll take tomorrow
Is ’t far you ride
As far my lord as will fill up the time 'Twixt this and supper
Go not my horse the better I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain
Fail not our feast
My lord I will not
But of that tomorrow When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly
Hie you to horse
Adieu Till your return at night
Goes Fleance with you
Ay my good lord
Our time does call upon ’s
Farewell
Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night
To make society The sweeter welcome we will keep ourself Till suppertime alone
While then God be with you
Bring them before us
Our fears in Banquo Stick deep and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be feared
Tis much he dares And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety
There is none but he Whose being I do fear and under him My genius is rebuked as it is said Mark Antony’s was by Caesar
Then prophetlike They hailed him father to a line of kings
Who’s there
God save the king
Great happiness
That now Sweno the Norways' king craves composition
Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest go pronounce his present death And with his former title greet Macbeth
I’ll see it done
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won
Now go to the door and stay there till we call
Was it not yesterday we spoke together
It was so please your highness
Well then now Have you considered of my speeches
This I made good to you In our last conference passed in probation with you How you were borne in hand how crossed the instruments Who wrought with them and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say “Thus did Banquo”      You made it known to us
I did so and went further which is now Our point of second meeting
Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go
Are you so gospeled To pray for this good man and for his issue Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave And beggared yours forever
We are men my liege
Ay in the catalogue ye go for men As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs Shoughs water rugs and demi wolves are clept All by the name of dogs
And so of men
I am one my liege Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world
And I another So weary with disasters tugged with fortune That I would set my life on any chance To mend it or be rid on ’t
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy
True my lord
We shall my lord Perform what you command us
Though our lives  Your spirits shine through you
We are resolved my lord
I’ll call upon you straight
Abide within
It is concluded
Banquo thy soul’s flight If it find heaven must find it out tonight
Is Banquo gone from court
Ay madam but returns again tonight
Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words
Madam I will
Naught’s had all’s spent Where our desire is got without content
Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
How now my lord
What’s done is done
We have scorched the snake not killed it
She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth
Better be with the dead Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy
Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison Malice domestic foreign levy nothing Can touch him further
Come on gentle my lord Sleek o'er your rugged looks
So shall I love And so I pray be you
You must leave this
Thou know’st that Banquo and his Fleance lives
There’s comfort yet they are assailable
Then be thou jocund
Ere the bat hath flown His cloistered flight ere to black Hecate’s summons The shard borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night’s yawning peal there shall be done A deed of dreadful note
What’s to be done
What many men desire” that “many” may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach Which pries not to th' interior but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall Even in the force and road of casualty
I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes
Why then to thee thou silver treasure house
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves” And well said too for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honorable Without the stamp of merit
Let none presume To wear an undeservèd dignity
Oh that estates degrees and offices Were not derived corruptly and that clear honor Were purchased by the merit of the wearer
How many then should cover that stand bare
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honor
Well but to my choice
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves” I will assume desert Give me a key for this And instantly unlock my fortunes here
Too long a pause for that which you find there
What’s here
I will read it  How much unlike art thou to Portia
Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves”
Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head
Is that my prize
Are my deserts no better
What is here
The fire seven times tried this Seven times tried that judgment is That did never choose amiss
Some there be that shadows kiss
Such have but a shadow’s bliss
There be fools alive iwis Silvered o'er and so was this
Take what wife you will to bed I will ever be your head
So be gone
With one fool’s head I came to woo But I go away with two  Sweet adieu
I’ll keep my oath Patiently to bear my wroth”
Thus hath the candle singed the moth
O these deliberate fools
When they do choose They have the wisdom by their wit to lose
The ancient saying is no heresy
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny
Come draw the curtain Nerissa
Where is my lady
Here
What would my lord
Yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love
No more I pray thee
I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee Thou spend’st such high day wit in praising him  Come come Nerissa for I long to see Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly
Now what news on the Rialto
But it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the honest Antonio oh that I had a title good enough to keep his name company Come the full stop
Ha what sayest thou
Why the end is he hath lost a ship
I would it might prove the end of his losses
Let me say “Amen” betimes lest the devil cross my prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew
How now Shylock
What news among the merchants
You knew none so well none so well as you of my daughter’s flight
That’s certain
I for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal
She is damned for it
That’s certain if the devil may be her judge
My own flesh and blood to rebel
Out upon it old carrion
Rebels it at these years
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood
But tell us do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no
Well we will leave you then till dinnertime
I must be one of these same dumb wise men For Gratiano never lets me speak
Well keep me company but two years more Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
Farewell
I’ll grow a talker for this gear
Is that any thing now
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice
Well tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage That you today promised to tell me of
There I have another bad match a bankrupt a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto a beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart
Let him look to his bond
He was wont to call me usurer let him look to his bond
He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy let him look to his bond
Why I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh
What’s that good for
To bait fish withal
He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million laughed at my losses mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my bargains cooled my friends heated mine enemies and what’s his reason
I am a Jew
Hath not a Jew eyes
Hath not a Jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions
Fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is
If you prick us do we not bleed
If you tickle us do we not laugh
If you poison us do we not die
And if you wrong us shall we not revenge
If we are like you in the rest we will resemble you in that
If a Jew wrong a Christian what is his humility
Revenge
We have been up and down to seek him
Here comes another of the tribe
A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew
How now Tubal
What news from Genoa
Hast thou found my daughter
I often came where I did hear of her but cannot find her
Why there there there there
I never felt it till now Two thousand ducats in that and other precious precious jewels
I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin
No news of them
Why so
And I know not what’s spent in the search
Why thou loss upon loss
Yes other men have ill luck too
Antonio as I heard in Genoa  What what what
Ill luck ill luck
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis
I thank God I thank God
Is ’t true is ’t true
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack
I thank thee good Tubal
Good news good news
Ha ha heard in Genoa
Your daughter spent in Genoa as I heard in one night fourscore ducats
Thou stickest a dagger in me
I shall never see my gold again
Fourscore ducats at a sitting
Fourscore ducats
There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break
I am very glad of it
I’ll plague him
I’ll torture him
I am glad of it
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey
Out upon her
Thou torturest me Tubal
It was my turquoise
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys
But Antonio is certainly undone
Nay that’s true that’s very true
Bespeak him a fortnight before I will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will Go go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue
Go good Tubal
At our synagogue Tubal
Before you hazard for in choosing wrong I lose your company
Therefore forbear awhile
There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love
Promise me life and I’ll confess the truth
Well then confess and live
Confess and love” Had been the very sum of my confession
But let me to my fortune and the caskets
Away then
I am locked in one of them
If you do love me you will find me out  Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
Let music sound while he doth make his choice
Then if he lose he makes a swanlike end Fading in music
He may win And what is music then
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives With blearèd visages come forth to view The issue of th' exploit Go Hercules
Live thou I live
With much much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makest the fray
Ding dong bell
How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars Who inward searched have livers white as milk And these assume but valor’s excrement To render them redoubted
So are those crispèd snaky golden locks Which maketh such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposèd fairness often known To be the dowry of a second head The skull that bred them in the sepulcher
Thus ornament is but the guilèd shore To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest
Therefore then thou gaudy gold Hard food for Midas I will none of thee
Since this fortune falls to you Be content and seek no new
If you be well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss”
A gentle scroll
Fair lady by your leave I come by note to give and to receive
Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes Hearing applause and universal shout Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no  So thrice fair lady stand I even so As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmed signed ratified by you
You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand Such as I am
Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself  A thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich  That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue beauties livings friends Exceed account
Happier than this  She is not bred so dull but she can learn
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord her governor her king
Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted
But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion master of my servants Queen o'er myself
And even now but now This house these servants and this same myself Are yours my lord’s
I give them with this ring Which when you part from lose or give away Let it presage the ruin of your love
I pray you good Bassanio let me know it
And if it stand as you yourself still do Within the eye of honor be assured My purse my person my extremest means Lie all unlocked to your occasions
In my school days when I had lost one shaft I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight The selfsame way with more advisèd watch To find the other forth and by adventuring both I oft found both
I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence
I owe you much and like a willful youth That which I owe is lost
You know me well and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have
Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done And I am pressed unto it
Therefore speak
O then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead
My lord and lady it is now our time That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper To cry “Good joy good joy my lord and lady” My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady I wish you all the joy that you can wish For I am sure you can wish none from me
And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too
With all my heart so thou canst get a wife
I thank your lordship you have got me one
What and stake down
What and my old Venetian friend Salerio
Lorenzo and Salerio welcome hither If that the youth of my new interest here Have power to bid you welcome
So do I my lord
They are entirely welcome
And I have reason for it
Signor Antonio Commends him to you
Ere I ope his letter I pray you tell me how my good friend doth
Not sick my lord unless it be in mind Nor well unless in mind
His letter there Will show you his estate
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the color from Bassanio’s cheek
Some dear friend dead else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man
What worse and worse  With leave Bassanio I am half yourself And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you
O sweet Portia Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words That ever blotted paper
Gentle lady When I did first impart my love to you I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins
I was a gentleman And then I told you true
When I told you My state was nothing I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend Engaged my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means
Have all his ventures failed
What not one hit
Not one my lord
Besides it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew He would not take it
Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man
He plies the duke at morning and at night And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice
When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him
And I know my lord If law authority and power deny not It will go hard with poor Antonio
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
What sum owes he the Jew
For me three thousand ducats
What no more
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond
You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over
When it is paid bring your true friend along
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows
Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer
But let me hear the letter of your friend
Sweet Bassanio my ships have all miscarried
My creditors grow cruel
My estate is very low
My bond to the Jew is forfeit
Notwithstanding use your pleasure
If your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter” O love dispatch all business and be gone
Since I have your good leave to go away I will make haste
But till I come again No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay No rest be interposer ’twixt us twain
Jailer look to him
This is the fool that lent out money gratis
Jailer look to him
Hear me yet good Shylock
I pray thee hear me speak
I’ll have my bond
I will not hear thee speak
I’ll have my bond and therefore speak no more
I’ll not be made a soft and dull eyed fool To shake the head relent and sigh and yield To Christian intercessors
Follow not
I’ll have no speaking
I will have my bond
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men
Let him alone
I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers
He seeks my life
His reason well I know
I oft delivered from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me
Therefore he hates me
I am sure the duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold
Therefore go
These griefs and losses have so bated me That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor  Well jailer on Pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt and then I care not
Lorenzo I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord’s return
Madam with all my heart
I shall obey you in all fair commands
My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself
So fare you well till we shall meet again
Fare you well Jessica
Now Balthazar As I have ever found thee honest true So let me find thee still
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages
Her name is Portia nothing undervalued To Cato’s daughter Brutus' Portia
I shall be there before thee
Madam I go with all convenient speed
Come on Nerissa I have work in hand That you yet know not of
We’ll see our husbands Before they think of us
Shall they see us
They shall Nerissa but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplishèd With that we lack
And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell That men shall swear I have discontinued school Above a twelvemonth
I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks Which I will practice
Why shall we turn to men
Fie what a question’s that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter
But come I’ll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach which stays for us At the park gate
And therefore haste away For we must measure twenty miles today
Yes truly for look you the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children
Therefore I promise ye I fear you
I was always plain with you and so now I speak my agitation of the matter
Therefore be o' good cheer for truly I think you are damned
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither
And what hope is that I pray thee
Marry you may partly hope that your father got you not that you are not the Jew’s daughter
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed
So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother
Thus when I shun Scylla your father I fall into Charybdis your mother
Well you are gone both ways
I shall be saved by my husband
He hath made me a Christian
Truly the more to blame he
We were Christians eno' before e'en as many as could well live one by another
This making Christians will raise the price of hogs
If we grow all to be pork eaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money
I’ll tell my husband Launcelot what you say
Here he comes
I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if you thus get my wife into corners
Nay you need not fear us Lorenzo
Launcelot and I are out
He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro’s belly
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason
I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots
That is done sir
They have all stomachs
Goodly Lord what a wit snapper are you
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant
For the table sir it shall be served in
For the meat sir it shall be covered
For your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall govern
O dear discretion how his words are suited
How cheerest thou Jessica
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife
Past all expressing
And if on earth he do not merit it In reason he should never come to heaven
Why if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women And Portia one there must be something else Pawned with the other for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow
Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife
First let us go to dinner
Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach
No pray thee let it serve for table talk
What is Antonio here
Ready so please your grace
I am sorry for thee
Thou art come to answer A stony adversary an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity void and empty From any dram of mercy
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course
But since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy’s reach I do oppose My patience to his fury and am armed To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his
Go one and call the Jew into the court
He is ready at the door
He comes my lord
We all expect a gentle answer Jew
I have possessed your grace of what I purpose And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond
If you deny it let the danger light Upon your charter and your city’s freedom
You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats
I’ll not answer that But say it is my humour
Is it answered
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned
What are you answered yet
Some men there are love not a gaping pig Some that are mad if they behold a cat And others when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose Cannot contain their urine
Are you answered
This is no answer thou unfeeling man To excuse the current of thy cruelty
I am not bound to please thee with my answers
Do all men kill the things they do not love
What wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
You may as well do anything most hard As seek to soften that than which what’s harder  His Jewish heart
I would have my bond
How shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none
What judgment shall I dread doing no wrong
You have among you many a purchased slave Which like your asses and your dogs and mules  You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them
Shall I say to you “Let them be free
Marry them to your heirs
Why sweat they under burdens
Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasoned with such viands”
You will answer “The slaves are ours” So do I answer you
The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought
Tis mine and I will have it
If you deny me fie upon your law  There is no force in the decrees of Venice
I stand for judgment
By my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world
And yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing
It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean
Good sentences and well pronounced
They would be better if well followed
It is a good divine that follows his own instructions
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband
Is it not hard Nerissa that I cannot choose one nor refuse none
Upon my power I may dismiss this court Unless Bellario a learnèd doctor Whom I have sent for to determine this Come here today
Bring us the letter
Call the messenger
Good cheer Antonio
What man courage yet
The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
I am a tainted wether of the flock Meetest for death
The weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground and so let me
You cannot better be employed Bassanio Than to live still and write mine epitaph
Came you from Padua from Bellario
From both my lord
Bellario greets your grace
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew Thou makest thy knife keen
But no metal can  No not the hangman’s axe bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy
Can no prayers pierce thee
No none that thou hast wit enough to make
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith To hold opinion with Pythagoras That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men
Thy currish spirit Governed a wolf who hanged for human slaughter Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infused itself in thee for thy desires Are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud
Repair thy wit good youth or it will fall To cureless ruin
I stand here for law
This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learnèd doctor to our court
Where is he
He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you’ll admit him
With all my heart Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place  Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter
His name is Balthazar
I leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation” You hear the learned Bellario what he writes
Come you from old Bellario
I did my lord
You are welcome
Take your place
Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court
I am informèd thoroughly of the cause
Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth
Is your name Shylock
Shylock is my name
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed  Ay so he says
Do you confess the bond
I do
Then must the Jew be merciful
On what compulsion must I
Tell me that
The quality of mercy is not strained
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath
It is twice blessed It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
Tis mightiest in the mightiest
It becomes The thronèd monarch better than his crown
And earthly power doth then show likest God’s When mercy seasons justice
I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there
My deeds upon my head
I crave the law The penalty and forfeit of my bond
Is he not able to discharge the money
If that will not suffice I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er On forfeit of my hands my head my heart
There is no power in Venice Can alter a decree establishèd
Twill be recorded for a precedent And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state
It cannot be
I pray you let me look upon the bond
Shylock there’s thrice thy money offered thee
An oath an oath I have an oath in heaven
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul
No not for Venice
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant’s heart Be merciful
Take thrice thy money
Bid me tear the bond
When it is paid according to the tenor
It doth appear you are a worthy judge
You know the law
I charge you by the law Whereof you are a well deserving pillar Proceed to judgment
By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me
I stay here on my bond
Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment
Why then thus it is You must prepare your bosom for his knife
O noble judge
O excellent young man
For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty Which here appeareth due upon the bond
Tis very true
O wise and upright judge
How much more elder art thou than thy looks
Ay his breast
Nearest his heart” those are the very words
It is so
Are there balance here to weigh The flesh
I have them ready
Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
Is it so nominated in the bond
It is not so expressed but what of that
Twere good you do so much for charity
I cannot find it
Tis not in the bond
But little
I am armed and well prepared  Give me your hand Bassanio
Fare you well
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough I’ll pay it presently with all my heart
Antonio I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself
But life itself my wife and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life
I would lose all ay sacrifice them all Here to this devil to deliver you
Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer
I have a wife whom I protest I love
I would she were in heaven so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew
Tis well you offer it behind her back
These be the Christian husbands
I have a daughter
The court awards it and the law doth give it
Most rightful judge
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast
The law allows it and the court awards it
Most learnèd judge a sentence
Come prepare
Tarry a little
There is something else
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
The words expressly are “a pound of flesh” Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice
Is that the law
Thyself shalt see the act
For as thou urgest justice be assured Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest
I take this offer then pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go
Here is the money
Soft
The Jew shall have all justice
Soft no haste
He shall have nothing but the penalty
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh
If thou takest more Or less than a just pound be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
A second Daniel A Daniel Jew
Now infidel I have you on the hip
Why doth the Jew pause
Take thy forfeiture
Give me my principal and let me go
I have it ready for thee
Here it is
Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations
I pray thee overname them
First there is the Neapolitan prince
I am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith
Then there is the County Palatine
He doth nothing but frown as who should say “An you will not have me choose” He hears merry tales and smiles not
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth
I had rather be married to a death’s head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these
God defend me from these two
How say you by the French lord Monsieur le Bon
He hath refused it in the open court
He shall have merely justice and his bond
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril Jew
Why then the devil give him good of it
I’ll stay no longer question
Tarry Jew
The law hath yet another hold on you
It is enacted in the laws of Venice If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods
The other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state And the offender’s life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only 'gainst all other voice
Down therefore and beg mercy of the Duke
Therefore thou must be hanged at the state’s charge
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
For half thy wealth it is Antonio’s
The other half comes to the general state Which humbleness may drive unto a fine
Ay for the state not for Antonio
Nay take my life and all
Pardon not that
You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house
You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live
What mercy can you render him Antonio
A halter gratis nothing else for God’s sake
So please my lord the duke and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter
Two things provided more that for this favor He presently become a Christian The other that he do record a gift Here in the court of all he dies possessed Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter
He shall do this or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronouncèd here
Art thou contented Jew
What dost thou say
I am content
I pray you give me leave to go from hence
I am not well
Send the deed after me And I will sign it
Get thee gone but do it
I must away this night toward Padua And it is meet I presently set forth
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not  Antonio gratify this gentleman For in my mind you are much bound to him
And stand indebted over and above In love and service to you evermore
He is well paid that is well satisfied
And I delivering you am satisfied And therein do account myself well paid
My mind was never yet more mercenary
I pray you know me when we meet again
I wish you well and so I take my leave
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute Not as a fee
This ring good sir alas it is a trifle
I will not shame myself to give you this
I will have nothing else but only this
And now methinks I have a mind to it
There’s more depends on this than on the value
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you And find it out by proclamation
Only for this I pray you pardon me
I see sir you are liberal in offers
You taught me first to beg and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answered
Good sir this ring was given me by my wife
And when she put it on she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it
That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts
An if your wife be not a madwoman And know how well I have deserved the ring She would not hold out enemy forever For giving it to me
Well peace be with you
My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring
Come you and I will thither presently
And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont
Come Antonio
Inquire the Jew’s house out
Give him this deed And let him sign it
We’ll away tonight And be a day before our husbands home
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo
Furthermore I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house
That will I do
Away make haste
Thou know’st where I will tarry
The moon shines bright
In such a night as this When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night
In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well Stealing her soul with many vows of faith And ne'er a true one
In such a night Did pretty Jessica like a little shrew Slander her love and he forgave it her
But hark I hear the footing of a man
Who comes so fast in silence of the night
A friend
A friend
What friend
Your name I pray you friend
Stephano is my name and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont
She doth stray about By holy crosses where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours
Who comes with her
None but a holy hermit and her maid
I pray you is my master yet returned
Sola sola
Wo ha ho
Sola sola
Who calls
Sola
Did you see Master Lorenzo
Leave holloaing man
Here
Sola
Where where
Here
Tell him there’s a post come from my master with his horn full of good news
My master will be here ere morning
Sweet soul let’s in and there expect their coming
And yet no matter
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man
In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine
What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron of England
You know I say nothing to him for he understands not me nor I him
He hath neither Latin French nor Italian and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English
He is a proper man’s picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show
How oddly he is suited
I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his behavior everywhere
What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbor
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears
Soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony
Sit Jessica
Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold
Come ho and wake Diana with a hymn
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear And draw her home with music
I am never merry when I hear sweet music
The motions of his spirit are dull as night And his affections dark as Erebus
Let no such man be trusted
Mark the music
That light we see is burning in my hall
How far that little candle throws his beams
So shines a good deed in a naughty world
When the moon shone we did not see the candle
So doth the greater glory dim the less
A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by and then his state Empties itself as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters
Music hark
It is your music madam of the house
Nothing is good I see without respect
How many things by season seasoned are To their right praise and true perfection
Peace
How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked
That is the voice Or I am much deceived of Portia
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo  By the bad voice
Dear lady welcome home
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare Which speed we hope the better for our words
Are they returned
Go in Nerissa
Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence  Nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you
I hear his trumpet
This night methinks is but the daylight sick
It looks a little paler
Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid
I thank you madam
Give welcome to my friend
This is the man this is Antonio To whom I am so infinitely bound
Sir you are very welcome to our house
It must appear in other ways than words Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy
A quarrel ho already
What’s the matter
About a hoop of gold a paltry ring That she did give me whose posy was For all the world like cutler’s poetry Upon a knife “Love me and leave me not” What talk you of the posy or the value
You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death And that it should lie with you in your grave
Gave it a judge’s clerk
He will an if he live to be a man
Ay if a woman live to be a man
I could not for my heart deny it him
You were to blame I must be plain with you To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it
And here he stands
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters
Now in faith Gratiano You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
An ’twere to me I should be mad at it
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begged it and indeed Deserved it too
And then the boy his clerk That took some pains in writing he begged mine
And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings
What ring gave you my lord
Not that I hope which you received of me
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it
but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it
It is gone
Sweet Portia If you did know to whom I gave the ring If you did know for whom I gave the ring And would conceive for what I gave the ring And how unwillingly I left the ring When naught would be accepted but the ring You would abate the strength of your displeasure
If you had known the virtue of the ring Or half her worthiness that gave the ring Or your own honor to contain the ring You would not then have parted with the ring
Nerissa teaches me what to believe
I’ll die for ’t but some woman had the ring
What should I say sweet lady
I was enforced to send it after him
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved And that which you did swear to keep for me I will become as liberal as you
I’ll not deny him anything I have No not my body nor my husband’s bed
Know him I shall I am well sure of it
Lie not a night from home
Watch me like Argus
If you do not if I be left alone Now by mine honor which is yet mine own  I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow
I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels
Sir grieve not you
Portia forgive me this enforcèd wrong And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself      Mark you but that
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself  In each eye one
Swear by your double self And there’s an oath of credit
Nay but hear me
Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee
I once did lend my body for his wealth Which but for him that had your husband’s ring Had quite miscarried
By heaven it is the same I gave the doctor
I had it of him
What are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it
Speak not so grossly You are all amazed
I am dumb
Ay but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man
Sweet lady you have given me life and living
How like you the young German the Duke of Saxony’s nephew
Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk
When he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast
I will do any thing Nerissa ere I’ll be married to a sponge
You need not fear lady the having any of these lords
And I pray God grant them a fair departure
Do you not remember lady in your father’s time a Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat
How now Lorenzo
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you
Ay and I’ll give them him without a fee
Fair ladies you drop manna in the way Of starvèd people
It is almost morning And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full
Let us go in And charge us there upon interr'gatories And we will answer all things faithfully
Let it be so
The first interr'gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is Whether till the next night she had rather stay Or go to bed now being two hours to day
But were the day come I should wish it dark That I were couching with the doctor’s clerk
True madam
He of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady
I remember him well and I remember him worthy of thy praise
How now what news
The four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should be glad of his approach
If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had rather he should shrive me than wive me
Come Nerissa 
Three thousand ducats well
Ay sir for three months
For three months well
For the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound
Antonio shall become bound well
May you stead me
Will you pleasure me
Shall I know your answer
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound
Your answer to that
Antonio is a good man
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary
Yet his means are in supposition
He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another to the Indies
I understand moreover upon the Rialto he hath a third at Mexico a fourth for England and other ventures he hath squandered abroad
But ships are but boards sailors but men
There be land rats and water rats water thieves and land thieves I mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks
The man is notwithstanding sufficient
Be assured you may
This is Signor Antonio
In sooth I know not why I am so sad
It wearies me you say it wearies you
Believe me sir had I such venture forth The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad
And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad
Shylock do you hear
I am debating of my present store And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats
What of that
Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe Will furnish me
But soft
How many months Do you desire
Shylock albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend I’ll break a custom
Ay ay three thousand ducats
And for three months
I had forgot three months
You told me so
I do never use it
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban’s sheep  This Jacob from our holy Abram was As his wise mother wrought in his behalf The third possessor ay he was the third  And what of him
Did he take interest
This was a venture sir that Jacob served for  A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
But note me signor 
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek A goodly apple rotten at the heart
Oh what a goodly outside falsehood hath
Three months from twelve then
Let me see
The rate  Well Shylock shall we be beholding to you
Signor Antonio many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances
You call me misbeliever cutthroat dog And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine  And all for use of that which is mine own
Well then it now appears you need my help
Go to then
You come to me and you say “Shylock we would have moneys” You say so  You that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold
Moneys is your suit
What should I say to you
Should I not say “Hath a dog money
Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats” Or Shall I bend low and in a bondman’s key With bated breath and whispering humbleness Say this
If thou wilt lend this money lend it not As to thy friends for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend
But lend it rather to thine enemy Who if he break thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty
Why look you how you storm
I would be friends with you and have your love Forget the shames that you have stained me with Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys and you’ll not hear me
This is kind I offer
This were kindness
This kindness will I show
Go with me to a notary seal me there Your single bond and in a merry sport  If you repay me not on such a day In such a place such sum or sums as are Expressed in the condition let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me
Content in faith
I’ll seal to such a bond And say there is much kindness in the Jew
You shall not seal to such a bond for me
I’ll rather dwell in my necessity
Within these two months that’s a month before This bond expires I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond
A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable profitable neither As flesh of muttons beefs or goats
If he will take it so
If not adieu
And for my love I pray you wrong me not
Yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond
Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s
Give him direction for this merry bond And I will go and purse the ducats straight See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave and presently I will be with you
Hie thee gentle Jew
My ships come home a month before the day
I would not change this hue Except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen
Even for that I thank you
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune
By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she bear Yea mock the lion when he roars for prey To win the lady
But alas the while
Nor will not
Come bring me unto my chance
First forward to the temple
After dinner Your hazard shall be made
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master
For the heavens rouse up a brave mind” says the fiend “and run” Well my conscience hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely to me “My honest friend Launcelot being an honest man’s son” or rather an honest woman’s son for indeed my father did something smack something grow to
He had a kind of taste Well my conscience says “Launcelot budge not” “Budge” says the fiend
Budge not” says my conscience
Conscience” say I “you counsel well” “Fiend” say I “you counsel well” To be ruled by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master who God bless the mark is a kind of devil
And to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend who saving your reverence is the devil himself
The fiend gives the more friendly counsel
I will run fiend
I will run
Master young man you I pray you which is the way to Master Jew’s
Master young gentleman I pray you which is the way to Master Jew’s
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning but at the next turning of all on your left
Marry at the very next turning turn of no hand but turn down indirectly to the Jew’s house
By God’s sonties ’twill be a hard way to hit
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him dwell with him or no
Talk you of young Master Launcelot
No “master” sir but a poor man’s son
His father though I say ’t is an honest exceeding poor man and God be thanked well to live
Your worship’s friend and Launcelot sir
Shall I have the thought To think on this and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanced would make me sad
But tell not me
Believe me no
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
Why then you are in love
Not in love neither
But I pray you ergo old man ergo I beseech you talk you of young Master Launcelot
Ergo Master Launcelot
Marry God forbid
The boy was the very staff of my age my very prop
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel post a staff or a prop
Do you know me Father
Alack the day I know you not young gentleman
But I pray you tell me is my boy God rest his soul alive or dead
Do you not know me Father
Alack sir I am sand blind
I know you not
Nay indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of the knowing me
It is a wise father that knows his own child
Well old man I will tell you news of your son
Give me your blessing
Pray you sir stand up
I am sure you are not Launcelot my boy
Pray you let’s have no more fooling about it but give me your blessing
I am Launcelot your boy that was your son that is your child that shall be
I cannot think you are my son
Her name is Margery indeed
I’ll be sworn if thou be Launcelot thou art mine own flesh and blood
It should seem then that Dobbin’s tail grows backward
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him
Lord how art thou changed
How dost thou and thy master agree
I have brought him a present
How 'gree you now
My master’s a very Jew
Give him a present
Give him a halter
I am famished in his service
You may tell every finger I have with my ribs
Father I am glad you are come
Give me your present to one Master Bassanio who indeed gives rare new liveries
Gramercy
Wouldst thou aught with me
What would you
Serve you sir
That is the very defect of the matter sir
I know thee well
Thou hast obtained thy suit
Father in
My best endeavours shall be done herein
Yonder sir he walks
Signor Bassanio
Gratiano
I have a suit to you
You have obtained it
You must not deny me
I must go with you to Belmont
Why then you must
But hear thee Gratiano
Thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice  Parts that become thee happily enough And in such eyes as ours appear not faults
Pray thee take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior I be misconst’red in the place I go to And lose my hopes
Signor Bassanio hear me
If I do not put on a sober habit Talk with respect and swear but now and then Wear prayer books in my pocket look demurely  Nay more
While grace is saying hood mine eyes Thus with my hat and sigh and say “Amen”  Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam never trust me more
Well we shall see your bearing
Nay but I bar tonight
You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight
I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends That purpose merriment
But fare you well
I have some business
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so
Our house is hell and thou a merry devil Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness
And Launcelot soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo who is thy new master’s guest
Give him this letter
Adieu
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee I am much deceived
But adieu
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit
Adieu
Farewell good Launcelot
Alack what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father’s child
But though I am a daughter to his blood I am not to his manners
O Lorenzo If thou keep promise I shall end this strife Become a Christian and thy loving wife
Nay we will slink away in supper time Disguise us at my lodging and return All in an hour
We have not made good preparation
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers
Tis vile unless it may be quaintly ordered And better in my mind not undertook
Tis now but four o'clock
We have two hours To furnish us
Friend Launcelot what’s the news
I know the hand
Love news in faith
Whither goest thou
Marry sir to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian
And so will I
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence
Tis good we do so
Was not that letter from fair Jessica
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper And other of such vinegar aspect That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable
Fare ye well
Your worth is very dear in my regard
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th' occasion to depart
Good signors both when shall we laugh
My Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio We two will leave you
I will not fail you
I must needs tell thee all
Who bids thee call
I do not bid thee call
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding
Call you
What is your will
I am bid forth to supper Jessica
There are my keys But wherefore should I go
I am not bid for love
They flatter me
But yet I’ll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian Jessica my girl Look to my house
I am right loath to go
There is some ill a brewing towards my rest For I did dream of money bags tonight
I beseech you sir go
My young master doth expect your reproach
So do I his
And they have conspired together
I will not say you shall see a masque but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i' th' morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th' afternoon
What are there masques
But stop my house’s ears I mean my casements  Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house
By Jacob’s staff I swear I have no mind of feasting forth tonight
I will go before sir  Mistress look out at window for all this
What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring ha
His words were “Farewell mistress” Nothing else
The patch is kind enough but a huge feeder Snail slow in profit and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat
Drones hive not with me
Well Jessica go in
Perhaps I will return immediately
Do as I bid you
Shut doors after you
Fast bind fast find
Farewell and if my fortune be not crost I have a father you a daughter lost
This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand
His hour is almost past
And it is marvel he outdwells his hour For lovers ever run before the clock
Oh ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly To seal love’s bonds new made than they are wont To keep obligèd faith unforfeited
That ever holds
Who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down
Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first
All things that are Are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed
Here comes Lorenzo
More of this hereafter
Sweet friends your patience for my long abode
Not I but my affairs have made you wait
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives I’ll watch as long for you then
Approach
Who’s within
Who are you
Tell me for more certainty Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue
Lorenzo and thy love
Lorenzo certain and my love indeed  For who love I so much
And now who knows But you Lorenzo whether I am yours
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
Here catch this casket
It is worth the pains
Descend for you must be my torchbearer
What must I hold a candle to my shames
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats and be with you straight
Now by my hood a gentle and no Jew
Beshrew me but I love her heartily
For she is wise if I can judge of her
And fair she is if that mine eyes be true
And true she is as she hath proved herself
And therefore like herself wise fair and true  Shall she be placèd in my constant soul
What art thou come On gentlemen away
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay
Who’s there
Signor Antonio
Tis nine o'clock
Our friends all stay for you
No masque tonight
I have sent twenty out to seek for you
I am glad on ’t
I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight
The one of them contains my picture Prince
If you choose that then I am yours withal
Some god direct my judgment
Let me see
I will survey th' inscriptions back again
What says this leaden casket
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath” Must give for what
For lead
Hazard for lead
This casket threatens
Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross
I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
What says the silver with her virgin hue
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves” “As much as he deserves” pause there Morocco And weigh thy value with an even hand
What if I strayed no further but chose here
Let’s see once more this saying graved in gold “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire” Why that’s the lady
All the world desires her
From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine this mortal breathing saint
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia
The watery kingdom whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven is no bar To stop the foreign spirits but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia
One of these three contains her heavenly picture
Is ’t like that lead contains her
Twere damnation To think so base a thought
It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
Or shall I think in silver she’s immured Being ten times undervalued to tried gold
O sinful thought
Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold
They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamped in gold but that’s insculped upon
You look not well Signor Antonio
You have too much respect upon the world
And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans
I’ll tell thee more of this another time
But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon this opinion  Come good Lorenzo Fare ye well awhile
I’ll end my exhortation after dinner
Lies all within Deliver me the key
Here do I choose and thrive I as I may
There take it Prince
O hell what have we here
A carrion death within whose empty eye There is a written scroll
I’ll read the writing
All that glisters is not gold  Often have you heard that told
Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold
Gilded tombs do worms enfold
Had you been as wise as bold Young in limbs in judgment old Your answer had not been inscrolled
Portia adieu
I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave
Thus losers part
A gentle riddance Draw the curtains go  Let all of his complexion choose me so
Why man I saw Bassanio under sail
With him is Gratiano gone along
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship
He came too late
The ship was under sail
But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica
Besides Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship
I never heard a passion so confused So strange outrageous and so variable As the dog Jew did utter in the streets
O my daughter Fled with a Christian
O my Christian ducats
Justice find the girl
She hath the stones upon her and the ducats” Why all the boys in Venice follow him Crying “His stones his daughter and his ducats”
Let good Antonio look he keep his day Or he shall pay for this
Marry well remembered
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday Who told me in the narrow seas that part The French and English there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear  Yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part
Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return
And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me Let it not enter in your mind of love
And so they parted
I think he only loves the world for him
I pray thee let us go and find him out And quicken his embracèd heaviness With some delight or other
Do we so
Draw the curtain straight
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently
Behold there stand the caskets noble Prince
If you choose that wherein I am contained Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized
But if you fail without more speech my lord You must be gone from hence immediately
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self
And so have I addressed me
Fortune now To my heart’s hope
Gold silver and base lead
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath” You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard
What says the golden chest
Ha let me see
So with two seeming bodies but one heart Two of the first like coats in heraldry Due but to one and crownèd with one crest
And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend
It is not friendly ’tis not maidenly
Our sex as well as I may chide you for it Though I alone do feel the injury
I scorn you not
It seems that you scorn me
Have you not set Lysander as in scorn To follow me and praise my eyes and face
And made your other love Demetrius  Who even but now did spurn me with his foot  To call me goddess nymph divine and rare Precious celestial
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love so rich within his soul And tender me forsooth affection But by your setting on by your consent
What though I be not so in grace as you  So hung upon with love so fortunate  But miserable most to love unloved
This you should pity rather than despise
I understand not what you mean by this
Ay do
Persever counterfeit sad looks Make mouths upon me when I turn my back Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up  This sport well carried shall be chronicled
If you have any pity grace or manners You would not make me such an argument
But fare ye well
Tis partly my own fault Which death or absence soon shall remedy
Stay gentle Helena
Hear my excuse
My love my life my soul fair Helena
Oh excellent
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers  Helen I love thee
By my life I do
I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not
I say I love thee more than he can do
If thou say so withdraw and prove it too
Lysander whereto tends all this
Why are you grown so rude
Thy love
Out tawny Tartar out
Out loathèd medicine
O hated potion hence
Do you not jest
Yes sooth and so do you
Demetrius I will keep my word with thee
I would I had your bond for I perceive A weak bond holds you
I’ll not trust your word
Although I hate her I’ll not harm her so
Ay by my life And never did desire to see thee more
Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
Be certain nothing truer
O me
Fine i' faith
Have you no modesty no maiden shame No touch of bashfulness
Puppet”
Why so Ay that way goes the game
How low am I thou painted maypole
Speak
How low am I
Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me
He followed you
For love I followed him
But he hath chid me hence and threatened me To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
Let me go
You see how simple and how fond I am
Why get you gone
Who is ’t that hinders you
A foolish heart that I leave here behind
What with Lysander
With Demetrius
Be not afraid
She shall not harm thee Helena
She was a vixen when she went to school
And though she be but little she is fierce
Little” again
Nothing but “low” and “little”  Why will you suffer her to flout me thus
Let me come to her
What cheer my love  Demetrius and Egeus go along
I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves
With duty and desire we follow you
How now my love
Why is your cheek so pale
How chance the roses there do fade so fast
Belike for want of rain which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
Ay me
For aught that I could ever read Could ever hear by tale or history The course of true love never did run smooth
But either it was different in blood 
Let her alone
Speak not of Helena
Take not her part
For if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her Thou shalt aby it
Now she holds me not
Now follow if thou darest to try whose right Of thine or mine is most in Helena
Follow”
Nay I’ll go with thee cheek by jowl
You mistress all this coil is long of you
Nay go not back
I am amazed and know not what to say
Believe me King of Shadows I mistook
Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garment he had on
And so far blameless proves my enterprise That I have 'nointed an Athenian’s eyes
And so far am I glad it so did sort As this their jangling I esteem a sport
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight
Hie therefore Robin overcast the night
The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another’s way
My fairy lord this must be done with haste
But we are spirits of another sort
I with the morning’s love have oft made sport And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate all fiery red Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
But notwithstanding haste
Make no delay
We may effect this business yet ere day
Up and down up and down  I will lead them up and down
I am feared in field and town
Goblin lead them up and down
Here comes one
Where art thou proud Demetrius
Speak thou now
Lysander speak again
Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
Speak
In some bush
Where dost thou hide thy head
Yea art thou there
He goes before me and still dares me on
When I come where he calls then he is gone
The villain is much lighter heeled than I I followed fast but faster he did fly That fallen am I in dark uneven way
And here will rest me
Where art thou now
Nay then thou mock’st me
Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see
Now go thy way
O weary night O long and tedious night Abate thy hours
Yet but three
Come one more
Two of both kinds make up four
Here she comes cursed and sad
Cupid is a knavish lad  Thus to make poor females mad
Here will I rest me till the break of day
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray
On the ground  Sleep sound
Where’s Peaseblossom
Ready
Scratch my head Peaseblossom
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb
Ready
Do not fret yourself too much in the action monsieur
And good monsieur have a care the honey bag break not
I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag signor
Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed
Ready
Give me your neaf Monsieur Mustardseed
Pray you leave your courtesy good monsieur
What’s your will
Nothing good monsieur but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch
I must to the barber’s monsieur for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face
And I am such a tender ass if my hair do but tickle me I must scratch
What wilt thou hear some music my sweet love
I have a reasonable good ear in music
Let’s have the tongs and the bones
Or say sweet love what thou desirest to eat
Truly a peck of provender
I could munch your good dry oats
Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay
Good hay sweet hay hath no fellow
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas
But I pray you let none of your people stir me
I have an exposition of sleep come upon me
Sleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms
Oh how I love thee
How I dote on thee
Welcome good Robin
Seest thou this sweet sight
Her dotage now I do begin to pity
For meeting her of late behind the wood Seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool I did upbraid her and fall out with her
For she his hairy temples then had rounded With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers And that same dew which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
And now I have the boy I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes
And gentle Puck take this transformèd scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain That he awaking when the other do May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night’s accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream
But first I will release the fairy queen
Now my Titania wake you my sweet queen
There lies your love
How came these things to pass
Oh how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
Silence awhile Robin take off this head  Titania music call and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense
Music ho
Music such as charmeth sleep
Sound music Come my queen take hands with me And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
Too old to be engaged to young
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends  O hell to choose love by another’s eyes
So quick bright things come to confusion
If then true lovers have been ever crossed It stands as an edict in destiny
A good persuasion
Therefore hear me Hermia
I have a widow aunt a dowager Of great revenue and she hath no child
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues And she respects me as her only son
There gentle Hermia may I marry thee
And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us
Fairy King attend and mark
I do hear the morning lark
Then my queen in silence sad Trip we after the night’s shade
Come my lord and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground
Go one of you find out the forester
Uncouple in the western valley
Let them go
Dispatch I say and find the forester
We will fair queen up to the mountain’s top And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta
The skies the fountains every region near Seemed all one mutual cry
I never heard So musical a discord such sweet thunder
I wonder of their being here together
But speak Egeus
Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice
It is my lord
Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
Good morrow friends
Saint Valentine is past
Begin these woodbirds but to couple now
Pardon my lord
I pray you all stand up
My lord I shall reply amazèdly Half sleep half waking
But as yet I swear I cannot truly say how I came here
But as I think for truly would I speak And now do I bethink me so it is  I came with Hermia hither
And all the faith the virtue of my heart The object and the pleasure of mine eye Is only Helena
To her my lord Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia
Fair lovers you are fortunately met
Of this discourse we more will hear anon  Egeus I will overbear your will
Away with us to Athens
Three and three We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity
Are you sure That we are awake
It seems to me That yet we sleep we dream
And he did bid us follow to the temple
Why then we are awake
It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no bottom
And I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke
Peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it at her death
Have you sent to Bottom’s house
Is he come home yet
He cannot be heard of
Out of doubt he is transported
If he come not then the play is marred
It goes not forward
Doth it
It is not possible
No he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens
Yea and the best person too
And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice
You must say “paragon” A “paramour” is God bless us a thing of naught
Masters the duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married
If our sport had gone forward we had all been made men
O sweet bully Bottom
Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life
He could not have ’scaped sixpence a day
An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus I’ll be hanged
He would have deserved it
Where are these hearts
Bottom
O most courageous day
O most happy hour
I will tell you everything right as it fell out
Let us hear sweet Bottom
Not a word of me
All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined
Get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps
Meet presently at the palace
Every man look o'er his part
And most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath
And I do not doubt but to hear them say “It is a sweet comedy” No more words
Away go away
Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak of
I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys
The lunatic the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact
But all the story of the night told over And all their minds transfigured so together More witnesseth than fancy’s images And grows to something of great constancy But howsoever strange and admirable
Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth  Joy gentle friends
Come now what masques what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after supper and bedtime
Where is our usual manager of mirth
What revels are in hand
Call Philostrate
Here mighty Theseus
What masque what music
How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight
Keep promise love
Look here comes Helena
Godspeed fair Helena
Whither away
Call you me “fair”
That “fair” again unsay
Demetrius loves your fair
O happy fair
Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue’s sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
Were the world mine Demetrius being bated The rest I’d give to be to you translated
The thrice three Muses mourning for the death  Of learning late deceased in beggary” That is some satire keen and critical Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
Tedious” and “brief”
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
How shall we find the concord of this discord
A play there is my lord some ten words long Which is as brief as I have known a play
For in all the play There is not one word apt one player fitted
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself
Which when I saw rehearsed I must confess Made mine eyes water but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed
What are they that do play it
And we will hear it
No my noble lord
It is not for you
I have heard it over And it is nothing nothing in the world  Unless you can find sport in their intents Extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain To do you service
I will hear that play
Go bring them in And take your places ladies
Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
He says they can do nothing in this kind
Where I have come great clerks have purposèd To greet me with premeditated welcomes Where I have seen them shiver and look pale Make periods in the midst of sentences Throttle their practiced accent in their fears And in conclusion dumbly have broke off Not paying me a welcome
Love therefore and tongue tied simplicity In least speak most to my capacity
So please your grace the Prologue is addressed
Let him approach
If we offend it is with our good will
That you should think we come not to offend But with good will
Consider then we come but in despite
We do not come as minding to contest you Our true intent is
All for your delight We are not here
That you should here repent you The actors are at hand and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know
This fellow doth not stand upon points
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt
He knows not the stop
A good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true
His speech was like a tangled chain
Who is next
I wonder if the lion be to speak
No wonder my lord
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse my lord
Pyramus draws near the wall
Silence
I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot  And thou O Wall O sweet O lovely Wall That stand’st between her father’s ground and mine
Jove shield thee well for this
But what see I
No Thisbe do I see
O wicked Wall through whom I see no bliss
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me
The wall methinks being sensible should curse again
I see a voice
Now will I to the chink To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face
Thisbe
My love thou art my love I think
Think what thou wilt I am thy lover’s grace
Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway
Tide life tide death I come without delay
Thus have I Wall my part dischargèd so
And being done thus Wall away doth go
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard
The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them
It must be your imagination then and not theirs
Here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion
A very gentle beast of a good conscience
This lion is a very fox for his valor
True
And a goose for his discretion
Not so my lord
For his valor cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose
His discretion I am sure cannot carry his valor for the goose carries not the fox
It is well
Leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present
Myself the man i' th' moon do seem to be  This is the greatest error of all the rest
The man should be put into the lanthorn
How is it else the “man i' th' moon”
He dares not come there for the candle
For you see it is already in snuff
I am aweary of this moon
Proceed Moon
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I the man in the moon this thornbush my thornbush and this dog my dog
Why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon But silence
Here comes Thisbe
This is old Ninny’s tomb
Where is my love
Well roared Lion
Well run Thisbe
Well shone Moon Truly the moon shines with a good grace
Well moused Lion
O teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart
I frown upon him yet he loves me still
Oh that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
I give him curses yet he gives me love
Oh that my prayers could such affection move
The more I hate the more he follows me
The more I love the more he hateth me
His folly Helena is no fault of mine
None but your beauty
Would that fault were mine
Take comfort
He no more shall see my face
Lysander and myself will fly this place
Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me
Oh then what graces in my love do dwell That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell
Helen to you our minds we will unfold
Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass (A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal) Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal
And then came Pyramus
And so the lion vanished
Sweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams
But mark poor knight What dreadful dole is here
Eyes do you see
How can it be
O dainty duck
O dear
O Fates come come Cut thread and thrum
Quail crush conclude and quell
O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame
Thus die I thus thus thus
Now am I dead
Now die die die die die
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass
Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus
I hope she will be brief
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
And thus she means videlicet  Asleep my love
What dead my dove
O Pyramus arise
Speak speak
Quite dumb
Dead dead
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes
These lily lips This cherry nose These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone are gone
Lovers make moan
His eyes were green as leeks
O Sisters three Come come to me With hands as pale as milk
Lay them in gore Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk
Tongue not a word
Come trusty sword
Come blade my breast imbrue
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead
Ay and Wall too
No epilogue I pray you for your play needs no excuse
Never excuse for when the players are all dead there needs none to be blamed
Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe’s garter it would have been a fine tragedy
And so it is truly and very notably discharged
But come your Bergomask
Let your epilogue alone
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
Lovers to bed
Tis almost fairy time
Sweet friends to bed
Through the house give glimmering light By the dead and drowsy fire
First rehearse your song by rote To each word a warbling note
Hand in hand with fairy grace Will we sing and bless this place
If you pardon we will mend
And as I am an honest Puck  If we have unearnèd luck  Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue  We will make amends ere long
Else the Puck a liar call
So good night unto you all
Give me your hands if we be friends  And Robin shall restore amends
There my Lysander and myself shall meet
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies
Farewell sweet playfellow
We must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight
I will my Hermia
Helena adieu
As you on him Demetrius dote on you
But what of that
Demetrius thinks not so
He will not know what all but he do know
Things base and vile holding no quantity Love can transpose to form and dignity
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind
Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste  Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
And therefore is Love said to be a child Because in choice he is so oft beguiled
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her
Is all our company here
First good Peter Quince say what the play treats on then read the names of the actors and so grow to a point
Answer as I call you Nick Bottom the weaver
Ready
Name what part I am for and proceed
You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus
What is Pyramus
I will condole in some measure To the rest Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant
I could play Ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat in to make all split
A lover is more condoling
Francis Flute the bellows mender
Here Peter Quince
What is Thisbe
A wandering knight
It is the lady that Pyramus must love
Nay faith let me not play a woman
I have a beard coming
That’s all one
You shall play it in a mask and you may speak as small as you will
An I may hide my face let me play Thisbe too
You must play Pyramus And Flute you Thisbe
Robin Starveling the tailor
Here Peter Quince
Robin Starveling you must play Thisbe’s mother Tom Snout the tinker
Here Peter Quince
You Pyramus' father Myself Thisbe’s father Snug the joiner you the lion’s part And I hope here is a play fitted
Have you the lion’s part written
Pray you if it be give it me for I am slow of study
Let me play the lion too
And that were enough to hang us all
That would hang us every mother’s son
I grant you friends if you should fright the ladies out of their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us
For Pyramus is a sweet faced man a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day a most lovely gentlemanlike man
Therefore you must needs play Pyramus
Well I will undertake it
What beard were I best to play it in
Why what you will
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night
Four nights will quickly dream away the time
And then the moon like to a silver bow New bent in heaven shall behold the night Of our solemnities
Turn melancholy forth to funerals
The pale companion is not for our pomp
But I will wed thee in another key With pomp with triumph and with reveling
Happy be Theseus our renownèd duke
I will discharge it in either your straw color beard your orange tawny beard your purple in grain beard or your French crown color beard your perfect yellow
There will we rehearse for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company and our devices known
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants
I pray you fail me not
We will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously
Adieu
At the duke’s oak we meet
Enough
Hold or cut bowstrings
How now spirit
Whither wander you
Over hill over dale  Thorough bush thorough brier  Over park over pale  Thorough flood thorough fire
I do wander everywhere  Swifter than the moon’s sphere
And I serve the fairy queen  To dew her orbs upon the green
The cowslips tall her pensioners be
In those freckles live their savors
I must go seek some dewdrops here  And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear
Farewell thou lob of spirits
I’ll be gone
Our queen and all our elves come here anon
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king
And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train to trace the forests wild
But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
Those that “Hobgoblin” call you and “sweet Puck” You do their work and they shall have good luck
Are not you he
Thou speak’st aright
I am that merry wanderer of the night
And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab And when she drinks against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale
Then slip I from her bum down topples she And “Tailor” cries and falls into a cough And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there
But room fairy
Here comes Oberon
And here my mistress
Would that he were gone
What jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence
I have forsworn his bed and company
Tarry rash wanton
Why art thou here Come from the farthest step of India
But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon Your buskined mistress and your warrior love To Theseus must be wedded and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity
How canst thou thus for shame Titania Knowing I know thy love to Theseus
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna whom he ravishèd
And make him with fair Ægles break his faith With Ariadne and Antiopa
These are the forgeries of jealousy
And never since the middle summer’s spring Met we on hill in dale forest or mead By pavèd fountain or by rushy brook Or in the beachèd margent of the sea To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport
Therefore the winds piping to us in vain As in revenge have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents
The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain The ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard
The fold stands empty in the drownèd field And crows are fatted with the murrain flock
Therefore the moon the governess of floods Pale in her anger washes all the air That rheumatic diseases do abound
The spring the summer The childing autumn angry winter change Their wonted liveries and the mazèd world By their increase now knows not which is which
And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate from our dissension
We are their parents and original
Do you amend it then
It lies in you
Why should Titania cross her Oberon
I do but beg a little changeling boy To be my henchman
Set your heart at rest
The Fairyland buys not the child of me
How long within this wood intend you stay
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding day
If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels go with us
If not shun me and I will spare your haunts
Give me that boy and I will go with thee
Not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away
We shall chide downright if I longer stay
Well go thy way
Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury  My gentle Puck come hither
I remember
That very time I saw (but thou couldst not) Flying between the cold moon and the Earth Cupid all armed
A certain aim he took At a fair vestal thronèd by the west And loosed his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon And the imperial votaress passèd on In maiden meditation fancy free
Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell
It fell upon a little western flower Before milk white now purple with love’s wound
And maidens call it “love in idleness” Fetch me that flower
The herb I showed thee once
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees
Fetch me this herb and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league
I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes
Having once this juice I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes
The next thing then she waking looks upon  Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull On meddling monkey or on busy ape  She shall pursue it with the soul of love
And ere I take this charm from of her sight  As I can take it with another herb  I’ll make her render up her page to me
But who comes here
I love thee not therefore pursue me not
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia
The one I’ll stay the other stayeth me
Thou told’st me they were stol'n unto this wood
And here am I and wood within this wood Because I cannot meet my Hermia
Hence get thee gone and follow me no more
You draw me you hard hearted adamant
But yet you draw not iron for my heart Is true as steel
Leave you your power to draw And I shall have no power to follow you
Do I entice you
Do I speak you fair
Or rather do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you
And even for that do I love you the more
I am your spaniel
And Demetrius The more you beat me I will fawn on you
Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me Neglect me lose me
Only give me leave Unworthy as I am to follow you
For I am sick when I do look on thee
And I am sick when I look not on you
Your virtue is my privilege
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company For you in my respect are all the world
Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me
I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
The wildest hath not such a heart as you
Let me go
Or if thou follow me do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood
Ay in the temple in the town the field You do me mischief
Fie Demetrius
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
We cannot fight for love as men may do
I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell To die upon the hand I love so well
Fare thee well nymph
Ere he do leave this grove Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
Hast thou the flower there
Welcome wanderer
Ay there it is
I pray thee give it me
Thanks good Egeus
What’s the news with thee
Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child my daughter Hermia  Stand forth Demetrius My noble lord This man hath my consent to marry her  Stand forth Lysander And my gracious duke This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child  Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes And interchanged love tokens with my child
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair rings gauds conceits Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart Turned her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborn harshness And my gracious duke Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius I beg the ancient privilege of Athens
As she is mine I may dispose of her  Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death according to our law Immediately provided in that case
What say you Hermia
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight
And there the snake throws her enameled skin Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies
Fear not my lord
Your servant shall do so
Hence away
Now all is well
One aloof stand sentinel
What thou seest when thou dost wake Do it for thy true love take
Wake when some vile thing is near
Be it so Lysander
Find you out a bed For I upon this bank will rest my head
One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
Nay good Lysander
Do not lie so near
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it
Then by your side no bed room me deny
And good night sweet friend
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end
Amen amen to that fair prayer say I
Here is my bed
Pretty soul
Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius
I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
O wilt thou darkling leave me
Do not so
Stay on thy peril
I alone will go
Oh I am out of breath in this fond chase
The more my prayer the lesser is my grace
Happy is Hermia wheresoe'er she lies For she hath blessèd and attractive eyes
How came her eyes so bright
Not with salt tears
If so my eyes are oftener washed than hers
No no I am as ugly as a bear For beasts that meet me run away for fear
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do as a monster fly my presence thus
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne
Do not say so Lysander
Say not so
What though he love your Hermia
Lord what though
Content with Hermia
No
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent
Not Hermia but Helena I love
Things growing are not ripe until their season
So I being young till now ripe not to reason
Is ’t not enough is ’t not enough young man That I did never no nor never can Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye But you must flout my insufficiency
Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do In such disdainful manner me to woo
But fare you well
Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness
Oh that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused
Are we all met
Pat pat
And here’s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal
This green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn brake our tiring house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke
Peter Quince  What sayest thou bully Bottom
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please
First Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide
How answer you that
I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done
Not a whit
I have a device to make all well
Write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that Pyramus is not killed indeed
And for the more better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver
This will put them out of fear
Well
We will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six
No make it two more
Let it be written in eight and eight
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
I fear it I promise you
For there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your lion living
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion
Nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck
For you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight
So is Lysander
In himself he is
But in this kind wanting your father’s voice The other must be held the worthier
I would my father looked but with my eyes
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look
I do entreat your grace to pardon me
I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case If I refuse to wed Demetrius
Therefore fair Hermia question your desires
Know of your youth
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play
A calendar a calendar
Look in the almanac
Find out moonshine find out moonshine
What say you Bottom
And let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper
If that may be then all is well
Come sit down every mother’s son and rehearse your parts Pyramus you begin
When you have spoken your speech enter into that brake And so everyone according to his cue
Speak Pyramus Thisbe stand forth
Ay marry must you
For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again
Ninus' tomb” man
Why you must not speak that yet
You speak all your part at once cues and all Pyramus enter
It is “never tire” Oh
Oh monstrous
Oh strange
We are haunted
Fly masters
I’ll follow you
Sometime a horse I’ll be sometime a hound A hog a headless bear sometime a fire
And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn
Why do they run away
O Bottom thou art changed
What do I see on thee
What do you see
You see an ass head of your own do you
Bless thee Bottom bless thee
Thou art translated
But I will not stir from this place do what they can
I will walk up and down here and I will sing that they shall hear I am not afraid
For indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird
Methinks mistress you should have little reason for that
And yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together nowadays
The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
Not so neither
But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood I have enough to serve mine own turn
I am a spirit of no common rate
Therefore go with me
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go  Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseed
Ready
And I
And I
And I
Where shall we go
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
Feed him with apricoks and dewberries With purple grapes green figs and mulberries
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
Nod to him elves and do him courtesies
Hail mortal
Hail
Hail
Hail
I cry your worships' mercy heartily I beseech your worship’s name
Cobweb
I shall desire you of more acquaintance good Master Cobweb
If I cut my finger I shall make bold with you  Your name honest gentleman
Peaseblossom
I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash your mother and to Master Peascod your father
Good Master Peaseblossom I shall desire you of more acquaintance too  Your name I beseech you sir
Mustardseed
Good Master Mustardseed I know your patience well
That same cowardly giantlike ox beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now
I desire you of more acquaintance good Master Mustardseed
Come wait upon him
Lead him to my bower
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye
And when she weeps weeps every little flower Lamenting some enforcèd chastity
Tie up my love’s tongue
Bring him silently
Here comes my messenger How now mad spirit
What night rule now about this haunted grove
My mistress with a monster is in love
I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there
When in that moment so it came to pass Titania waked and straightway loved an ass
This falls out better than I could devise
But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes With the love juice as I did bid thee do
I took him sleeping that is finished too  And the Athenian woman by his side That when he waked of force she must be eyed
Oh why rebuke you him that loves you so
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep Being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep And kill me too
The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me
Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia
It cannot be but thou hast murdered him
So should a murderer look so dead so grim
So should the murdered look and so should I Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty
Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere
What’s this to my Lysander
Where is he
Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me
Hast thou slain him then
O brave touch
Could not a worm an adder do so much
An adder did it for with doubler tongue Than thine thou serpent never adder stung
I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood
Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell
I pray thee tell me then that he is well
An if I could what should I get therefore
Relent sweet Hermia And Lysander yield Thy crazèd title to my certain right
You have her father’s love Demetrius
And she is mine and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius
A privilege never to see me more
And from thy hated presence part I so
See me no more whether he be dead or no
Here therefore for a while I will remain
And laid the love juice on some true love’s sight
About the wood go swifter than the wind And Helena of Athens look thou find  All fancy sick she is and pale of cheer With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
Flower of this purple dye Hit with Cupid’s archery Sink in apple of his eye
When thou wakest if she be by Beg of her for remedy
Shall we their fond pageant see
Lord what fools these mortals be
Stand aside
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake
Then will two at once woo one
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn
Look when I vow I weep
How can these things in me seem scorn to you Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
You do advance your cunning more and more
Will you give her o'er
Demetrius loves her and he loves not you
Crystal is muddy
I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment
You are unkind Demetrius
Be not so
And yours of Helena to me bequeath Whom I do love and will do till my death
Lysander keep thy Hermia
I will none
Helen it is not so
Look where thy love comes
Dark night that from the eye his function takes The ear more quick of apprehension makes
Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found
Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go
What love could press Lysander from my side
Lysander’s love that would not let him bide Fair Helena who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light
Why seek’st thou me
Could not this make thee know The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so
You speak not as you think
It cannot be
Lo she is one of this confederacy
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three To fashion this false sport in spite of me  Injurious Hermia
Is all the counsel that we two have shared The sisters' vows the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty footed time For parting us oh is it all forgot
All schooldays' friendship childhood innocence
We Hermia like two artificial gods Have with our needles created both one flower Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion Both warbling of one song both in one key As if our hands our sides voices and minds Had been incorporate
So we grew together Like to a double cherry seeming parted But yet an union in partition  Two lovely berries molded on one stem
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes Misprizing what they look on and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak
She cannot love Nor take no shape nor project of affection She is so self endeared
Sure I think so And therefore certainly it were not good She knew his love lest she make sport at it
Why you speak truth
So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth
But who dare tell her so
If I should speak She would mock me into air
O she would laugh me Out of myself press me to death with wit
Therefore let Benedick like covered fire Consume away in sighs waste inwardly
It were a better death than die with mocks Which is as bad as die with tickling
No rather I will go to Benedick And counsel him to fight against his passion And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders To stain my cousin with
One doth not know How much an ill word may empoison liking
O do not do your cousin such a wrong
She cannot be so much without true judgment Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick
He is the only man of Italy Always excepted my dear Claudio
Indeed he hath an excellent good name
His excellence did earn it ere he had it
When are you married madam
Why every day tomorrow
Come go in
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go I toward Aragon
I’ll bring you thither my lord if you’ll vouchsafe me
Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth
He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bow string and the little hangman dare not shoot at him
He hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks
Gallants I am not as I have been
So say I Methinks you are sadder
I hope he be in love
There’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love
If he be sad he wants money
What sigh for the toothache
Yet say I he is in love
Unless he have a fancy to this foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you would have it appear he is
If he be not in love with some woman there is no believing old signs
He brushes his hat o' mornings
What should that bode
Hath any man seen him at the barber’s
No but the barber’s man hath been seen with him and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls
Nay he rubs himself with civet
Can you smell him out by that
You embrace your charge too willingly
Her mother hath many times told me so
You have it full Benedick
Truly the lady fathers herself Be happy lady for you are like an honorable father
If Signor Leonato be her father she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina as like him as she is
I wonder that you will still be talking Signor Benedick
Nobody marks you
What my dear Lady Disdain
Are you yet living
That’s as much as to say the sweet youth’s in love
The greatest note of it is his melancholy
And when was he wont to wash his face
Yea or to paint himself
For the which I hear what they say of him
Nay but his jesting spirit which is now crept into a lute string and now governed by stops  Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him
Conclude conclude he is in love
Nay but I know who loves him
She shall be buried with her face upwards
Yet is this no charm for the toothache Old Signior walk aside with me
Tis even so
My lord and brother God save you
Good e'en brother
If your leisure served I would speak with you
In private
If it please you
Yet Count Claudio may hear for what I would speak of concerns him
What’s the matter
You know he does
I know not that when he knows what I know
If there be any impediment I pray you discover it
You may think I love you not
Let that appear hereafter and aim better at me by that I now will manifest
For my brother I think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed
Why what’s the matter
I came hither to tell you and circumstances shortened for she has been too long a talking of the lady is disloyal
Who Hero
Even she Leonato’s Hero your Hero every man’s Hero
Disloyal
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness
I could say she were worse
Think you of a worse title and I will fit her to it
Wonder not till further warrant
Go but with me tonight you shall see her chamber window entered even the night before her wedding day
If you love her then tomorrow wed her
But it would better fit your honor to change your mind
I will not think it
If I see anything tonight why I should not marry her tomorrow in the congregation where I should wed there will I shame her
And as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join with thee to disgrace her
Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself
O day untowardly turned
O mischief strangely thwarting
O plague right well prevented
So will you say when you have seen the sequel
Are you good men and true
Come hither neighbor Seacole
God hath blessed you with a good name
To be a well favored man is the gift of fortune but to write and read comes by nature
Both which Master Constable  You have
I knew it would be your answer
Well for your favor sir why give God thanks and make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no need of such vanity
You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore bear you the lantern
How if he will not stand
Why then take no note of him but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave
If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the Prince’s subjects
We know what belongs to a watch
Why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for I cannot see how sleeping should offend
Well you are to call at all the alehouses and bid those that are drunk get them to bed
How if they will not
Why then let them alone till they are sober
If they make you not then the better answer you may say they are not the men you took them for
Well sir
If we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on him
You constable are to present the Prince’s own person
If you meet the Prince in the night you may stay him
Nay by 'r Lady that I think he cannot
Five shillings to one on ’t with any man that knows the statutes he may stay him marry not without the Prince be willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is an offense to stay a man against his will
By 'r lady I think it be so
An there be any matter of weight chances call up me
Well masters we hear our charge
Let us go sit here upon the church bench till two and then all to bed
One word more honest neighbors
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato’s door for the wedding being there tomorrow there is a great coil tonight
Adieu be vigitant I beseech you
What Conrade
Conrade I say
Mass and my elbow itched I thought there would a scab follow
I will owe thee an answer for that
And now forward with thy tale
Stand thee close then under this penthouse for it drizzles rain and I will like a true drunkard utter all to thee
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats
Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich
For when rich villains have need of poor ones poor ones may make what price they will
I wonder at it
That shows thou art unconfirmed
Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man
Yes it is apparel
Yes the fashion is the fashion
Tush I may as well say the fool’s the fool
Didst thou not hear somebody
No ’twas the vane on the house
But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion
Not so neither
But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman by the name of Hero
I should first tell thee how the Prince Claudio and my master planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter
Then is courtesy a turncoat
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies only you excepted
And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart for truly I love none
A dear happiness to women
They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me
God keep your Ladyship still in that mind so some gentle  man or other shall ’scape a predestinate scratched face
Scratching could not make it worse an ’twere such a face as yours were
Well you are a rare parrot teacher
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer
I have done
You always end with a jade’s trick
I know you of old
That is the sum of all Leonato Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart
And thought they Margaret was Hero
We charge you in the Prince’s name stand
Call up the right Master Constable
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth
And one Deformed is one of them
I know him he wears a lock
Masters masters  warrant you
Masters never speak we charge you let us obey you go with us
A commodity in question I warrant you Come we’ll obey you
Good Ursula wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to rise
I will lady
And bid her come hither
Well
Troth I think your other rebato were better
No pray thee good Meg I’ll wear this
By my troth ’s not so good and I warrant your cousin will say so
My cousin’s a fool and thou art another
I’ll wear none but this
I like the new tire within excellently if the hair were a thought browner and your gown’s a most rare fashion i' faith
I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown that they praise so
Oh that exceeds they say
But for a fine quaint graceful and excellent fashion yours is worth ten on ’t
God give me joy to wear it for my heart is exceeding heavy
Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man
Of what lady
Is not marriage honorable in a beggar
Is not your lord honorable without marriage
Good morrow sweet Hero
Why how now
Do you speak in the sick tune
I am out of all other tune methinks
Do you sing it and I’ll dance it
O illegitimate construction
These gloves the Count sent me they are an excellent perfume
I am stuffed cousin
Even since you left it
Doth not my wit become me rarely
It is not seen enough you should wear it in your cap
By my troth I am sick
I meant plain holy thistle
You may think perchance that I think you are in love
Nay by 'r Lady I am not such a fool to think what I list nor I list not to think what I can nor indeed I cannot think if I would think my heart out of thinking that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love
Yet Benedick was such another and now is he become a man
He swore he would never marry and yet now in despite of his heart he eats his meat without grudging
And how you may be converted I know not but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do
Not a false gallop
Madam withdraw the Prince the Count Signor Benedick Don John and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church
Help to dress me good coz good Meg good Ursula
What would you with me honest neighbor
Marry this it is sir
Yes in truth it is sir
What is it my good friends
Goodman Verges sir speaks a little off the matter
It pleases your Worship to say so but we are the poor duke’s officers
But truly for mine own part if I were as tedious as a king I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship
All thy tediousness on me ah
Yea an ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis for I hear as good exclamation on your Worship as of any man in the city and though I be but a poor man I am glad to hear it
Gifts that God gives
I must leave you
One word sir
Take their examination yourself and bring it me
I am now in great haste as it may appear unto you
Fare you well
My lord they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband
I am ready
Go good partner go get you to Francis Seacole
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail
We will spare for no wit I warrant you
Here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome
If you swear my lord you shall not be forsworn
I thank you
I am not of many words but I thank you
Please it your Grace lead on
Your hand Leonato
We will go together
Benedick didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato
I noted her not but I looked on her
Is she not a modest young lady
Do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple true judgment
Or would you have me speak after my custom as being a professed tyrant to their sex
No I pray thee speak in sober judgment
Why i' faith methinks she’s too low for a high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise
Only this commendation I can afford her that were she other than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she is I do not like her
Thou thinkest I am in sport
I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her
Come Friar Francis be brief only to the plain form of marriage and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards
No
Lady you come hither to be married to this count
I do
If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoined charge you on your souls to utter it
Know you any Hero
None my lord
Know you any count
I dare make his answer none
O what men dare do
What men may do
What men daily do not knowing what they do
How now interjections
Why then some be of laughing as ah ha he
As freely son as God did give her me
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift
Nothing unless you render her again
Sweet Prince you learn me noble thankfulness  There Leonato take her back again
She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor
Behold how like a maid she blushes here
Oh what authority and show of truth Can cunning sin cover itself withal
Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue
Would you not swear All you that see her that she were a maid By these exterior shows
But she is none
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed
Her blush is guiltiness not modesty
What do you mean my lord
Dear my lord if you in your own proof Have vanquished the resistance of her youth And made defeat of her virginity  I know what you would say if I have known her You will say she did embrace me as a husband And so extenuate the forehand sin
And seemed I ever otherwise to you
Out on thee seeming
Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide
Sweet Prince why speak not you
What should I speak
I stand dishonored that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale
Are these things spoken or do I but dream
Sir they are spoken and these things are true
This looks not like a nuptial
True
O God
Leonato stand I here
Is this the Prince
Is this the Prince’s brother
Is this face Hero’s
Are our eyes our own
All this is so but what of this my lord
Let me but move one question to your daughter And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her bid her answer truly
I charge thee do so as thou art my child
Oh God defend me
how am I beset  What kind of catechizing call you this
To make you answer truly to your name
Is it not Hero
Who can blot that name With any just reproach
Marry that can Hero
Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue
What man was he talked with you yesternight Out at your window betwixt twelve and one
Now if you are a maid answer to this
I talked with no man at that hour my lord
Upon mine honor Myself my brother and this grievèd count Did see her hear her at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed most like a liberal villain Confessed the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret
There is not chastity enough in language Without offense to utter them Thus pretty lady I am sorry for thy much misgovernment
Why how now cousin
wherefore sink you down
Come let us go
These things come thus to light Smother her spirits up
How doth the lady
Dead I think Help uncle  Hero why Hero
Uncle
Signor Benedick
Friar
Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wished for
How now cousin Hero
Yea wherefore should she not
Wherefore
Why doth not every earthly thing Cry shame upon her
Grieved I I had but one
Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame
O one too much by thee
Why had I one
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
Why had I not with charitable hand Took up a beggar’s issue at my gates Who smirchèd thus and mired with infamy I might have said “No part of it is mine This shame derives itself from unknown loins”
Sir sir be patient
For my part I am so attired in wonder I know not what to say
Oh on my soul my cousin is belied
Lady were you her bedfellow last night
No truly not although until last night I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
Confirmed confirmed
I have marked A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness beat away those blushes And in her eye there hath appeared a fire To burn the errors that these princes hold Against her maiden truth
Friar it cannot be
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left Is that she will not add to her damnation A sin of perjury
There is some strange misprision in the princes
Two of them have the very bent of honor And if their wisdoms be misled in this The practice of it lives in John the Bastard Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies
I know not
If they speak but truth of her These hands shall tear her if they wrong her honor The proudest of them shall well hear of it
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find awaked in such a kind Both strength of limb and policy of mind Ability in means and choice of friends To quit me of them throughly
Pause awhile And let my counsel sway you in this case
Your daughter here the princes left for dead
Let her awhile be secretly kept in And publish it that she is dead indeed
Maintain a mourning ostentation And on your family’s old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial
What shall become of this
What will this do
That is some good
She dying as it must so be maintained Upon the instant that she was accused Shall be lamented pitied and excused Of every hearer
So will it fare with Claudio
But if all aim but this be leveled false The supposition of the lady’s death Will quench the wonder of her infamy
And if it sort not well you may conceal her As best befits her wounded reputation In some reclusive and religious life Out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries
Signior Leonato let the friar advise you
And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio Yet by mine honor I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body
Would you buy her that you enquire after her
But speak you this with a sad brow
Or do you play the flouting jack to tell us Cupid is a good hare finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter
Come in what key shall a man take you to go in the song
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter
But I hope you have no intent to turn husband have you
I would scarce trust myself though I had sworn the contrary if Hero would be my wife
Is ’t come to this
In faith hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion
Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you
Tis well consented
Presently away For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure  Come lady die to live
This wedding day Perhaps is but prolonged
Have patience and endure
Lady Beatrice have you wept all this while
Yea and I will weep a while longer
I will not desire that
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged
Ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right her
Is there any way to show such friendship
A very even way but no such friend
May a man do it
It is a man’s office but not yours
I do love nothing in the world so well as you
Is not that strange
As strange as the thing I know not
I am sorry for my cousin
By my sword Beatrice thou lovest me
With no sauce that can be devised to it
I protest I love thee
Why then God forgive me
What offense sweet Beatrice
You have stayed me in a happy hour
I was about to protest I loved you
And do it with all thy heart
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest
Come bid me do anything for thee
Kill Claudio
Ha
Not for the wide world
You kill me to deny it
Tarry sweet Beatrice
I am gone though I am here
There is no love in you
Nay I pray you let me go
Beatrice  In faith I will go
We’ll be friends first
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy
Is Claudio thine enemy
Is he not approved in the height a villain that hath slandered scorned dishonored my kinswoman
Oh that I were a man
What bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancor O God that I were a man
I would eat his heart in the marketplace
Hear me Beatrice  Talk with a man out at a window
A proper saying
Nay but Beatrice  Sweet Hero she is wronged she is slandered she is undone
Beat 
Princes and counties
Surely a princely testimony a goodly count Count Comfect a sweet gallant surely
Oh that I were a man for his sake
Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake
But manhood is melted into curtsies valor into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too
He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie and swears it
I cannot be a man with wishing therefore I will die a woman with grieving
Tarry good Beatrice
By this hand I love thee
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it
Enough I am engaged
I will challenge him
I will kiss your hand and so I leave you
By this hand Claudio shall render me a dear account
Go comfort your cousin
Which be the malefactors
Marry that am I and my partner
Let them come before Master Constable
Yea marry let them come before me
What’s your name friend
Borachio
Pray write down “Borachio” Yours sirrah
I am a gentleman sir and my name is Conrade
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade” Masters do you serve God
Yea sir we hope
How answer you for yourselves
Marry sir we say we are none
A marvelous witty fellow I assure you but I will go about with him Come you hither sirrah a word in your ear
Sir I say to you it is thought you are false knaves
Sir I say to you we are none
Well stand aside 'Fore God they are both in a ale
Have you writ down that they are none
Master Constable you go not the way to examine
You must call forth the watch that are their accusers
Yea marry that’s the eftest way Let the watch come forth
This man said sir that Don John the Prince’s brother was a villain
Write down Prince John a villain
I do not like thy look I promise thee
Marry that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully
Flat burglary as ever was committed
Yea by Mass that it is
What else fellow
What else
This is all
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away
God’s my life where’s the Sexton
Let him write down the Prince’s officer “coxcomb” Come bind them Thou naughty varlet
Away
You are an ass you are an ass
Dost thou not suspect my place
Dost thou not suspect my years
If you go on thus you will kill yourself And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself
I pray thee cease thy counsel Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve
Bring me a father that so loved his child Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine And bid him speak of patience
Therefore give me no counsel
I pray thee peace
I will be flesh and blood For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself
Make those that do offend you suffer too
There thou speak’st reason
Nay I will do so
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied And that shall Claudio know so shall the Prince And all of them that thus dishonor her
Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily
Good e'en good e'en
Good day to both of you
Hear you my lords      We have some haste Leonato
I would your grace would constrain me to tell
Amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy
You speak this to fetch me in my lord
By my troth I speak my thought
Some haste my lord
Well fare you well my lord
Are you so hasty now
Well all is one
Nay do not quarrel with us good old man
If he could right himself with quarreling Some of us would lie low
Who wrongs him
Marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
Nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword
I fear thee not
Marry beshrew my hand If it should give your age such cause of fear
In faith my hand meant nothing to my sword
Tush tush man never fleer and jest at me
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young or what would do Were I not old
Know Claudio to thy head Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by And with gray hairs and bruise of many days Do challenge thee to trial of a man
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart And she lies buried with her ancestors Oh in a tomb where never scandal slept Save this of hers framed by thy villainy
My villainy
Thine Claudio thine I say
You say not right old man
My lord my lord I’ll prove it on his body if he dare Despite his nice fence and his active practice His May of youth and bloom of lustihood
Away
I will not have to do with you
Canst thou so daff me
Thou hast killed my child
If thou kill’st me boy thou shalt kill a man
He shall kill two of us and men indeed But that’s no matter
Let him kill one first
Win me and wear me
Let him answer me  Come follow me boy
Sir boy I’ll whip you from your foining fence Nay as I am a gentleman I will
Brother  Content yourself
God knows I loved my niece And she is dead slandered to death by villains That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue  Boys apes braggarts jacks milksops
Brother Anthony 
Hold you content
But brother Anthony      Come ’tis no matter
Do not you meddle
Let me deal in this
Gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death But on my honor she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof
My lord my lord  I will not hear you
No
Come brother away
I will be heard
And shall or some of us will smart for it
See see here comes the man we went to seek
Now Signior what news
Welcome Signior
You are almost come to part almost a fray
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off with two old men without teeth
Leonato and his brother
What think’st thou
Had we fought I doubt we should have been too young for them
In a false quarrel there is no true valor
As I am an honest man he looks pale Art thou sick or angry
killed a cat
Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care
Sir I shall meet your wit in the career an you charge it against me
I pray you choose another subject
I think he be angry indeed
If he be he knows how to turn his girdle
Shall I speak a word in your ear
God bless me from a challenge
Do me right or I will protest your cowardice
You have killed a sweet lady and her death shall fall heavy on you
Let me hear from you
What a feast a feast
I' faith I thank him
I’ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit he other day
I said thou hadst a fine wit
True” said she “a fine little one” “No” said I “a great wit” “Right” says she “a great gross one” “Nay” said I “a good wit” “Just” said she “it hurts nobody” “Nay” said I “the gentleman is wise” “Certain” said she “a wise gentleman” “Nay” said I “he hath the tongues” “That I believe” said she “for he swore a thing to me on Monday night which he forswore on Tuesday morning there’s a double tongue there’s two tongues” Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues
Yea that she did
But yet for all that an if she did not hate him deadly she would love him dearly
The old man’s daughter told us all
All all
And moreover God saw him when he was hid in the garden
But when shall we set the savage bull’s horns on the sensible Benedick’s head
Yea and text underneath “Here dwells Benedick the married man”
Fare you well boy
You know my mind
I will leave you now to your gossip like humor
You break jests as braggarts do their blades which God be thanked hurt not My lord for your many courtesies I thank you
I must discontinue your company
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina
You have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady
For my Lord Lackbeard there he and I shall meet and till then peace be with him
He is in earnest
In most profound earnest and I’ll warrant you for the love of Beatrice
And hath challenged thee
Most sincerely
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit
He is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to such a man
But soft you let me be
Pluck up my heart and be sad
Did he not say my brother was fled
Come you sir
If justice cannot tame you she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance
Nay an you be a cursing hypocrite once you must be looked to
How now
Two of my brother’s men bound
Officers what offense have these men done
Marry sir they have committed false report moreover they have spoken untruths secondarily they are slanders sixth and lastly they have belied a lady thirdly they have verified unjust things and to conclude they are lying knaves
First I ask thee what they have done thirdly I ask thee what’s their offense sixth and lastly why they are committed and to conclude what you lay to their charge
I have deceived even your very eyes
My villainy they have upon record which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame
The lady is dead upon mine and my master’s false accusation
I have drunk poison whiles he uttered it
Yea and paid me richly for the practice of it
He is composed and framed of treachery And fled he is upon this villainy
Sweet Hero now thy image doth appear In the rare semblance that I loved it first
Here here comes Master Signior Leonato and the Sexton too
Which is the villain
Let me see his eyes That when I note another man like him I may avoid him
Which of these is he
If you would know your wronger look on me
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child
Yea even I alone
No not so villain thou beliest thyself
I know not how to pray your patience Yet I must speak
Choose your revenge yourself
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live  That were impossible but I pray you both Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died
And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones
Sing it tonight
Tomorrow morning come you to my house And since you could not be my son in law Be yet my nephew
My brother hath a daughter Almost the copy of my child that’s dead And she alone is heir to both of us
Give her the right you should have given her cousin And so dies my revenge
That I love her I feel
That she is worthy I know
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will
That a woman conceived me I thank her
That she brought me up I likewise give her most humble thanks
I shall see thee ere I die look pale with love
With anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with love
Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking pick out mine eyes with a ballad maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid
O noble sir
Your overkindness doth wring tears from me
I do embrace your offer and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio
Tomorrow then I will expect your coming
Tonight I take my leave
This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret Who I believe was packed in all this wrong Hired to it by your brother
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth and I praise God for you
God save the foundation
I leave an arrant knave with your Worship which I beseech your Worship to correct yourself for the example of others
God keep your Worship
I wish your Worship well
God restore you to health
Farewell my lords
We look for you tomorrow
We will not fail
Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero
Pray thee sweet Mistress Margaret deserve well at my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice
To have no man come over me
A most manly wit Margaret it will not hurt a woman
And so I pray thee call Beatrice
Well I will call Beatrice to you who I think hath legs
And therefore will come
I mean in singing
Sweet Beatrice wouldst thou come when I called thee
Yea Signior and depart when you bid me
Oh  stay but till then
Only foul words and thereupon I will kiss thee
Foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul breath and foul breath is noisome
Therefore I will depart unkissed
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so forcible is thy wit
But I must tell thee plainly Claudio undergoes my challenge and either I must shortly hear from him or I will subscribe him a coward
And I pray thee now tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me
For them all together which maintained so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them
But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me
Suffer love
A good epithet
I do suffer love indeed for I love thee against my will
In spite of your heart I think
If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps
And how long is that think you
Question why an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum
Therefore is it most expedient for the wise if Don Worm his conscience find no impediment to the contrary to be the trumpet of his own virtues as I am to myself
So much for praising myself who I myself will bear witness is praiseworthy
An now tell me how doth your cousin
Very ill too
Serve God love me and mend
Madam you must come to your uncle
It is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused the Prince and Claudio mightily abused and Don John is the author of all who is fled and gone
Will you come presently
Will you go hear this news Signior
I will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be buried in thy eyes and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle’s
Is this the monument of Leonato
It is my lord
Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies
Death in guerdon of her wrongs Gives her fame which never dies
So the life that died with shame Lives in death with glorious fame
Hang thou there upon the tomb Praising her when I am dumb
Now music sound and sing your solemn hymn
Now unto thy bones good night
Yearly will I do this rite
Good morrow masters
Put your torches out
The wolves have preyed and look the gentle day Before the wheels of Phoebus round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey
Good morrow masters
Did I not tell you she was innocent
So are the Prince and Claudio who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated
Well I am glad that all things sort so well
And so am I being else by faith enforced To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it
Well daughter and you gentlewomen all Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves And when I send for you come hither masked
The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me You know your office brother
You must be father to your brother’s daughter And give her to young Claudio
To do what Signior
That eye my daughter lent her ’tis most true
And I do with an eye of love requite her
The sight whereof I think you had from me From Claudio and the Prince
But what’s your will
Your answer sir is enigmatical
And my help
Here comes the Prince and Claudio
Good morrow to this fair assembly
Good morrow Prince good morrow Claudio
We here attend you
Are you yet determined Today to marry with my brother’s daughter
I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope
Well as time shall try
Well you temporize with the hours
Commend me to him and tell him I will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made great preparation
Call her forth brother
Here’s the friar ready
Good morrow Benedick
I think he thinks upon the savage bull
Tush fear not man
Here comes other reck'nings
Which is the lady I must seize upon
This same is she and I do give you her
No that you shall not till you take her hand Before this friar and swear to marry her
Another Hero
Nothing certainer
One Hero died defiled but I do live And surely as I live I am a maid
The former Hero
Hero that is dead
She died my lord but whiles her slander lived
All this amazement can I qualify When after that the holy rites are ended I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death
Soft and fair Friar Which is Beatrice
Do not you love me
Why no no more than reason
Why then your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived
They swore you did
Do not you love me
Troth no no more than reason
Why then my cousin Margaret and Ursula Are much deceived for they did swear you did
They swore that you were almost sick for me
They swore that you were well nigh dead for me
Tis no such matter
Then you do not love me
No truly but in friendly recompense
Come cousin I am sure you love the gentleman
And here’s another Writ in my cousin’s hand stol'n from her pocket Containing her affection unto Benedick
A miracle
Here’s our own hands against our hearts
Come I will have thee but by this light I take thee for pity
I would not deny you but by this good day I yield upon great persuasion and partly to save your life for I was told you were in a consumption
Peace
I will stop your mouth
How dost thou Benedick the married man
I’ll tell thee what Prince a college of wit crackers cannot flout me out of my humor
Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram
No
First of my word
Therefore play music Prince thou art sad
Get thee a wife get thee a wife
To the tuition of God
From my house if I had it  The sixth of July
My liege your highness now may do me good
My love is thine to teach
Teach it but how And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good
Hath Leonato any son my lord
No child but Hero she’s his only heir
Dost thou affect her Claudio
If thou dost love fair Hero cherish it And I will break with her and with her father And thou shalt have her
Was ’t not to this end That thou began’st to twist so fine a story
But lest my liking might too sudden seem I would have salved it with a longer treatise
What need the bridge much broader than the flood
I will assume thy part in some disguise And tell fair Hero I am Claudio And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart And take her hearing prisoner with the force And strong encounter of my amorous tale
In practice let us put it presently
Hath he provided this music
He is very busy about it
But brother I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of
Are they good
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this
A good sharp fellow
I will send for him and question him yourself
He is very near by this
He was not three leagues off when I left him
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action
But few of any sort and none of name
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers
I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young Florentine called Claudio
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it
No no we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself
But I will acquaint my daughter withal that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true
Go you and tell her of it
Cousins you know what you have to do O I cry you mercy friend
Go you with me and I will use your skill  Good cousin have a care this busy time
What the goodyear my lord why are you thus out of measure sad
Therefore the sadness is without limit
You should hear reason
I cannot hide what I am
Yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment
You have of late stood out against your brother and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself
It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any
In this though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but I am a plain dealing villain
In the meantime let me be that I am and seek not to alter me
Can you make no use of your discontent
I make all use of it for I use it only
Who comes here
What news Borachio
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness
Marry it is your brother’s right hand
Who
The most exquisite Claudio
Even he
Marry on Hero the daughter and heir of Leonato
A very forward March chick
How came you to this
Being entertained for a perfumer as I was smoking a musty room comes me the Prince and Claudio hand in hand in sad conference
Come come let us thither
This may prove food to my displeasure
If I can cross him any way I bless myself every way
You are both sure and will assist me
To the death my lord
Let us to the great supper
We’ll wait upon your lordship
Was not Count John here at supper
I saw him not
How tartly that gentleman looks
I never can see him but I am heartburned an hour after
He is of a very melancholy disposition
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick
The one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too like my lady’s eldest son evermore tattling
Then half Signor Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth and half Count John’s melancholy in Signor Benedick’s face  With a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in his purse such a man would win any woman in the world if he could get her goodwill
By my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
In faith she’s too curst
You may light on a husband that hath no beard
What should I do with him
Well then go you into hell
No but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head and say “Get you to heaven Beatrice get you to heaven here’s no place for you maids” So deliver I up my apes and away to Saint Peter
For the heavens he shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry as the day is long
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth
Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered with a piece of valiant dust
To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
No uncle I’ll none
If the Prince be too important tell him there is measure in everything and so dance out the answer
For hear me Hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig a measure and a cinquepace
Cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly
I have a good eye uncle
I can see a church by daylight
The revelers are entering brother
Make good room
Lady will you walk a bout with your friend
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing I am yours for the walk and especially when I walk away
And when please you to say so
When I like your favor for God defend the lute should be like the case
My visor is Philemon’s roof within the house is Jove
Speak low if you speak love
Well I would you did like me
Which is one
I say my prayers aloud
I love you the better the hearers may cry “Amen” God match me with a good dancer
Amen
No more words
The clerk is answered
At a word I am not
I know you by the waggling of your head
To tell you true I counterfeit him
You could never do him so ill well unless you were the very man
Here’s his dry hand up and down
You are he you are he
At a word I am not
Come come do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit
Can virtue hide itself
Go to mum you are he
Graces will appear and there’s an end
Will you not tell me who told you so
No you shall pardon me
Nor will you not tell me who you are
Not now
That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of The Hundred Merry Tales
Well this was Signor Benedick that said so
What’s he
I am sure you know him well enough
Not I believe me
Did he never make you laugh
In great measure
There are no faces truer than those that are so washed
How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping
There was none such in the army of any sort
What is he that you ask for niece
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua
Oh he’s returned and as pleasant as ever he was
I pray you what is he
Why he is the Prince’s jester a very dull fool only his gift is in devising impossible slanders
I am sure he is in the fleet
I would he had boarded me
When I know the gentleman I’ll tell him what you say
Do do
He’ll but break a comparison or two on me which peradventure not marked or not laughed at strikes him into melancholy and then there’s a partridge wing saved for the fool will eat no supper that night
We must follow the leaders
In every good thing
Nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at the next turning
And that is Claudio
You know me well
I am he
Signor you are very near my brother in his love
He is enamored on Hero
I pray you dissuade him from her
How know you he loves her
I heard him swear his affection
So did I too and he swore he would marry her tonight
Come let us to the banquet
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio
Tis certain so the Prince woos for himself
Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
Let every eye nogetiate for itself And trust no agent for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood
Farewell therefore Hero
Count Claudio
Yea the same
Come will you go with me
Whither
I wish him joy of her
Why that’s spoken like an honest drover so they sell bullocks
But did you think the Prince would have served you thus
I pray you leave me
Ho now you strike like the blind man
Twas the boy that stole your meat and you’ll beat the post
If it will not be I’ll leave you
Alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me and not know me
The Prince’s fool
Ha it may be I go under that title because I am merry
Yea but so I am apt to do myself wrong
I am not so reputed
Well I’ll be revenged as I may
Now Signior where’s the Count
Did you see him
Troth my lord I have played the part of Lady Fame
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren
What’s his fault
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed with finding a birds' nest shows it his companion and he steals it
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression
The transgression is in the stealer
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you
The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you
She speaks poniards and every word stabs
If her breath were as terrible as her terminations there were no living near her she would infect to the north star
I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed
Come talk not of her
Look here she comes
Will your grace command me any service to the world’s end
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on
Marry once before he won it of me with false dice
Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it
You have put him down lady you have put him down
Why how now Count wherefore are you sad
Not sad my lord
How then sick
Neither my lord
The Count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but civil count civil as an orange and something of that jealous complexion
I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained
Name the day of marriage and God give thee joy
Count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes
His grace hath made the match and all grace say “Amen” to it
Speak Count ’tis your cue
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange
In faith lady you have a merry heart
Yea my lord
I thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy side of care
My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart
And so she doth cousin
Good Lord for alliance
Thus goes everyone to the world but I and I am sunburnt
I may sit in a corner and cry “Heigh ho for a husband” Lady Beatrice I will get you one
I would rather have one of your father’s getting
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you
Your father got excellent husbands if a maid could come by them
Will you have me lady
No my lord unless I might have another for working days
Your Grace is too costly to wear every day
But I beseech your Grace pardon me
I was born to speak all mirth and nomatter
Niece will you look to those things I told you of
I cry you mercy uncle By your Grace’s pardon
By my troth a pleasant spirited lady
There’s little of the melancholy element in her my lord
She is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for I have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked herself with laughing
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband
Oh by no means
She mocks all her wooers out of suit
She were an excellent wife for Benedict
O Lord my lord if they were but a week married they would talk themselves mad
County Claudio when mean you to go to church
Tomorrow my lord
My lord I am for you though it cost me ten nights' watchings
And I my lord
And you too gentle Hero
I will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a good husband
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know
Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain of approved valor and confirmed honesty
Go in with me and I will tell you my drift
Faith niece you tax Signor Benedick too much but he’ll be meet with you I doubt it not
He hath done good service lady in these wars
You had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it
And a good soldier too lady
A lord to a lord a man to a man stuffed with all honorable virtues
He is no less than a stuffed man
But for the stuffing well we are all mortal
You must not sir mistake my niece
There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her
They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them
He hath every month a new sworn brother
Is ’t possible
It is so
The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato
Yea my lord but I can cross it
Any bar any cross any impediment will be med'cinable to me
I am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine
How canst thou cross this marriage
Not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me
Show me briefly how
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret the waiting gentlewoman to Hero
I remember
I can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage
The poison of that lies in you to temper
What proof shall I make of that
Proof enough to misuse the Prince to vex Claudio to undo Hero and kill Leonato
Look you for any other issue
Only to despite them I will endeavor anything
Go then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone
Tell them that you know that Hero loves me
Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio as in love of your brother’s honor who hath made this match and his friend’s reputation who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid that you have discovered thus
They will scarcely believe this without trial
Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me
I will presently go learn their day of marriage
Boy
Signior
In my chamber window lies a book
Bring it hither to me in the orchard
I am here already sir
I know that but I would have thee hence and here again
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe
I have known when he would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet
I cannot tell I think not
I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but I’ll take my oath on it till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a fool
Ha
The Prince and Monsieur Love
I will hide me in the arbor
Come shall we hear this music
Yea my good lord
Come Balthasar we’ll hear that song again
O good my lord tax not so bad a voice To slander music anymore than once
I pray thee sing and let me woo no more
Note this before my notes There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting
strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out of men’s bodies
By my troth a good song
And an ill singer my lord
Yea marry dost thou hear Balthasar
I pray thee get us some excellent music for tomorrow night we would have it at the Lady Hero’s chamber window
The best I can my lord
Do so
Farewell
Come hither Leonato
What was it you told me of today that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signor Benedick
Oh ay
sits I did never think that lady would have loved any man
No nor I neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on Signor Benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor
By my troth my lord I cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection it is past the infinite of thought
May be she doth but counterfeit
Faith like enough
O God
Counterfeit
There was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it
Why what effects of passion shows she
What effects my lord
She will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how
She did indeed
How how I pray you
You amaze me
I would have thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection
I would have sworn it had my lord especially against Benedick
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick
No and swears she never will
That’s her torment
Tis true indeed so your daughter says
My daughter tells us all
Now you talk of a sheet of paper I remember a pretty jest your daughter told
Oh when she had writ it and was reading it over she found “Benedick” and “Beatrice” between the sheet
That
O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence railed at herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her
It is very true
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other if she will not discover it
To what end
He would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse
An he should it were an alms to hang him
She’s an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspicion she is virtuous
And she is exceeding wise
Oh my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory
I am sorry for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her guardian
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me
I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself
I pray you tell Benedick of it and hear what he will say
Were it good think you
Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness
She doth well
If she should make tender of her love ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit
He is a very proper man
Before God and in my mind very wise
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit
Very easily possible
I see lady the gentleman is not in your books
No
But I pray you who is his companion
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio
O Lord he will hang upon him like a disease
God help the noble Claudio
If he have caught the Benedick it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured
I will hold friends with you lady
Do good friend
You will never run mad niece
No not till a hot January
Don Pedro is approached
If he do fear God he must necessarily keep peace
If he break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling
Well I am sorry for your niece
Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner
Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me
If it had been painful I would not have come
You take pleasure then in the message
Yea just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and choke a daw withal
You have no stomach Signior
Fare you well
Ha
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner” There’s a double meaning in that
I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me” That’s as much as to say “Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks” If I do not take pity of her I am a villain
If I do not love her I am a Jew
Good Margaret run thee to the parlor
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse Is all of her
Say that thou overheardst us And bid her steal into the pleachèd bower Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun Forbid the sun to enter like favorites Made proud by princes that advance their pride Against that power that bred it
There will she hide her To listen our propose
This is thy office
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone
I’ll make her come I warrant you presently
Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come As we do trace this alley up and down Our talk must only be of Benedick
When I do name him let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit
My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice
Fear you not my part of the dialogue
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely
So says the Prince and my new trothèd lord
And did they bid you tell her of it madam
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it But I persuaded them if they loved Benedick To wish him wrestle with affection And never to let Beatrice know of it
Why did you so
Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon
What’s the matter lieutenant
I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle
Beat me
Dost thou prate rogue
Nay good lieutenant
I pray you sir hold your hand
Let me go sir or I’ll knock you o'er the mazzard
Come come you’re drunk
Drunk
Alas gentlemen  Help ho  Lieutenant sir Montano  Help masters Here’s a goodly watch indeed
Who’s that which rings the bell Diablo ho
The town will rise
Fie Fie lieutenant You’ll be ashamed for ever
What is the matter here
He dies
Hold for your lives
Hold ho
Hold
The general speaks to you
Hold for shame
For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle From her propriety
What is the matter masters  Honest Iago that looks dead with grieving Speak who began this
On thy love I charge thee
I do not know
Swords out and tilting one at other’s breasts In opposition bloody
I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it
Worthy Montano you were wont be civil
What’s the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night brawler
Give me answer to it
Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger
Nor know I aught By me that’s said or done amiss this night Unless self charity be sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us
Now by heaven My blood begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgment collied Assays to lead the way
Tis monstrous
Iago who began ’t
Touch me not so near
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him
When I came back  For this was brief  I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them
More of this matter cannot I report
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass
I’ll make thee an example
What’s the matter dear
All’s well sweeting Come away to bed  Myself will be your surgeon
What are you hurt lieutenant
Ay past all surgery
Marry heaven forbid
But thou must needs be sure My spirits and my place have in their power To make this bitter to thee
Patience good sir
What tell’st thou me of robbing
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse
You’ll have your nephews neigh to you
You’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans
What profane wretch art thou
I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs
Thou art a villain
You are a senator
This thou shalt answer
I know thee Roderigo
Sir I will answer any thing
Reputation reputation reputation
My reputation Iago my reputation
As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound
There is more sense in that than in reputation
You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser
What man there are ways to recover the general again
Sue to him again and he’s yours
Drunk
And speak parrot
And squabble
Swagger
And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow
O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil
What was he that you followed with your sword
What had he done to you
I know not
Is ’t possible
I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly
A quarrel but nothing wherefore
That we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts
Why but you are now well enough
How came you thus recovered
One unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself
Come you are too severe a moraler
As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen
But since it is as it is mend it for your own good
I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard
Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all
To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast
Oh strange
Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil
Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used
Exclaim no more against it
And good lieutenant I think you think I love you
I have well approved it sir
I drunk
You or any man living may be drunk at a time man
I tell you what you shall do
Our general’s wife is now the general
Confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again
She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested
This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before
You advise me well
I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me
I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me
You are in the right
Good night lieutenant I must to the watch
Good night honest Iago
And what’s he then that says I play the villain
When this advice is free I give and honest Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again
For ’tis most easy Th' inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit
She’s framed as fruitful As the free elements
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good
When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now
And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor
So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all
How now Roderigo
My money is almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains
And so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice
How poor are they that have not patience
What wound did ever heal but by degrees
Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on dilatory time
Does’t not go well
In troth ’tis morning
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short
Retire thee go where thou art billeted
Nay get thee gone
Two things are to be done My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress
I’ll set her on
Ay that’s the way
Masters play here I will content your pains
Are these I pray you wind instruments
Ay marry are they sir
Oh thereby hangs a tail
Whereby hangs a tale sir
Well sir we will not
If you have any music that may not be heard to ’t again
But as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care
We have none such sir
Then put up your pipes in your bag for I’ll away
Go vanish into air away
Dost thou hear my honest friend
Prithee keep up thy quillets
She is stirring sir
If she will stir hither I shall seem to notify unto her
In happy time Iago
You have not been abed then
Why no
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access
I humbly thank you for’t
Good morrow good Lieutenant
I am sorry For your displeasure but all will sure be well
The general and his wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly
The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you
But he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again
Yet I beseech you If you think fit or that it may be done Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone
Pray you come in
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely
I am much bound to you
These letters give Iago to the pilot And by him do my duties to the senate
That done I will be walking on the works Repair there to me
Well my good lord I’ll do ’t
This fortification gentlemen shall we see ’t
We’ll wait upon your lordship
Be thou assured good Cassio I will do All my abilities in thy behalf
Good madam do
Do not doubt Cassio But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were
You do love my lord
Ay but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet Or breed itself so out of circumstances That I being absent and my place supplied My general will forget my love and service
My lord shall never rest I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience
But if you know not this my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke
Do not believe That from the sense of all civility I thus would play and trifle with your reverence
If she be in her chamber or your house Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you
Strike on the tinder ho
Give me a taper call up all my people
This accident is not unlike my dream Belief of it oppresses me already
Light I say light
Farewell for I must leave you
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place To be producted (as if I stay I shall) Against the Moor
In which regard
Therefore be merry Cassio For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away
Madam here comes my lord
Madam I’ll take my leave
Why stay and hear me speak
Madam not now
I am very ill at ease Unfit for mine own purposes
Well do your discretion
Ha
I like not that
What dost thou say
Nothing my lord or if I know not what
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife
Cassio my lord
I do believe ’twas he
How now my lord
I have been talking with a suitor here A man that languishes in your displeasure
Who is ’t you mean
Why your lieutenant Cassio
Good my lord If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take
I prithee call him back
Went he hence now
Ay sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him
Good love call him back
Not now sweet Desdemona
Some other time
But shall ’t be shortly
The sooner sweet for you
Shall ’t be tonight at supper
No not tonight
Tomorrow dinner then
Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn
On Tuesday noon or night or Wednesday morn
I prithee name the time but let it not Exceed three days
In faith he’s penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason (Save that they say the wars must make example Out of her best) is not almost a fault T' incur a private check
When shall he come
Tell me Othello
Trust me I could do much  Prithee no more
Let him come when he will I will deny thee nothing
Why this is not a boon 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person
Nay when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted
I will deny thee nothing
Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this To leave me but a little to myself
Shall I deny you
No
Farewell my lord
Farewell my Desdemona
I’ll come to thee straight
Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee
My noble lord  What dost thou say Iago
Did Michael Cassio when you wooed my lady Know of your love
He did from first to last
Why dost thou ask
Why of thy thought Iago
I did not think he had been acquainted with her
Indeed
Indeed
Ay indeed
Discern’st thou aught in that
Is he not honest
Honest my lord
Honest ay honest
My lord for aught I know
What dost thou think
Think my lord
Think my lord” Alas thou echo’st me As if there were some monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shown
Thou dost mean something
I heard thee say even now thou lik’st not that When Cassio left my wife
What didst not like
And when I told thee he was of my counsel Of my whole course of wooing thou cried’st “Indeed” And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit
If thou dost love me Show me thy thought
My lord you know I love you
I think thou dost
For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest
I think so too
Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none
Certain men should be what they seem
Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man
Nay yet there’s more in this
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words
Utter my thoughts
Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts
What dost thou mean
Good name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls
Who steals my purse steals trash
Tis something nothing 'Twas mine ’tis his and has been slave to thousands
But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed
I’ll know thy thoughts
You cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst ’tis in my custody
Ha
Oh beware my lord of jealousy
It is the green eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on
Oh misery
Poor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor
Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy
Why why is this
Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions
No
To be once in doubt Is to be resolved
Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances
Where virtue is these are more virtuous
Therefore as I am bound Receive it from me
I speak not yet of proof
Look to ’t
I know our country disposition well
In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands
Dost thou say so
And so she did
Why go to then
She that so young could give out such a seeming To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak He thought ’twas witchcraft
But I am much to blame
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you
I am bound to thee forever
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits
Not a jot not a jot
Trust me I fear it has
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love
But I do see you’re moved
I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion
I will not
Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aimed not at
Cassio’s my worthy friend  My lord I see you’re moved
No not much moved
Farewell farewell
If more thou dost perceive let me know more
Set on thy wife to observe
Leave me Iago
My lord I take my leave
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
That you shall surely find him Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search And there will I be with him
It is too true an evil
Gone she is
And what’s to come of my despisèd time Is naught but bitterness
Now Roderigo Where didst thou see her Oh unhappy girl  With the Moor say’st thou Who would be a father  How didst thou know ’twas she Oh she deceives me Past thought What said she to you Get more tapers Raise all my kindred
Are they married think you
Truly I think they are
Oh heaven how got she out
Oh treason of the blood
Fathers from hence trust not your daughters' minds By what you see them act
Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused
Have you not read Roderigo Of some such thing
Yes sir I have indeed
I think I can discover him if you please To get good guard and go along with me
With any strong or vehement importunity
Much will be seen in that
In the meantime Let me be thought too busy in my fears  As worthy cause I have to fear I am  And hold her free I do beseech your honor
Fear not my government
I once more take my leave
This fellow’s of exceeding honesty And knows all quantities with a learnèd spirit Of human dealings
If I do prove her haggard Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune
Oh curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites
I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses
Yet ’tis the plague to great ones Prerogatived are they less than the base
Tis destiny unshunnable like death
Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us When we do quicken
Look where she comes
If she be false heaven mocked itself
I’ll not believe ’t
How now my dear Othello
Your dinner and the generous islanders By you invited do attend your presence
I am to blame
Why do you speak so faintly
Are you not well
I have a pain upon my forehead here
Why that’s with watching ’twill away again
Let me but bind it hard within this hour It will be well
Come I’ll go in with you
I am very sorry that you are not well
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Wooed me to steal it but she so loves the token (For he conjured her she should ever keep it) That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to
I’ll have the work ta'en out And give ’t Iago
What he will do with it Heaven knows not I I nothing but to please his fantasy
How now
What do you here alone
Do not you chide
I have a thing for you
A thing for me
It is a common thing  Ha
To have a foolish wife
Oh is that all
What will you give me now For the same handkerchief
What handkerchief
What handkerchief
Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona That which so often you did bid me steal
Hast stolen it from her
No but she let it drop by negligence And to th' advantage I being here took ’t up
Look here it is
A good wench give it me
What will you do with ’t that you have been so earnest To have me filch it
Why what is that to you
If it be not for some purpose of import Give ’t me again
Poor lady she’ll run mad When she shall lack it
Go leave me
The Moor already changes with my poison
Look where he comes
Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday
False to me
I swear ’tis better to be much abused Than but to know ’t a little
How now my lord
What sense had I in her stol'n hours of lust
I saw ’t not thought it not it harmed not me
I slept the next night well fed well was free and merry
I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips
He that is robbed not wanting what is stol'n Let him not know’t and he’s not robbed at all
I am sorry to hear this
I had been happy if the general camp Pioneers and all had tasted her sweet body So I had nothing known
Oh now forever Farewell the tranquil mind
Farewell content
Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue
Oh farewell
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump The spirit stirring drum th' ear piercing fife The royal banner and all quality Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
And O you mortal engines whose rude throats The immortal Jove’s dead clamors counterfeit Farewell
Othello’s occupation’s gone
Is ’t possible my lord
Is ’t come to this
Make me to see ’t or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
Oh heaven forgive me
Are you a man
Have you a soul or sense
God buy you take mine office
O monstrous world
Take note take note O world To be direct and honest is not safe
Nay stay
Thou shouldst be honest
I should be wise for honesty’s a fool And loses that it works for
By the world I think my wife be honest and think she is not
I think that thou art just and think thou art not
I’ll have some proof
Her name that was as fresh As Dian’s visage is now begrimed and black As mine own face
Would I were satisfied
I see sir you are eaten up with passion
I do repent me that I put it to you
You would be satisfied
Would
Nay and I will
And may but how
How satisfied my lord
Would you the supervisor grossly gape on Behold her topped
Death and damnation
Oh
It were a tedious difficulty I think To bring them to that prospect
What shall I say
Where’s satisfaction
It is impossible you should see this Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk
But yet I say If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction you may have ’t
Give me a living reason she’s disloyal
I do not like the office
But sith I am entered in this cause so far Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love I will go on
I lay with Cassio lately And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep
Monstrous
Nay this was but his dream
Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly
I’ll tear her all to pieces
Tell me but this Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand
If it be that  If it be that or any that was hers It speaks against her with the other proofs
Oh that the slave had forty thousand lives
One is too poor too weak for my revenge
Now do I see ’tis true
Swell bosom with thy fraught For ’tis of aspics' tongues
Patience I say
Your mind may change
Never Iago
Now by yon marble heaven In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words
Do not rise yet
Witness you ever burning lights above You elements that clip us round about Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit hands heart To wronged Othello’s service
Let him command And to obey shall be in me remorse What bloody business ever
I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous And will upon the instant put thee to ’t
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio’s not alive
But let her live
Oh damn her damn her
Come go with me apart
I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil
Now art thou my lieutenant
I am your own for ever
Pray you lead on
At every house I’ll call
I will deserve your pains
Why man
Go to
Where lodges he
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie
Can anything be made of this
I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report
Seek him bid him come hither
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
To do this is within the compass of man’s wit and therefore I will attempt the doing it
Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia
I know not madam
Believe me I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes
And but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are it were enough To put him to ill thinking
Is he not jealous
Who he
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him
Look where he comes
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be called to him How is ’t with you my lord
Hot hot and moist
This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
Much castigation exercise devout For here’s a young and sweating devil here That commonly rebels
Tis a good hand A frank one
The hearts of old gave hands But our new heraldry is hands not hearts
I cannot speak of this
Come now your promise
What promise chuck
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
Lend me thy handkerchief
Here my lord
That which I gave you
I have it not about me
Not
No indeed my lord
That’s a fault
The thoughts of people
She told her while she kept it 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love but if she lost it Or made gift of it my father’s eye Should hold her loathèd and his spirits should hunt After new fancies
She dying gave it me And bid me when my fate would have me wived To give it her
I did so and take heed on ’t Make it a darling like your precious eye
Is ’t possible
Tis true
There’s magic in the web of it
A sibyl that had numbered in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses In her prophetic fury sewed the work
The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maidens' hearts
Indeed
Is ’t true
Most veritable therefore look to ’t well
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen ’t
Ha
Wherefore
Why do you speak so startingly and rash
Is ’t lost
Is ’t gone
Speak is ’t out o' th' way
Bless us
Say you
It is not lost but what and if it were
How
I say it is not lost
Pray you let Cassio be received again
Fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives
Come come You’ll never meet a more sufficient man
The handkerchief
Away
Is not this man jealous
I ne'er saw this before
They are all but stomachs and we all but food
To eat us hungerly and when they are full They belch us
Look you Cassio and my husband
There is no other way
Tis she must do ’t And lo the happiness
Go and importune her
So shall I clothe me in a forced content And shut myself up in some other course To fortune’s alms
My lord is not my lord nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor altered
So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech
You must awhile be patient
What I can do I will and more I will Than for myself I dare
Let that suffice you
Is my lord angry
Can he be angry
There’s matter in ’t indeed if he be angry
I prithee do so
Something sure of state Either from Venice or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things Though great ones are their object
Tis even so For let our finger ache and it endues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain
Nay we must think men are not gods Nor of them look for such observances As fit the bridal
Pray heaven it be State matters as you think and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you
Alas the day
I never gave him cause
But jealous souls will not be answered so
They are not ever jealous for the cause But jealous for they’re jealous
It is a monster Begot upon itself born on itself
Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind
Lady amen
I will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout
If I do find him fit I’ll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost
I humbly thank your ladyship
Save you friend Cassio
What make you from home
How is ’t with you my most fair Bianca
Indeed sweet love I was coming to your house
And I was going to your lodging Cassio
What keep a week away
Seven days and nights
Eight score eight hours
And lovers' absent hours More tedious than the dial eightscore times
Oh weary reckoning
O Cassio whence came this
Is ’t come to this
Well well
Go to woman Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth From whence you have them
Why whose is it
I like the work well
Ere it be demanded As like enough it will I would have it copied
Take it and do ’t and leave me for this time
Leave you
Wherefore
I do attend here on the general And think it no addition nor my wish To have him see me womaned
Why I pray you
Not that I love you not
But that you do not love me
I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night
Tis but a little way that I can bring you For I attend here
But I’ll see you soon
Tis very good
I must be circumstanced
Nine or ten times I had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs
Tis better as it is
Nay but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That with the little godliness I have I did full hard forbear him
Let him do his spite
My services which I have done the signiory Shall out tongue his complaints
Will you think so
Think so Iago
What To kiss in private
An unauthorized kiss
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more not meaning any harm
Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm
It is hypocrisy against the devil
So they do nothing ’tis a venial slip
But if I give my wife a handkerchief  What then
She is protectress of her honor too
May she give that
But for the handkerchief  By heaven I would most gladly have forgot it
Thou saidst Oh it comes o'er my memory As doth the raven o'er the infectious house Boding to all he had my handkerchief
Ay what of that
That’s not so good now
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong
He hath my lord but be you well assured No more than he’ll unswear
What hath he said
Why that he did I know not what he did
Lie    With her
With her on her what you will
Lie with her
lie on her
Lie with her that’s fulsome
Handkerchief confessions handkerchief
Noses ears and lips
Is ’t possible
Confess Handkerchief Oh devil  Work on My medicine work
How now Cassio
What’s the matter
This is his second fit
He had one yesterday
Rub him about the temples
No forbear
If not he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness
Look he stirs
Do you withdraw yourself a little while
When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you
How is it general
Have you not hurt your head
Dost thou mock me
Would you would bear your fortune like a man
A hornèd man’s a monster and a beast
Did he confess it
Good sir be a man Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked May draw with you
Your case is better
No let me know And knowing what I am I know what she shall be
Oh thou art wise
Tis certain
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmèd with your grief  A passion most resulting such a man  Cassio came hither
I shifted him away And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy
Bade him anon return and here speak with me The which he promised
For I will make him tell the tale anew Where how how oft how long ago and when He hath and is again to cope your wife
I say but mark his gesture
Marry patience Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen And nothing of a man
Dost thou hear Iago
Will you withdraw
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca A huswife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio as ’tis the strumpet’s plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one
He when he hears of her cannot refrain From the excess of laughter
As he shall smile Othello shall go mad
And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio’s smiles gestures and light behavior Quite in the wrong How do you now lieutenant
Alas poor caitiff
Look how he laughs already
I never knew woman love man so
Alas poor rogue I think indeed she loves me
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
Do you hear Cassio
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er
Go to well said well said
She gives it out that you shall marry her
Do you intend it
Ha ha ha
Do you triumph
I marry her
What
Prithee bear some charity to my wit
Do not think it so unwholesome
Ha ha ha
So so so so
Prithee say true
Well
She is persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise
Iago beckons me
Now he begins the story
She was here even now
She haunts me in every place
I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians and thither comes the bauble and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck  Crying “O dear Cassio” as it were
Ha ha ha
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber
Look where she comes
Tis such another fitchew
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now
I was a fine fool to take it
I must take out the work
A likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there
This is some minx’s token and I must take out the work
How now my sweet Bianca
How now how now
By heaven that should be my handkerchief
If you’ll come to supper tonight you may
If you will not come when you are next prepared for
After her after her
I must she’ll rail in the street else
Will you sup there
Yes I intend so
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice
O Iago
And did you see the handkerchief
Was that mine
Yours by this hand
And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife
She gave it him and he hath given it his whore
I would have him nine years a killing
A fine woman
A fair woman
A sweet woman
Nay you must forget that
Ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight for she shall not live
Oh the world hath not a sweeter creature she might lie by an emperor’s side and command him tasks
Nay that’s not your way
So delicate with her needle an admirable musician
Oh she will sing the savageness out of a bear
Of so high and plenteous wit and invention
She’s the worse for all this
Oh a thousand thousand times and then of so gentle a condition
Ay too gentle
Nay that’s certain
O Iago the pity of it Iago
If you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody
I will chop her into messes
Oh ’tis foul in her
That’s fouler
Get me some poison Iago this night
I’ll not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again This night Iago
Do it not with poison
Strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath contaminated
Good good the justice of it pleases
Very good
And for Cassio let me be his undertaker
You shall hear more by midnight
Excellent good
Those are the raisèd father and his friends
You were best go in
Not I I must be found
My parts my title and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly
Is it they
By Janus I think no
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant
The goodness of the night upon you friends
What is the news
The Duke does greet you general And he requires your haste post haste appearance Even on the instant
What’s the matter think you
Something from Cyprus as I may divine
It is a business of some heat
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another’s heels And many of the consuls raised and met Are at the Duke’s already
You have been hotly called for
When being not at your lodging to be found The Senate hath sent about three several guests To search you out
Tis well I am found by you
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you
What trumpet is that same
I warrant something from Venice
See your wife’s with him
Save you worthy general
The duke and senators of Venice greet you
And what’s the news good cousin Lodovico
I am very glad to see you signior
Welcome to Cyprus
I thank you
How does lieutenant Cassio
Lives sir
Are you sure of that
My lord
He did not call he’s busy in the paper
Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio
A most unhappy one
I would do much T' atone them for the love I bear to Cassio
Fire and brimstone
My lord
Are you wise
What is he angry
Maybe the letter moved him For as I think they do command him home Deputing Cassio in his government
Trust me I am glad on ’t
Indeed
My lord
I am glad to see you mad
Why sweet Othello  I have not deserved this
My lord this would not be believed in Venice Though I should swear I saw ’t
Tis very much
Make her amends she weeps
Oh devil devil
Out of my sight
I will not stay to offend you
Truly an obedient lady
I do beseech your lordship call her back
Mistress
My lord
What would you with her sir
Who I my lord
Ay you did wish that I would make her turn
Sir she can turn and turn and yet go on And turn again
And she can weep sir weep
And she’s obedient as you say obedient Very obedient Proceed you in your tears  Concerning this sir Oh well painted passion  I am commanded home Get you away I’ll send for you anon Sir I obey the mandate And will return to Venice Hence avaunt
Cassio shall have my place
And sir tonight I do entreat that we may sup together
You are welcome sir to Cyprus
Goats and monkeys
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient
He is much changed
Are his wits safe
Is he not light of brain
He’s that he is
I may not breathe my censure What he might be
If what he might he is not I would to heaven he were
Strike his wife
Faith that was not so well
Yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst
Is it his use
Or did the letters work upon his blood And new create his fault
Alas alas
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known
Do but go after And mark how he continues
I am sorry that I am deceived in him
You have seen nothing then
Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
Yes you have seen Cassio and she together
But then I saw no harm and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them
What did they never whisper
Never my lord
Nor send you out o' th' way
Never
To fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
Never my lord
That’s strange
I durst my lord to wager she is honest Lay down my soul at stake
Bid her come hither
Go
She says enough yet she’s a simple bawd That cannot say as much
And yet she’ll kneel and pray I have seen her do ’t
My lord what is your will
Pray chuck come hither
What is your pleasure
Let me see your eyes
Look in my face
What horrible fancy’s this
I understand a fury in your words But not the words
Therefore be double damned Swear thou art honest
Heaven doth truly know it
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
To whom my lord
With whom
How am I false
Ah Desdemona away away away
Am I the motive of these tears my lord
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back Lay not your blame on me
If you have lost him Why I have lost him too
Yet could I bear that too well very well
But there where I have garnered up my heart Where either I must live or bear no life The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up to be discarded thence
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in
Turn thy complexion there Patience thou young and rose lipped cherubin  Ay there look grim as hell
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest
Oh ay as summer flies are in the shambles That quicken even with blowing
O thou weed Who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet That the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne'er been born
Alas what ignorant sin have I committed
Was this fair paper this most goodly book Made to write “whore” upon
What committed
Committed
O thou public commoner
What committed
Impudent strumpet
By heaven you do me wrong
Are you not a strumpet
No as I am a Christian
What not a whore
No as I shall be saved
Is ’t possible
Oh heaven forgive us
I cry you mercy then I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello You mistress That have the office opposite to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hell
You you ay you
We have done our course
There’s money for your pains
I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel
Alas what does this gentleman conceive
How do you madam
Ancient what makes he here
Faith he tonight hath boarded a land carrack
If it prove lawful prize he’s made for ever
I do not understand
He’s married
To who
Here comes another troop to seek for you
It is Brabantio
General be advised He comes to bad intent
Holla
Stand there
Signior it is the Moor
Down with him thief
With who
I have none
Do not talk to me Emilia
Here’s a change indeed
Tis meet I should be used so very meet
How have I been behaved that he might stick The small’st opinion on my least misuse
What is your pleasure madam
How is ’t with you
I cannot tell
Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks
He might have chid me so for in good faith I am a child to chiding
What is the matter lady
Alas Iago my lord hath so bewhored her Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her That true hearts cannot bear it
Am I that name Iago
What name fair lady
Such as she says my lord did say I was
Why did he so
I do not know
I am sure I am none such
Do not weep do not weep
Alas the day
Hath she forsook so many noble matches Her father and her country and her friends To be called “whore”
Would it not make one weep
It is my wretched fortune
Beshrew him for ’t
How comes this trick upon him
Nay heaven doth know
I will be hanged if some eternal villain Some busy and insinuating rogue Some cogging cozening slave to get some office Have not devised this slander
I will be hanged else
Fie there is no such man
It is impossible
If any such there be heaven pardon him
Why should he call her “whore”
Who keeps her company
The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave Some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
O heavens that such companions thou’dst unfold And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to th' west
Speak within door
Oh fie upon them
Some such squire he was That turned your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor
You are a fool
Go to
Alas Iago What shall I do to win my lord again
Good friend go to him
For by this light of heaven I know not how I lost him
Here I kneel If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love Either in discourse of thought or actual deed Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense Delighted them or any other form Or that I do not yet and ever did
And ever will though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement love him dearly Comfort forswear me
Unkindness may do much And his unkindness may defeat my life But never taint my love
I cannot say “whore” It does abhor me now I speak the word
The business of the state does him offence And he does chide with you
If ’twere no other  'Tis but so I warrant
Hark how these instruments summon to supper
The messengers of Venice stays the meat
Go in and weep not
All things shall be well
How now Roderigo
I do not find that thou deal’st justly with me
What in the contrary
I will indeed no longer endure it nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered
Will you hear me Roderigo
I have heard too much and your words and performances are no kin together
You charge me most unjustly
With naught but truth
The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votaress
You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but I find none
Well go to
Very well
Very well” “go to”
I cannot go to man nor ’tis not very well
Nay I think it is scurvy and begin to find myself fopped in it
Very well
I tell you ’tis not very well
I will make myself known to Desdemona
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation
If not assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you
You have said now
Ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing
Why now I see there’s mettle in thee and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before
Give me thy hand Roderigo
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair
It hath not appeared
I grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment
But Roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed which I have greater reason to believe now than ever I mean purpose courage and valor this night show it
If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life
Well what is it
Is it within reason and compass
Sir there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place
Is that true
Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice
How do you mean removing of him
Why by making him uncapable of Othello’s place knocking out his brains
And that you would have me to do
Ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right
He sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will I go to him
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune
If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one) you may take him at your pleasure
I will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall between us
I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him
It is now high suppertime and the night grows to waste
About it
I will hear further reason for this
And you shall be satisfied
I do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further
Madam good night
I humbly thank your ladyship
Your honor is most welcome
Will you walk sir O Desdemona  My lord
Get you to bed on th' instant I will be returned Forthwith
Dismiss your attendant there look ’t be done
I will my lord
How goes it now
He looks gentler than he did
Dismiss me
It was his bidding
Therefore good Emilia Give me my nightly wearing and adieu
We must not now displease him
Ay
Would you had never seen him
So would not I
My love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness his checks his frowns  Prithee unpin me have grace and favor
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
All’s one
Good Father how foolish are our minds
If I do die before thee prithee shroud me In one of these same sheets
Come come
You talk
She had a song of “Willow” An old thing ’twas but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it
That song tonight Will not go from my mind
I have much to do But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poor Barbary
Prithee dispatch
Shall I go fetch your nightgown
No unpin me here
This Lodovico is a proper man
A very handsome man
He speaks well
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip
It’s the wind
Mine eyes do itch Doth that bode weeping
Tis neither here nor there
I have heard it said so
Oh these men these men
Dost thou in conscience think tell me Emilia  That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind
There be some such no question
You Roderigo
Come sir I am for you
Good signior you shall more command with years Than with your weapons
O thou foul thief where hast thou stowed my daughter
Damned as thou art thou hast enchanted her
Judge me the world if ’tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion
If he do resist Subdue him at his peril
Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
Why would not you
No by this heavenly light
Nor I neither by this heavenly light
I might do ’t as well i' th' dark
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
The world’s a huge thing
It is a great price for a small vice
In troth I think thou wouldst not
In troth I think I should and undo ’t when I had done
Marry I would not do such a thing for a joint ring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition
But for the whole world
Why who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch
I should venture purgatory for ’t
Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong For the whole world
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' th' world and having the world for your labor ’tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right
I do not think there is any such woman
Yes a dozen and as many to th' vantage as would store the world they played for
But I do think it is their husbands' faults If wives do fall
Say that they slack their duties
Why we have galls and though we have some grace Yet have we some revenge
Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them
They see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour As husbands have
I think it is
And doth affection breed it
I think it doth
Is ’t frailty that thus errs
It is so too
And have not we affections Desires for sport and frailty as men have
Then let them use us well else let them know The ills we do their ills instruct us so
Good night good night
Heaven me such uses send Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend
Here stand behind this bulk straight will he come
Quick quick
Fear nothing
I’ll be at thy elbow
It makes us or it mars us
Here at thy hand
Be bold and take thy stand
I have no great devotion to the deed And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons
Tis but a man gone
I know his gait ’tis he Villain thou diest
Oh I am slain
I am maimed for ever
Help ho
Murder
Murder
The voice of Cassio
Iago keeps his word
Oh villain that I am
It is even so
Oh help ho
Light
A surgeon
Tis he
Oh brave Iago honest and just That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong
Thou teachest me
Minion your dear lies dead And your unblest fate hies
Strumpet I come
For of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted
Thy bed lust stained shall with lust’s blood be spotted
What ho
No watch
No passage
Murder
Murder
Tis some mischance the cry is very direful
Oh help
Hark
Oh wretched villain
Two or three groan
Tis heavy night These may be counterfeits
Let’s think ’t unsafe To come in to the cry without more help
Nobody come
Then shall I bleed to death
Hark
Here’s one comes in his shirt with light and weapons
Who’s there
Whose noise is this that ones on murder
We do not know
Do not you hear a cry
Here here
For heaven’s sake help me
The same indeed a very valiant fellow
Iago
Oh I am spoiled undone by villains
Give me some help
Oh me lieutenant
What villains have done this
I think that one of them is hereabout And cannot make away
That’s one of them
O damned Iago
O inhuman dog
Kill men i' th' dark
Where be these bloody thieves
Are you of good or evil
As you shall prove us praise us
Signior Lodovico
He sir
I cry you mercy
Here’s Cassio hurt by villains
Cassio
How is ’t brother
My leg is cut in two
Marry heaven forbid
Light gentlemen I’ll bind it with my shirt
What is the matter ho
Who is ’t that cried
Who is ’t that cried
Oh my dear Cassio
My sweet Cassio
O Cassio Cassio Cassio
O notable strumpet
Cassio may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you
No
I am sorry to find you thus
I have been to seek you
Alas he faints
O Cassio Cassio Cassio
Gentlemen all I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury  Patience awhile good Cassio Come come Lend me a light
Know we this face or no
Even he sir
Did you know him
Know him
Ay
I am glad to see you
How do you Cassio Oh a chair a chair
Roderigo
He he ’tis he
Oh that’s well said the chair
Some good man bear him carefully from hence
I’ll fetch the general’s surgeon  Save you your labor He that lies slain here Cassio Was my dear friend
What malice was between you
None in the world nor do I know the man
I pray you look upon her
Do you see gentlemen
Nay guiltiness Will speak though tongues were out of use
Alas what is the matter
What is the matter husband
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark By Roderigo and fellows that are ’scaped
He’s almost slain and Roderigo dead
Alas good gentleman
Alas good Cassio
This is the fruits of whoring
Prithee Emilia Go know of Cassio where he supped tonight 
He supped at my house but I therefore shake not
Oh did he so
I charge you go with me
Oh fie upon thee strumpet
As I
Fie upon thee
Kind gentlemen let’s go see poor Cassio dressed  Come mistress you must tell ’s another tale
Emilia run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happed  Will you go on afore
This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied Whose messengers are here about my side Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him
Tis true most worthy signior
The Duke’s in council and your noble self I am sure is sent for
The Duke in council
In this time of the night
Bring him away
Mine’s not an idle cause
The Duke himself Or any of my brothers of the state Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own
For if such actions may have passage free Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be
Let me not name it to you you chaste stars It is the cause
Yet I’ll not shed her blood Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster
Yet she must die else she’ll betray more men
Put out the light and then put out the light
If I quench thee thou flaming minister I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me
When I have plucked thy rose I cannot give it vital growth again It must needs wither
Who’s there
Othello
Ay Desdemona
Will you come to bed my lord
Ay my lord
Alack my lord what do you mean by that
Well do it and be brief
I will walk by
I would not kill thy unpreparèd spirit
No heavens forfend I would not kill thy soul
Talk you of killing
Ay I do
Then heaven Have mercy on me
Amen with all my heart
If you say I hope you will not kill me
Humh
Why I should fear I know not Since guiltiness I know not
But yet I feel I fear
Think on thy sins
They are loves I bear to you
Ay and for that thou diest
That death’s unnatural that kills for loving
Alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame
These are portents but yet I hope I hope They do not point on me
I will so
What’s the matter
That handkerchief Which I so loved and gave thee thou gav’st To Cassio
No by my life and soul
Send for the man and ask him
Thou art on thy deathbed
Ay but not yet to die
Presently
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin For to deny each article with oath Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal
Thou art to die
Oh heaven have mercy on me
I say “amen”
And have you mercy too
I never gave him token
By heaven I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand
O perjured woman thou dost stone my heart And mak’st me call what I intend to do A murder which I thought a sacrifice
I saw the handkerchief
He hath confessed
What my lord
That he hath usèd thee
How
Ay
He will not say so
No his mouth is stopped
Honest Iago Hath ta'en order for ’t
What is he dead
Had all his hairs been lives My great revenge had stomach for them all
Alas he is betrayed and I undone
Oh banish me my lord but kill me not
Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
Nay if you strive  But half an hour
But while I say one prayer
It is too late
What noise is this Not dead
Not yet quite dead
Who’s there
Yes ’tis Emilia  'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death The noise was high
What’s the matter with thee now
But now my lord
Cassio my lord hath killed a young Venetian Called Roderigo
Roderigo killed
And Cassio killed
No Cassio is not killed
Not Cassio killed
Then murder’s out of tune And sweet revenge grows harsh
Oh falsely falsely murdered
Alas what cry is that
That
What
Out and alas that was my lady’s voice
Help
Help ho help
O lady speak again
Sweet Desdemona
O sweet mistress speak
A guiltless death I die
Oh who hath done this deed
Nobody
I myself
Commend me to my kind lord
Oh farewell
Why how should she be murdered
Alas who knows
You heard her say herself it was not I
She said so
I must needs report the truth
She’s like a liar gone to burning hell
Twas I that killed her
Oh the more angel she And you the blacker devil
She turned to folly and she was a whore
Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
She was false as water
Oh she was heavenly true
Cassio did top her ask thy husband else
Oh I were damned beneath all depth in hell But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity
Thy husband knew it all
My husband
Thy husband
That she was false to wedlock
Ay with Cassio
Had she been true If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite I’d not have sold her for it
My husband
Ay ’twas he that told me on her first
An honest man he is and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds
My husband
What needs this iterance woman
I say thy husband
O mistress villainy hath made mocks with love
My husband say that she was false
He woman
I say “thy husband” dost understand the word
My friend thy husband honest honest Iago
If he say so may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day
He lies to th' heart
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain
Ha
Do thy worst
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her
Peace you were best
O gull
O dolt
As ignorant as dirt
Thou hast done a deed  I care not for thy sword I’ll make thee known
The Moor hath killed my mistress
Murder murder
What is the matter
How now general
Oh are you come Iago
You have done well That men must lay their murders on your neck
What is the matter
I told him what I thought and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true
But did you ever tell him she was false
I did
You told a lie an odious damnèd lie
Upon my soul a lie a wicked lie
She false with Cassio
Did you say with Cassio
With Cassio mistress
Go to charm your tongue
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed  Oh heavens forfend
There’s no composition in this news That gives them credit
Indeed they are disproportioned
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys
And mine a hundred and forty
And mine two hundred
But though they jump not on a just account  As in these cases where the aim reports 'Tis oft with difference yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus
Nay it is possible enough to judgment
A messenger from the galleys
And your reports have set the murder on
I thought so then I’ll kill myself for grief
Oh villainy villainy
What are you mad
I charge you get you home
Good gentlemen let me have leave to speak
Tis proper I obey him but not now
Perchance Iago I will ne'er go home
Oh
Oh
Oh
Nay lay thee down and roar For thou hast killed the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye
Oh she was foul  I scarce did know you uncle
I am glad thy father’s dead Thy match was mortal to him and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain
Did he live now
This sight would make him do a desperate turn Yea curse his better angel from his side And fall to reprobation
Tis pitiful but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed
Zounds hold your peace
Let heaven and men and devils let them all All all cry shame against me yet I’ll speak
Be wise and get you home
I will not
Fie
Your sword upon a woman
O thou dull Moor
That handkerchief thou speak’st of I found by fortune and did give my husband
For often with a solemn earnestness  More than indeed belonged to such a trifle  He begged of me to steal it
Villainous whore
She give it Cassio
No alas I found it And I did give ’t my husband
Filth thou liest
By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen  O murderous coxcomb
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder Precious villain
Sure he hath killed his wife
Ay ay
Oh lay me by my mistress' side
He’s gone but his wife’s killed
Let him not pass But kill him rather
But why should honor outlive honesty
Let it go all
What did thy song bode lady
Hark canst thou hear me
I will play the swan
And die in music
Oh here it is
Uncle I must come forth
Look in upon me then and speak with me Or naked as I am I will assault thee
What is the matter
Behold I have a weapon
That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop
But oh vain boast
Who can control his fate
tis not so now
Be not afraid though you do see me weaponed
Here is my journey’s end here is my butt And very sea mark of my utmost sail
Do you go back dismayed
tis a lost fear
Where should Othello go  Now how dost thou look now
O ill starred wench Pale as thy smock
When we shall meet at compt This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven And fiends will snatch at it
Cold cold my girl Even like thy chastity
O cursed cursed slave
Whip me ye devils From the possession of this heavenly sight
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man
That’s he that was Othello
Here I am
Where is that viper
Bring the villain forth
I take it much unkindly That thou Iago who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine shouldst know of this
Sblood but you’ll not hear me
Thou told’st me Thou didst hold him in thy hate
Despise me If I do not
I look down towards his feet but that’s a fable
If that thou be’st a devil I cannot kill thee
Wrench his sword from him
I bleed sir but not killed
I am not sorry neither
I’d have thee live For in my sense ’tis happiness to die
Why anything
This wretch hath part confessed his villainy
Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death
Ay
Dear general I never gave you cause
I do believe it and I ask your pardon
Will you I pray demand that demi devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
Demand me nothing
What you know you know
From this time forth I never will speak word
What not to pray
Well thou dost best
The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo
Oh villain
Most heathenish and most gross
O thou pernicious caitiff
How came you Cassio by that handkerchief That was my wife’s
I found it in my chamber And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire
Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus
For this slave If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long It shall be his
You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state Come bring him away
Nothing extenuate Nor set down aught in malice
Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well
Of one not easily jealous but being wrought Perplexed in the extreme
Of one whose hand Like the base Indian threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe
Set you down this
And say besides that in Aleppo once Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state I took by the throat the circumcisèd dog And smote him thus
Oh bloody period
All that is spoke is marred
This did I fear but thought he had no weapon For he was great of heart
How say you by this change
This cannot be By no assay of reason
Tis a pageant To keep us in false gaze
Here is more news
Ay so I thought
How many as you guess
Of thirty sail
And now they do re stem Their backward course bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus
Signior Montano Your trusty and most valiant servitor With his free duty recommends you thus And prays you to believe him
Tis certain then for Cyprus
Marcus Luccicos is not he in town
He’s now in Florence
Write from us to him
Post post haste dispatch
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor
Good your grace pardon me
Why what’s the matter
My daughter
Oh my daughter
Dead
Ay to me
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter After your own sense yea though our proper son Stood in your action
Humbly I thank your grace
We are very sorry for’t
Nothing but this is so
The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent no more
More than pertains to feats of broils and battle And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself
A maiden never bold Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself
Against all rules of nature and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be
I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram conjured to this effect He wrought upon her
But Othello speak
Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth
And let her speak of me before her father
Fetch Desdemona hither
You best know the place
And till she come as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I’ll present How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love And she in mine
Say it Othello
Her father loved me oft invited me Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year the battles sieges fortunes That I have passed
These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline
She wished she had not heard it yet she wished That heaven had made her such a man
She thanked me And bade me if I had a friend that loved her I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her
Upon this hint I spake
She loved me for the dangers I had passed And I loved her that she did pity them
This only is the witchcraft I have used
Here comes the lady
Let her witness it
I think this tale would win my daughter too
I pray you hear her speak
If she confess that she was half the wooer Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man Come hither gentle mistress
Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience
My noble father I do perceive here a divided duty
To you I am bound for life and education
You are the lord of duty
I am hitherto your daughter
I have done
Please it your grace on to the state affairs
I had rather to adopt a child than get it  Come hither Moor
I here do give thee that with all my heart Which but thou hast already with all my heart I would keep from thee
For thy escape would teach me tyranny To hang clogs on them I have done my lord
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which as a grise or step may help these lovers
I humbly beseech you proceed to th' affairs of state
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus
Why at her father’s
I’ll not have it so
Nor I
Most gracious Duke To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice T' assist my simpleness
What would you Desdemona
That I did love the Moor to live with him My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world
I saw Othello’s visage in his mind And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate
Let me go with him
Let her have your voice
Be it as you shall privately determine Either for her stay or going
Th' affair cries haste And speed must answer it
You must away tonight
With all my heart
At nine i' th' morning here we’ll meet again
Othello leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you And such things else of quality and respect As doth import you
To his conveyance I assign my wife With what else needful your good grace shall think To be sent after me
Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he
Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership
Why there’s no remedy
Tis the curse of service
Now sir be judge yourself Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor
I would not follow him then
O sir content you
I follow him to serve my turn upon him
We cannot all be masters nor all masters Cannot be truly followed
You shall mark Many a duteous and knee crooking knave That (doting on his own obsequious bondage) Wears out his time much like his master’s ass For naught but provender and when he’s old cashiered
Whip me such honest knaves
These fellows have some soul
Let it be so
Use Desdemona well
Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see
She has deceived her father and may thee
My life upon her faith Honest Iago My Desdemona must I leave to thee
I prithee let thy wife attend on her And bring them after in the best advantage
Come Desdemona I have but an hour Of love of worldly matter and direction To spend with thee
We must obey the time
Iago
What say’st thou noble heart
What will I do think’st thou
Why go to bed and sleep
I will incontinently drown myself
If thou dost I shall never love thee after
Why thou silly gentleman
Oh villainous
I have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen I would change my humanity with a baboon
What should I do
I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it
Virtue
A fig
Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus
Our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners
So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost'rous conclusions
But we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts
It cannot be
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will
Come be a man
Drown thyself
Drown cats and blind puppies
I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness
I could never better stead thee than now
Put money in thy purse
These Moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money
The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida
She must change for youth
Therefore put money in thy purse
If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning
Make all the money thou canst
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her
A pox of drowning thyself
Tis clean out of the way
Thou art sure of me
Go make money
I have told thee often and I re tell thee again and again I hate the Moor
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him
Traverse go provide thy money
We will have more of this tomorrow
Adieu
Where shall we meet i' th' morning
At my lodging
I’ll be with thee betimes
No more of drowning do you hear
I am changed
Go to farewell
Put money enough in your purse
I’ll sell all my land
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse
For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit
I hate the Moor And it is thought abroad that ’twixt my sheets He’s done my office
I know not if ’t be true But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety
He holds me well
Cassio’s a proper man
Let me see now
To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery
How
How
Let’s see
I have ’t
What from the cape can you discern at sea
Nothing at all
It is a high wrought flood
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements
What shall we hear of this
A segregation of the Turkish fleet
For do but stand upon the foaming shore The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds The wind shaked surge with high and monstrous mane Seems to cast water on the burning bear And quench the guards of th' ever fixèd pole
I never did like molestation view On the enchafèd flood
If that the Turkish fleet Be not ensheltered and embayed they are drowned
It is impossible they bear it out
News lads Our wars are done
The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks That their designment halts
A noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance On most part of their fleet
How
Is this true
Michael Cassio Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello Is come on shore
The Moor himself at sea And is in full commission here for Cyprus
I am glad on ’t
Tis a worthy governor
For they were parted With foul and violent tempest
Pray heavens he be For I have served him and the man commands Like a full soldier
Come let’s do so
For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance
Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor
Oh let the heavens Give him defense against the elements For I have lost him on a dangerous sea
Is he well shipped
His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance Therefore my hopes not surfeited to death Stand in bold cure
What noise
I pray you sir go forth And give us truth who ’tis that is arrived
I shall
But good lieutenant is your general wived
Tis one Iago ancient to the general
What is she
Oh behold The riches of the ship is come on shore
You men of Cyprus let her have your knees
Hail to thee lady and the grace of heaven Before behind thee and on every hand Enwheel thee round
I thank you valiant Cassio
What tidings can you tell me of my lord
He is not yet arrived
Nor know I aught But that he’s well and will be shortly here
Oh but I fear
How lost you company
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship  But hark
See for the news
For sir It is as sure as you are Roderigo Were I the Moor I would not be Iago
I am not what I am
Do with like timorous accent and dire yell As when by night and negligence the fire Is spied in populous cities
What ho Brabantio
Signior Brabantio ho
Thieves
Thieves
Look to your house your daughter and your bags
Thieves
thieves
Sir would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me You’ll have enough
I find it still when I have leave to sleep
Marry before your ladyship I grant She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking
You have little cause to say so
Come on come on
You are pictures out of door bells in your parlors wild cats in your kitchens saints in your injuries devils being offended players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds
Oh fie upon thee slanderer
Nay it is true or else I am a Turk
You rise to play and go to bed to work
No let me not
What wouldst thou write of me if thou should’st praise me
O gentle lady do not put me to ’t For I am nothing if not critical
Come on assay
Ay madam
I am not merry but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise
Come how wouldst thou praise me
Well praised
If she be black and thereto have a wit She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit
Worse and worse
How if fair and foolish
Oh heavy ignorance
Thou praisest the worst best
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself
She that was ever fair and never proud Had tongue at will and yet was never loud Never lacked gold and yet went never gay Fled from her wish and yet said “Now I may” She that being angered her revenge being nigh Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind See suitors following and not look behind She was a wight if ever such wights were  To do what
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer
Oh most lame and impotent conclusion
Do not learn of him Emilia though he be thy husband
How say you Cassio
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor
He speaks home madam
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar
I know his trumpet
Tis truly so
Let’s meet him and receive him
Lo where he comes
Oh my fair warrior
My dear Othello
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me
Oh my soul’s joy
If it were now to die 'Twere now to be most happy for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate
The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow
Amen to that sweet powers
I cannot speak enough of this content
It stops me here it is too much of joy
Come let us to the castle
News friends
Our wars are done the Turks are drowned
How does my old acquaintance of this isle  Honey you shall be well desired in Cyprus I have found great love amongst them
Bring thou the master to the citadel
He is a good one and his worthiness Does challenge much respect Come Desdemona Once more well met at Cyprus
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor Come hither
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard
First I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him
With him
Why ’tis not possible
Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed
All which the Moor is defective in
Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does
Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after
I cannot believe that in her
She’s full of most blessed condition
The wine she drinks is made of grapes
If she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor
Blessed pudding
Didst not mark that
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together
Pish
But sir be you ruled by me
I have brought you from Venice
Watch you tonight for the command I’ll lay ’t upon you
Cassio knows you not
I’ll not be far from you
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favorably minister
Well
Sir he’s rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you
Provoke him that he may
For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio
I will do this if you can bring it to any opportunity
I warrant thee
Meet me by and by at the citadel
I must fetch his necessaries ashore
Farewell
Adieu
The thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him wife for wife
Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment cannot cure
For besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial
So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed
All offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven
Bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello
Iago is most honest
Michael good night
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you  Come my dear love The purchase made the fruits are to ensue That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you
Good night
Welcome Iago
We must to the watch
Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame
What is the reason of this terrible summons
What is the matter there
Signior is all your family within
Are your doors locked
Why wherefore ask you this
Zounds sir you’re robbed
For shame put on your gown
Your heart is burst you have lost half your soul
Even now now very now an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe
Arise arise Awake the snorting citizens with the bell Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you
Arise I say
What have you lost your wits
Most reverend signior do you know my voice
Not I
What are you
My name is Roderigo
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee
Sir sir sir 
Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature
What an eye she has
An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
And when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
She is indeed perfection
Well happiness to their sheets
Not tonight good Iago
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment
Oh they are our friends
But one cup
I’ll drink for you
I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here
What man ’tis a night of revels
The gallants desire it
Where are they
Here at the door
I pray you call them in
I’ll do ’t but it dislikes me
If I can fasten but one cup upon him With that which he hath drunk tonight already He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog
Now ’mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle
But here they come
If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely both with wind and stream
Fore heaven they have given me a rouse already
Good faith a little one not past a pint As I am a soldier
Some wine ho
Fore heaven an excellent song
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting
Your Dane your German and your swag bellied Hollander Drink ho are nothing to your English
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking
Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your Almain
To the health of our general
I am for it lieutenant and I’ll do you justice
Oh sweet England
Why this is a more exquisite song than the other
Will you hear ’t again
No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things
Well heaven’s above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved
It’s true good lieutenant
For mine own part no offence to the general nor any man of quality I hope to be saved
And so do I too lieutenant
Ay but (by your leave) not before me
The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient
Let’s have no more of this let’s to our affairs Forgive us our sins Gentlemen let’s look to our business
Do not think gentlemen I am drunk
I am not drunk now
I can stand well enough and I speak well enough
Excellent well
Why very well then
You must not think then that I am drunk
Tis pity of him
But is he often thus
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep
He’ll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle
It were well The general were put in mind of it
Is not this true
And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity
It were an honest action to say So to the Moor
Why so
Now have I done a good day’s work
You peers continue this united league
Dissemble not your hatred
Swear your love
And with my hand I seal my true heart’s love
And I as I love Hastings with my heart
You have been factious one against the other  Wife love Lord Hastings
Dorset embrace him Hastings love Lord Marquess
This interchange of love I here protest Upon my part shall be inviolable
And so swear I
Now princely Buckingham seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife’s allies And make me happy in your unity
A pleasing cordial princely Buckingham Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
And in good time Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen And princely peers a happy time of day
Happy indeed as we have spent the day
A blessèd labor my most sovereign lord
Tis death to me to be at enmity I hate it and desire all good men’s love
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter
I would to God all strifes were well compounded
My sovereign lord I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace
Why madam have I offered love for this To be so flouted in this royal presence
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead
Who knows not he is dead
Who knows he is
All seeing heaven what a world is this
Look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest
Is Clarence dead
The order was reversed
But he poor man by your first order died And that a wingèd Mercury did bear
Some tardy cripple bear the countermand That came too lag to see him burièd
God grant that some less noble and less loyal Nearer in bloody thoughts and not in blood Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did And yet go current from suspicion
I prithee peace
My soul is full of sorrow
I will not rise unless your Highness hear me
Then say at once what is it thou requests
The forfeit sovereign of my servant’s life Who slew today a riotous gentleman Lately attendant on the duke of Norfolk
We know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey
We are the queen’s abjects and must obey  Brother farewell
I know it pleaseth neither of us well
Well your imprisonment shall not be long
I will deliver you or else lie for you
Meantime have patience
I must perforce
Farewell
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return
Simple plain Clarence I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven If heaven will take the present at our hands
But who comes here
Good time of day unto my gracious lord
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain
Well are you welcome to the open air
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment
My brother killed no man his fault was thought And yet his punishment was bitter death
Who sued to me for him
This is the fruits of rashness
Marked you not How that the guilty kindred of the queen Looked pale when they did hear of Clarence' death
O they did urge it still unto the king
God will revenge it
Come lords will you go To comfort Edward with our company
We wait upon your Grace
Good grandam tell us is our father dead
No boy
My pretty cousins you mistake me both
Then you conclude my grandam he is dead
The king mine uncle is to blame for it
God will revenge it whom I will importune With earnest prayers all to that effect
And so will I
Peace children peace
The king doth love you well
Incapable and shallow innocents You cannot guess who caused your father’s death
Think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
Ay boy
I cannot think it
Hark what noise is this
I’ll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy
Why grow the branches when the root is gone
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap
If you will live lament
If die be brief That our swift wingèd souls may catch the king’s Or like obedient subjects follow him To his new kingdom of ne'er changing night
O what cause have I Thine being but a moiety of my moan To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes That I being governed by the watery moon May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
Ah for my husband for my dear lord Edward
Ah for our father for our dear lord Clarence
Alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence
What stay had I but Edward
And he’s gone
What stay had we but Clarence
And he’s gone
And they are gone
Was never widow had so dear a loss
Were never orphans had so dear a loss
Was never mother had so dear a loss
Alas I am the mother of these griefs
She for an Edward weeps and so do I I for a Clarence weep so doth not she
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I I for an Edward weep so do not they
Madam bethink you like a careful mother Of the young prince your son
In him your comfort lives
Sister have comfort
All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star But none can help our harms by wailing them  Madam my mother I do cry you mercy I did not see your Grace
Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing
God bless thee and put meekness in thy breast Love charity obedience and true duty
You cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan Now cheer each other in each other’s love
Though we have spent our harvest of this king We are to reap the harvest of his son
The broken rancor of your high swoll'n hates But lately splintered knit and joined together Must gently be preserved cherished and kept
Meseemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet Hither to London to be crowned our king
Why “with some little train” my Lord of Buckingham
I hope the king made peace with all of us And the compact is firm and true in me
And so in me and so I think in all
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince
And so say I
My lord whoever journeys to the prince For God’s sake let not us two at home
For by the way I’ll sort occasion As index to the story we late talked of To part the queen’s proud kindred from the prince
My other self my council’s consistory My oracle my prophet my dear cousin I as a child will go by thy direction Toward Ludlow then for we’ll not stay behind
Good morrow neighbor whither away so fast
I promise you I scarcely know myself
Hear you the news abroad
Yes that the king is dead
Neighbors God speed
Give you good morrow sir
Doth this news hold of good King Edward’s death
Ay sir it is too true God help the while
Then masters look to see a troublous world
No no by God’s good grace his son shall reign
Woe to the land that’s governed by a child
In him there is a hope of government Which in his nonage council under him And in his full and ripened years himself No doubt shall then and till then govern well
With patience noble lord as prisoners must
More pity that the eagle should be mewed While kites and buzzards prey at liberty
What news abroad
Tis very grievous to be thought upon
Where is he in his bed
He is
Go you before and I will follow you
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crowned in Paris but at nine months old
Stood the state so
Better it were they all came by his father Or by the father there were none at all For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not
O full of danger is the duke of Gloucester And the queen’s sons and brothers haught and proud And were they to be ruled and not to rule This sickly land might solace as before
Come come we fear the worst
All will be well
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth
All may be well but if God sort it so 'Tis more than we deserve or I expect
Before the days of change still is it so
But leave it all to God
Whither away
Marry we were sent for to the justices
Tomorrow or next day they will be here
I long with all my heart to see the prince
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him
Ay mother but I would not have it so
Why my young cousin
It is good to grow
Grandam one night as we did sit at supper My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother “Ay” quoth my uncle Gloucester “Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace” And since methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste
Good faith good faith the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee
He was the wretched’st thing when he was young So long a growing and so leisurely That if this rule were true he should be gracious
And so no doubt he is my gracious madam
I hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
Now by my troth if I had been remembered I could have given my uncle’s grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine
How my pretty York
I prithee let me hear it
Marry they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth
Grandam this would have been a biting jest
I prithee pretty York who told thee this
Grandam his nurse
His nurse
Why she was dead ere thou wast born
If ’twere not she I cannot tell who told me
A parlous boy
Go to you are too shrewd
Good madam be not angry with the child
Pitchers have ears
Here comes a messenger
What news
Such news my lord as grieves me to report
How doth the prince
Well madam and in health
What is thy news then
The mighty dukes Gloucester and Buckingham
For what offence
The sum of all I can I have disclosed
Why or for what the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me my gracious lord
Ay me
I see the ruin of my house
Welcome destruction blood and massacre
My husband lost his life to get the crown And often up and down my sons were tossed For me to joy and weep their gain and loss
O preposterous And frantic outrage end thy damnèd spleen Or let me die to look on death no more
The weary way hath made you melancholy
No uncle but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome me
Those uncles which you want were dangerous
Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts
God keep you from them and from such false friends
God keep me from false friends but they were none
My lord the mayor of London comes to greet you
God bless your Grace with health and happy days
Fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no
And in good time here comes the sweating lord
Welcome my lord
What will our mother come
On what occasion God He knows not I The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary
The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace But by his mother was perforce withheld
Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age You break not sanctuary in seizing him
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men But sanctuary children ne'er till now
My lord you shall o'errule my mind for once  Come on Lord Hastings will you go with me
I go my lord
Good lords make all the speedy haste you may
Say uncle Gloucester if our brother come Where shall we sojourn till our coronation
Where it seems best unto your royal self
I do not like the Tower of any place  Did Julius Caesar build that place my lord
He did my gracious lord begin that place Which since succeeding ages have re edified
Is it upon record or else reported Successively from age to age he built it
Upon record my gracious lord
But say my lord it were not registered Methinks the truth should live from age to age As ’twere retailed to all posterity Even to the general all ending day
What say you uncle
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror For now he lives in fame though not in life
He cannot live I hope and must not die Till George be packed with post horse up to heaven
For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter
What though I killed her husband and her father
The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father The which will I not all so much for love As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto
But yet I run before my horse to market
Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns
When they are gone then must I count my gains
What my gracious lord
Richard of York how fares our loving brother
Well my dread lord so must I call you now
How fares our cousin noble Lord of York
I thank you gentle uncle
O my lord You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far
He hath my lord
And therefore is he idle
O my fair cousin I must not say so
Then is he more beholding to you than I
He may command me as my sovereign But you have power in me as in a kinsman
I pray you uncle give me this dagger
My dagger little cousin
With all my heart
A beggar brother
Of my kind uncle that I know will give And being but a toy which is no grief to give
A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin
A greater gift
O that’s the sword to it
Ay gentle cousin were it light enough
O then I see you will part but with light gifts
In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay
It is too heavy for your Grace to wear
I weigh it lightly were it heavier
How
Uncle your Grace knows how to bear with him
You mean to bear me not to bear with me  Uncle my brother mocks both you and me
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower
Why what should you fear
Marry my uncle Clarence' angry ghost
My grandam told me he was murdered there
I fear no uncles dead
Nor none that live I hope
An if they live I hope I need not fear
No doubt no doubt
O ’tis a parlous boy Bold quick ingenious forward capable
He is all the mother’s from the top to toe
Well let them rest Come hither Catesby
He for his father’s sake so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him
What think’st thou then of Stanley
Will not he
He will do all in all as Hastings doth
Well then no more but this go gentle Catesby And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation
If thou dost find him tractable to us Encourage him and show him all our reasons
If he be leaden icy cold unwilling Be thou so too and so break off the talk And give us notice of his inclination For we tomorrow hold divided councils Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed
Commend me to Lord William
My good lords both with all the heed I can
Shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep
You shall my lord
At Crosby Place there shall you find us both
Now my lord what shall we do if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots
Chop off his head
Something we will determine
And look when I am king claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford and all the moveables Whereof the king my brother was possessed
I’ll claim that promise at your Grace’s hands
And look to have it yielded with all kindness
Come let us sup betimes that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form
One from the Lord Stanley
Upon the stroke of four
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights
So it appears by that I have to say
First he commends him to your noble self
What then
Then certifies your Lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razèd his helm Besides he says there are two councils kept And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th' other
His Honor and myself are at the one And at the other is my good friend Catesby Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence
Tell him his fears are shallow without instance
And for his dreams I wonder he’s so simple To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers
To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us And make pursuit where he did mean no chase
Many good morrows to my noble lord
Good morrow Catesby
You are early stirring
What news what news in this our tott'ring state
It is a reeling world indeed my lord And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm
How “wear the garland”
Dost thou mean the crown
Ay my good lord
I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
Ay on my life and hopes to find you forward Upon his party for the gain thereof And thereupon he sends you this good news That this same very day your enemies The kindred of the queen must die at Pomfret
Indeed I am no mourner for that news Because they have been still my adversaries
God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind
Well Catesby ere a fortnight make me older I’ll send some packing that yet think not on ’t
Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord When men are unprepared and look not for it
O monstrous monstrous
And so falls it out With Rivers Vaughan Grey and so ’twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I who as thou know’st are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham
The princes both make high account of you I know they do and I have well deserved it
Fear you the boar and go so unprovided
My lord good morrow
Good morrow Catesby  You may jest on but by the Holy Rood I do not like these several councils I
My lord I hold my life as dear as you do yours And never in my days I do protest Was it so precious to me as ’tis now
Think you but that I know our state secure I would be so triumphant as I am
Pray God I say I prove a needless coward
What shall we toward the Tower
The day is spent
Set down set down your honorable load If honor may be shrouded in a hearse Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster
Wot you what my lord
Today the lords you talked of are beheaded
They for their truth might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats
But come my lord let’s away
Go on before
I’ll talk with this good fellow
How now sirrah
How goes the world with thee
The better that your Lordship please to ask
I tell thee man ’tis better with me now Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet
But now I tell thee keep it to thyself  This day those enemies are put to death And I in better state than e'er I was
God hold it to your Honor’s good content
There drink that for me
I thank your Honor
Well met my lord
I am glad to see your Honor
I thank thee good Sir John with all my heart
I am in your debt for your last exercise
Come the next sabbath and I will content you
Your friends at Pomfret they do need the priest Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand
Good faith and when I met this holy man The men you talk of came into my mind
What go you toward the Tower
I shall return before your Lordship thence
Nay like enough for I stay dinner there
I’ll wait upon your Lordship
Dispatch
The limit of your lives is out
O Pomfret Pomfret
O thou bloody prison Fatal and ominous to noble peers
Now Margaret’s curse is fall'n upon our heads When she exclaimed on Hastings you and I For standing by when Richard stabbed her son
Then cursed she Hastings
O remember God To hear her prayer for them as now for us
And for my sister and her princely sons Be satisfied dear God with our true blood Which as thou know’st unjustly must be spilt
Make haste
The hour of death is expiate
Come Grey
Come Vaughan
Let us all embrace
In God’s name speak
When is the royal day
Is all things ready for the royal time
It is and wants but nomination
Tomorrow then I judge a happy day
Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein
Who is most inward with the noble duke
Your Grace we think should soonest know his mind
We know each other’s faces for our hearts He knows no more of mine than I of yours Or I of his my lord than you of mine  Lord Hastings you and he are near in love
I thank his Grace
I know he loves me well
But for his purpose in the coronation I have not sounded him nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein
But you my honorable lords may name the time And in the duke’s behalf I’ll give my voice Which I presume he’ll take in gentle part
In happy time here comes the duke himself
My noble lords and cousins all good morrow
Had you not come upon your cue my lord William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part  I mean your voice for crowning of the king
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder
Cousin of Buckingham a word with you
I’ll go with you
We have not yet set down this day of triumph
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester
I have sent for these strawberries
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning
There’s some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit
I think there’s never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he For by his face straight shall you know his heart
I pray God he be not I say
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil
If they have done this deed my noble lord  If
Thou protector of this damnèd strumpet Talk’st thou to me of “ifs”
Thou art a traitor  Off with his head
Woe woe for England
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm And I did scorn it and disdain to fly
Three times today my foot cloth horse did stumble And started when he looked upon the Tower As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse
O now I need the priest that spake to me
I now repent I told the pursuivant As too triumphing how mine enemies Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered And I myself secure in grace and favor
O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head
Make a short shrift
He longs to see your head
O momentary grace of mortal men Which we more hunt for than the grace of God
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep
Come come dispatch
Tis bootless to exclaim
O bloody Richard
Miserable England I prophesy the fearfull’st time to thee That ever wretched age hath looked upon  Come lead me to the block
Bear him my head
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead
Ghastly looks Are at my service like enforcèd smiles And both are ready in their offices At any time to grace my stratagems
But what is Catesby gone
Catesby o'erlook the walls
If ever he have wife let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my poor lord and thee  Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load Taken from Paul’s to be interrèd there
What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds
Lord Mayor the reason we have sent  Look back
Defend thee
Here are enemies
God and our innocence defend and guard us
Be patient
They are friends Ratcliffe and Lovell
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings
So dear I loved the man that I must weep
So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue That his apparent open guilt omitted  I mean his conversation with Shore’s wife  He lived from all attainder of suspects
Had he done so
What think you we are Turks or infidels
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore
But my good lord your Graces' words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak And do not doubt right noble princes both But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T' avoid the censures of the carping world
Moreover urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust Which stretched to their servants daughters wives Even where his raging eye or savage heart Without control lusted to make his prey
Nay for a need thus far come near my person Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward noble York My princely father then had wars in France And by true computation of the time Found that the issue was not his begot Which well appearèd in his lineaments Being nothing like the noble duke my father
Yet touch this sparingly as ’twere far off Because my lord you know my mother lives
And so my lord adieu
If you thrive well bring them to Baynard’s Castle Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well learnèd bishops
I go and towards three or four o'clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords
Go Lovell with all speed to Doctor Shaw
Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight And to give order that no manner of person Have any time recourse unto the princes
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings Which in a set hand fairly is engrossed That it may be today read o'er in Paul’s
Here’s a good world the while
Who is so gross That cannot see this palpable device
Bad is the world and all will come to naught When such ill dealing must be seen in thought
Now by the holy mother of our Lord The citizens are mum say not a word
Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children
No
His answer was the people were not used To be spoke to but by the recorder
Would not they speak
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come
The mayor is here at hand
And look you get a prayer book in your hand And stand between two churchmen good my lord For on that ground I’ll make a holy descant
And be not easily won to our requests
I go
An if you plead as well for them As I can say “nay” to thee for myself No doubt we bring it to a happy issue
Go go up to the leads
The Lord Mayor knocks
Welcome my lord
I think the duke will not be spoke withal
Now Catesby what says your lord to my request
He doth entreat your Grace my noble lord To visit him tomorrow or next day
Return good Catesby to the gracious duke
Tell him myself the mayor and aldermen No less importing than our general good In deep designs and matters of great moment Are come to have some conference with his grace
I’ll signify so much unto him straight
Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed But on his knees at meditation Not dallying with a brace of courtesans But meditating with two deep divines Not sleeping to engross his idle body But praying to enrich his watchful soul
Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his grave the sovereignty thereof
But sure I fear we shall not win him to it
Marry God defend his grace should say us nay
I fear he will
Here Catesby comes again
Now Catesby what says his grace
He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him His grace not being warned thereof before
He fears my lord you mean no good to him
Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him
When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads ’tis much to draw them thence So sweet is zealous contemplation
See where his Grace stands ’tween two clergymen
My lord there needs no such apology
I do beseech your Grace pardon me Who earnest in the service of my God Deferred the visitation of my friends
I do suspect I have done some offense That seems disgracious in the city’s eye And that you come to reprehend my ignorance
You have my lord
Sweet saint for charity be not so curst
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds Behold this pattern of thy butcheries
O gentlemen see see dead Henry’s wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh  Blush blush thou lump of foul deformity For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
O earth which this blood drink’st revenge his death
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick As thou dost swallow up this good king’s blood Which his hell governed arm hath butcherèd
If not to answer you might haply think Tongue tied ambition not replying yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty Which fondly you would here impose on me
First if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth Yet so much is my poverty of spirit So mighty and so many my defects That I would rather hide me from my greatness Being a bark to brook no mighty sea Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapor of my glory smothered
But God be thanked there is no need of me And much I need to help you were there need
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit Which mellowed by the stealing hours of time Will well become the seat of majesty And make no doubt us happy by his reign
On him I lay what you would lay on me The right and fortune of his happy stars Which God defend that I should wring from him
For first was he contract to Lady Lucy  Your mother lives a witness to that vow  And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona sister to the king of France
These both put off a poor petitioner A care crazed mother to a many sons A beauty waning and distressèd widow Even in the afternoon of her best days Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy
Refuse not mighty lord this proffered love
O make them joyful
Grant their lawful suit
Alas why would you heap this care on me
I am unfit for state and majesty
I do beseech you take it not amiss I cannot nor I will not yield to you
Zounds I’ll entreat no more
O do not swear my lord of Buckingham
If you deny them all the land will rue it
Will you enforce me to a world of cares
Call them again
I am not made of stones But penetrable to your kind entreaties Albeit against my conscience and my soul
God bless your Grace
We see it and will say it
In saying so you shall but say the truth
Then I salute you with this royal title Long live Richard England’s worthy king
Amen
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned
Even when you please since you will have it so
Who meets us here
My niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester
Now for my life she’s wandering to the Tower On pure heart’s love to greet the tender prince  Daughter well met
Whither away
No farther than the Tower and as I guess Upon the like devotion as yourselves To gratulate the gentle princes there
Kind sister thanks
We’ll enter all together
And in good time here the lieutenant comes  Master Lieutenant pray you by your leave How doth the prince and my young son of York
Right well dear madam
By your patience I may not suffer you to visit them
The king hath strictly charged the contrary
The king
Who’s that
I mean the Lord Protector
The Lord protect him from that kingly title
Hath he set bounds between their love and me
I am their mother
Who shall bar me from them
I am their father’s mother
I will see them
Their aunt I am in law in love their mother
Then bring me to their sights
I’ll bear thy blame And take thy office from thee on my peril
No madam no
I may not leave it so
I am bound by oath and therefore pardon me
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence And I’ll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker on of two fair queens
Ah cut my lace asunder That my pent heart may have some scope to beat Or else I swoon with this dead killing news
O unpleasing news
Thy mother’s name is ominous to children
You shall have letters from me to my son In your behalf to meet you on the way
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay
O ill dispersing wind of misery
And I in all unwillingness will go
O would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal that must round my brow Were red hot steel to sear me to the brains
To feed my humor wish thyself no harm
No
Why
Poor heart adieu
I pity thy complaining
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours
Farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory
Rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow For tender princes use my babies well
So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell
Lady you know no rules of charity Which renders good for bad blessings for curses
Villain thou know’st not law of God nor man
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
But I know none and therefore am no beast
More wonderful when angels are so angry
Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman Of these supposèd crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself
Vouchsafe defused infection of a man Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to curse thy cursèd self
Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself
Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself
By such despair I should accuse myself
My gracious sovereign
Give me thy hand
Thus high by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated
But shall we wear these glories for a day Or shall they last and we rejoice in them
Still live they and forever let them last
Ah Buckingham now do I play the touch To try if thou be current gold indeed
Young Edward lives think now what I would speak
Say on my loving lord
Ha
Tis so but Edward lives
True noble prince
O bitter consequence That Edward still should live “true noble prince”
Cousin thou wast not wont to be so dull
Shall I be plain
What sayest thou now
Your Grace may do your pleasure
Tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezes
Say have I thy consent that they shall die
Give me some little breath some pause dear lord Before I positively speak in this
I will resolve you herein presently
And unrespective boys
Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death
What is his name
His name my lord is Tyrrel
I partly know the man
Go call him hither boy No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels Hath he so long held out with me untired And stops he now for breath
Well be it so
How now Lord Stanley what’s the news
Know my long lord The marquess Dorset as I hear is fled To Richmond in the parts where he abides
Come hither Catesby
Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter
Look how thou dream’st
I say again give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die
Is thy name Tyrrel
James Tyrrel and your most obedient subject
Art thou indeed
Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine
Why then thou hast it
Two deep enemies Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep’s disturbers Are they that I would have thee deal upon
Tyrrel I mean those bastards in the Tower
Let me have open means to come to them And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them
Thou sing’st sweet music
Hark come hither Tyrrel
Go by this token
Rise and lend thine ear
There is no more but so
Say it is done And I will love thee and prefer thee for it
I will dispatch it straight
My lord I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in
Well let that rest
Dorset is fled to Richmond
I hear the news my lord
Stanley he is your wife’s son
Well look unto it
My lord I claim the gift my due by promise For which your honor and your faith is pawned  Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you promisèd I shall possess
Stanley look to your wife
If she convey Letters to Richmond you shall answer it
What says your Highness to my just request
I do remember me Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king When Richmond was a little peevish boy
A king perhaps  My lord  How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me I being by that I should kill him
My lord your promise for the earldom  Richmond
When last I was at Exeter The mayor in courtesy showed me the castle And called it Rougemont at which name I started Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond
My Lord  Ay what’s o'clock
I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promised me
Well but what’s o'clock
Upon the stroke of ten
Well let it strike
Why let it strike
Because that like a jack thou keep’st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation
I am not in the giving vein today
Why then resolve me whether you will or no
Thou troublest me I am not in the vein
And is it thus
Repays he my deep service With such deep contempt
Made I him king for this
O let me think on Hastings and be gone To Brecknock while my fearful head is on
The tyrannous and bloody act is done The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of
Dighton and Forrest whom I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery Albeit they were fleshed villains bloody dogs Melted with tenderness and mild compassion Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk And in their summer beauty kissed each other
Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news
If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness be happy then For it is done
But did’st thou see them dead
I did my lord
And buried gentle Tyrrel
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them But where to say the truth I do not know
Come to me Tyrrel soon at after supper When thou shalt tell the process of their death
Meantime but think how I may do thee good And be inheritor of thy desire
Farewell till then
I humbly take my leave
The son of Clarence have I pent up close His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight
Now for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth my brother’s daughter And by that knot looks proudly on the crown To her go I a jolly thriving wooer
My lord
Good or bad news that thou com’st in so bluntly
Bad news my lord
Morton is fled to Richmond And Buckingham backed with the hardy Welshmen Is in the field and still his power increaseth
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash levied strength
Say that I slew them not
Then say they were not slain
But dead they are and devilish slave by thee
I did not kill your husband
Why then he is alive
In thy foul throat thou liest
Queen Margaret saw Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood The which thou once didst bend against her breast But that thy brothers beat aside the point
I was provokèd by her sland'rous tongue That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
Thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind That never dream’st on aught but butcheries
Didst thou not kill this king
I grant you
Dost grant me hedgehog
Then God grant me too Thou mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed
O he was gentle mild and virtuous
The better for the King of heaven that hath him
He is in heaven where thou shalt never come
Let him thank me that holp to send him thither For he was fitter for that place than earth
Here in these confines slyly have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies
A dire induction am I witness to And will to France hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter black and tragical
Withdraw thee wretched Margaret
Who comes here
Ah my poor princes
Ah my tender babes My unblown flowers new appearing sweets If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fixed in doom perpetual Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother’s lamentation
Hover about her say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night
So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe wearied tongue is still and mute
Edward Plantagenet why art thou dead
Wilt thou O God fly from such gentle lambs And throw them in the entrails of the wolf
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
Give mine the benefit of seigniory And let my griefs frown on the upper hand
I had a Richard too and thou did’st kill him I had a Rutland too thou holp’st to kill him
O upright just and true disposing God How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother’s body And makes her pew fellow with others' moan
O Harry’s wife triumph not in my woes
God witness with me I have wept for thine
Thy Edward he is dead that killed my Edward Thy other Edward dead to quit my Edward Young York he is but boot because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward And the beholders of this frantic play Th' adulterate Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey Untimely smothered in their dusky graves
Richard yet lives hell’s black intelligencer Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither
Cancel his bond of life dear God I pray That I may live to say “The dog is dead”
O thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider that foul bunch backed toad
I called thee then “vain flourish of my fortune” I called thee then poor shadow “painted queen” The presentation of but what I was The flattering index of a direful pageant One heaved a high to be hurled down below A mother only mocked with two fair babes A dream of what thou wast a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot A sign of dignity a breath a bubble A queen in jest only to fill the scene
Where is thy husband now
Where be thy brothers
Where are thy two sons
Thus hath the course of justice whirled about And left thee but a very prey to time Having no more but thought of what thou wast To torture thee the more being what thou art
Thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
These English woes will make me smile in France
O thou well skilled in curses stay awhile And teach me how to curse mine enemies
Forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days Compare dead happiness with living woe Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were And he that slew them fouler than he is
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse
My words are dull
O quicken them with thine
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
Why should calamity be full of words
If so then be not tongue tied
Go with me And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother My damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered
Who intercepts my expedition
O she that might have intercepted thee By strangling thee in her accursèd womb From all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded if that right were right The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers
Tell me thou villain slave where are my children
Where is gentle Rivers Vaughan Grey
Where is kind Hastings
Strike alarum drums
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed
Strike I say
Either be patient and entreat me fair Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations
Art thou my son
Ay I thank God my father and yourself
Then patiently hear my impatience
Madam I have a touch of your condition Which cannot brook the accent of reproof
O let me speak
Do then but I’ll not hear
I will be mild and gentle in my words
And brief good mother for I am in haste
Art thou so hasty
I have stayed for thee God knows in torment and in agony
And came I not at last to comfort you
What comfortable hour canst thou name That ever graced me in thy company
Faith none but Humfrey Hower that called your Grace To breakfast once forth of my company
I prithee hear me speak
You speak too bitterly
Hear me a word For I shall never speak to thee again
So
Though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me
I say amen to her
Stay madam
I must talk a word with you
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter
You have a daughter called Elizabeth Virtuous and fair royal and gracious
And must she die for this
O let her live And I’ll corrupt her manners stain her beauty Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed Throw over her the veil of infamy
So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter
Wrong not her birth
She is a royal princess
To save her life I’ll say she is not so
And only in that safety died her brothers
No to their lives ill friends were contrary
My babes were destined to a fairer death If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life
Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts Thy head all indirectly gave direction
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone hard heart To revel in the entrails of my lambs
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes And I in such a desp'rate bay of death Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
Madam so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed
What good is covered with the face of heaven To be discovered that can do me good
The advancement of your children gentle lady
Up to some scaffold there to lose their heads
Unto the dignity and height of fortune The high imperial type of this earth’s glory
And thou unfit for any place but hell
Yes one place else if you will hear me name it
Some dungeon
Your bedchamber
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
So will it madam till I lie with you
Be brief lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness' date
Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter
My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul
What do you think
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning
Even he that makes her queen
Who else should be
What thou
How think you of it
How canst thou woo her
Madam with all my heart
You mock me madam
This is not the way To win your daughter
There is no other way Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard that hath done all this
Say that I did all this for love of her
Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee Having bought love with such a bloody spoil
Look what is done cannot be now amended
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes Which after hours give leisure to repent
If I did take the kingdom from your sons To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter
If I have killed the issue of your womb To quicken your increase I will beget Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
A grandam’s name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother
Your children were vexation to your youth But mine shall be a comfort to your age
I cannot make you what amends I would Therefore accept such kindness as I can
What we have many goodly days to see
Go then my mother to thy daughter go
What were I best to say
Her father’s brother Would be her lord
Or shall I say her uncle
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
Under what title shall I woo for thee That God the law my honor and her love Can make seem pleasing to her tender years
Infer fair England’s peace by this alliance
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war
Tell her the king that may command entreats  That at her hands which the king’s King forbids
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen
To vail the title as her mother doth
Say I will love her everlastingly
But how long shall that title “ever” last
Sweetly in force unto her fair life’s end
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it
As long as hell and Richard likes of it
Say I her sovereign am her subject low
But she your subject loathes such sovereignty
Be eloquent in my behalf to her
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told
Then plainly to her tell my loving tale
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick
O no my reasons are too deep and dead  Too deep and dead poor infants in their graves
Harp not on that string madam that is past
Harp on it still shall I till heart strings break
Now by my George my Garter and my crown  Profaned dishonored and the third usurped
I swear       By nothing for this is no oath
Then by myself       Thyself is self misused
Now by the world       'Tis full of thy foul wrongs
My father’s death       Thy life hath it dishonored
If thou hadst feared to break an oath by Him Th' imperial metal circling now thy head Had graced the tender temples of my child And both the princes had been breathing here Which now two tender bedfellows for dust Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms
What canst thou swear by now
The time to come
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered Ungoverned youth to wail it in their age The parents live whose children thou hast butchered Old barren plants to wail it with their age
Swear not by time to come for that thou hast Misused ere used by times ill used o'erpast
As I intend to prosper and repent So thrive I in my dangerous affairs Of hostile arms
Myself myself confound Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours Day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest Be opposite all planets of good luck To my proceedings if with dear heart’s love Immaculate devotion holy thoughts I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
In her consists my happiness and thine
Urge the necessity and state of times And be not peevish found in great designs
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus
Ay if the devil tempt you to do good
Ay if your self’s remembrance wrong yourself
Yet thou didst kill my children
But in your daughter’s womb I bury them Where in that nest of spicery they will breed Selves of themselves to your recomforture
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will
And be a happy mother by the deed
I go
Write to me very shortly And you shall understand from me her mind
To our shores Throng many doubtful hollow hearted friends Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back
Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral And there they hull expecting but the aid Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore
Some light foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk  Ratcliffe thyself or Catesby
Catesby fly to the duke
I will my lord with all convenient haste
Ratcliffe come hither
Post to Salisbury
O true good Catesby
Bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power that he can make And meet me suddenly at Salisbury
I go
What may it please you shall I do at Salisbury
Why what wouldst thou do there before I go
Your Highness told me I should post before
My mind is changed
Stanley what news with you
None good my liege to please you with the hearing Nor none so bad but well may be reported
Hoyday a riddle
Neither good nor bad
What need’st thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way
Once more what news
Richmond is on the seas
There let him sink and be the seas on him
White livered runagate what doth he there
Well as you guess
Stirred up by Dorset Buckingham and Morton He makes for England here to claim the crown
It is my day my life
Black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life
Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
I would I were to be revenged on thee
His better doth not breathe upon the earth
Is the chair empty
Is the sword unswayed
Is the king dead the empire unpossessed
What heir of York is there alive but we
And who is England’s king but great York’s heir
Then tell me what makes he upon the seas
Where is thy power then to beat him back
Where be thy tenants and thy followers
Are they not now upon the western shore Safe conducting the rebels from their ships
Cold friends to me
What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west
They have not been commanded mighty king
Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave I’ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace Where and what time your Majesty shall please
Most mighty sovereign You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful
I never was nor never will be false
Go then and muster men but leave behind Your son George Stanley
My gracious sovereign now in Devonshire As I by friends am well advertisèd Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate Bishop of Exeter his elder brother With many more confederates are in arms
In Kent my liege the Guilfords are in arms And every hour more competitors Flock to the rebels and their power grows strong
My lord the army of great Buckingham  Out on you owls
Nothing but songs of death
But this good comfort bring I to your Highness The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest
March on march on since we are up in arms If not to fight with foreign enemies Yet to beat down these rebels here at home
While we reason here A royal battle might be won and lost
Someone take order Buckingham be brought To Salisbury
The rest march on with me
But tell me where is princely Richmond now
At Pembroke or at Ha'rfordwest in Wales
Sir Walter Herbert a renownèd soldier Sir Gilbert Talbot Sir William Stanley Oxford redoubted Pembroke Sir James Blunt And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew And many other of great name and worth And towards London they do bend their power If by the way they be not fought withal
Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York And all the clouds that loured upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
Grim visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front And now instead of mounting barbèd steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute
Will not King Richard let me speak with him
No my good lord
Therefore be patient
Hastings and Edward’s children Grey and Rivers Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward Vaughan and all that have miscarrièd By underhand corrupted foul injustice If that your moody discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour Even for revenge mock my destruction  This is All Souls' Day fellow is it not
It is
Why then All Souls' Day is my body’s doomsday
This is the day which in King Edward’s time I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife’s allies
This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted
This this All Souls' Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs
That high All seer which I dallied with Hath turned my feignèd prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men To turn their own points in their masters' bosoms
Wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear
Which in his dearest need will fly from him
All for our vantage
Then in God’s name march
True hope is swift and flies with swallow’s wings
Kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks
My Lord of Norfolk  Here most gracious liege
Norfolk we must have knocks ha must we not
We must both give and take my loving lord
Up with my tent Here will I lie tonight
But where tomorrow
Well all’s one for that
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power
Why our battalia trebles that account
Besides the king’s name is a tower of strength Which they upon the adverse party want
Let’s lack no discipline make no delay For lords tomorrow is a busy day
My Lord of Oxford you Sir William Brandon And you Sir Walter Herbert stay with me
The earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment  Good Captain Blunt bear my goodnight to him And by the second hour in the morning Desire the earl to see me in my tent
Unless I have mista'en his colors much Which well I am assured I have not done His regiment lies half a mile at least South from the mighty power of the king
If without peril it be possible Sweet Blunt make some good means to speak with him And give him from me this most needful note
Upon my life my lord I’ll undertake it
He lives that loves thee better than he could
Name him
Plantagenet
Why that was he
The selfsame name but one of better nature
Where is he
Here
Why dost thou spit at me
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake
Never came poison from so sweet a place
Never hung poison on a fouler toad
Out of my sight
Thou dost infect mine eyes
Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
Good night good Captain Blunt
Come gentlemen Let us consult upon tomorrow’s business Into my tent
The dew is raw and cold
What is “t o”clock
It’s suppertime my lord
It’s nine o'clock
I will not sup tonight
Give me some ink and paper
What is my beaver easier than it was
And all my armor laid into my tent
Good Norfolk hie thee to thy charge
I go my lord
Stir with the lark tomorrow gentle Norfolk
I warrant you my lord
Catesby
My lord
My lord
Sawst thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland
Thomas the earl of Surrey and himself Much about cockshut time from troop to troop Went through the army cheering up the soldiers
So I am satisfied
Set it down
Is ink and paper ready
It is my lord
Ratcliffe about the mid of night come to my tent And help to arm me
Leave me I say
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm
All comfort that the dark night can afford Be to thy person noble father in law
Tell me how fares our loving mother
I by attorney bless thee from thy mother Who prays continually for Richmond’s good
In brief for so the season bids us be Prepare thy battle early in the morning And put thy fortune to the arbitrament Of bloody strokes and mortal staring war
I as I may that which I would I cannot  With best advantage will deceive the time And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms
But on thy side I may not be too forward Lest being seen thy brother tender George Be executed in his father’s sight
Farewell
The leisure and the fearful time Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love And ample interchange of sweet discourse Which so long sundered friends should dwell upon
God give us leisure for these rites of love
Once more adieu
Be valiant and speed well
Once more good night kind lords and gentlemen
O Thou whose captain I account myself Look on my forces with a gracious eye
Make us thy ministers of chastisement That we may praise thee in the victory
To thee I do commend my watchful soul Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes
Sleeping and waking O defend me still
Think upon Vaughan and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance
Despair and die
Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish
Think on Lord Hastings
Despair and die
Thy adversary’s wife doth pray for thee
The last was I that felt thy tyranny
O in the battle think on Buckingham And die in terror of thy guiltiness
Dream on dream on of bloody deeds and death
But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismayed
Give me another horse
Bind up my wounds
Have mercy Jesu Soft I did but dream
O coward conscience how dost thou afflict me
What do I fear
Myself
There’s none else by
Richard loves Richard that is I and I
Is there a murderer here
No
Yes I am
Then fly
What from myself
Alack I love myself
Wherefore
For any good That I myself have done unto myself
O no
Alas I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself
I am a villain
Fool of thyself speak well
Fool do not flatter
My lord
Zounds who is there
Ratcliffe my lord ’tis I
The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor
O Ratcliffe I have dreamed a fearful dream
What think’st thou will our friends prove all true
No doubt my lord
By the apostle Paul shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond
Tis not yet near day
Come go with me Under our tents I’ll play the eavesdropper To see if any mean to shrink from me
Good morrow Richmond
Cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here
How have you slept my lord
The sweetest sleep and fairest boding dreams That ever entered in a drowsy head Have I since your departure had my lords
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murdered Came to my tent and cried on victory
I promise you my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream
How far into the morning is it lords
Upon the stroke of four
Why then ’tis time to arm and give direction
God and our good cause fight upon our side
The prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls Like high reared bulwarks stand before our faces
Richard except those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow
For what is he they follow
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down You sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
If you do fight against your country’s foes Your country’s fat shall pay your pains the hire
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
If you do free your children from the sword Your children’s children quits it in your age
Then in the name of God and all these rights Advance your standards
I would they were that I might die at once For now they kill me with a living death
I never sued to friend nor enemy My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive Lo here I lend thee this sharp pointed sword Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee
Nay do not pause for I did kill King Henry  But ’twas thy beauty that provokèd me
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond
That he was never trainèd up in arms
He said the truth
And what said Surrey then
He smiled and said “The better for our purpose” He was in the right and so indeed it is
Tell the clock there
Give me a calendar
Not I my lord
Ratcliffe
My lord
The sun will not be seen today
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army
I would these dewy tears were from the ground
Not shine today
Arm arm my lord
The foe vaunts in the field
Come bustle bustle
John Duke of Norfolk Thomas Earl of Surrey Shall have the leading of this foot and horse
They thus directed we will follow In the main battle whose puissance on either side Shall be well wingèd with our chiefest horse
This and Saint George to boot What think’st thou Norfolk
A good direction warlike sovereign
This found I on my tent this morning
Hark
I hear their drum
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves 
What says Lord Stanley
Will he bring his power
My lord he doth deny to come
Off with his son George’s head
My lord the enemy is past the marsh
After the battle let George Stanley die
Upon them
Victory sits on our helms
Rescue my lord of Norfolk rescue rescue
The king enacts more wonders than a man Daring an opposite to every danger
His horse is slain and all on foot he fights Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death
Rescue fair lord or else the day is lost
A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
Withdraw my lord
I’ll help you to a horse
God and your arms be praised victorious friends
Great God of heaven say amen to all
But tell me is young George Stanley living
He is my lord and safe in Leicester town Whither if it please you we may now withdraw us
John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon
And then as we have ta'en the sacrament We will unite the white rose and the red
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction That long have frowned upon their enmity
What traitor hears me and says not “Amen” England hath long been mad and scarred herself
O now let Richmond and Elizabeth The true succeeders of each royal house By God’s fair ordinance conjoin together And let their heirs God if thy will be so
Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord That would reduce these bloody days again And make poor England weep in streams of blood
Let them not live to taste this land’s increase That would with treason wound this fair land’s peace
Now civil wounds are stopped peace lives again
That she may long live here God say amen
Take up the sword again or take up me
Arise dissembler
Though I wish thy death I will not be the executioner
I have already
That was in thy rage
Speak it again and even with the word This hand which for thy love did kill thy love Shall for thy love kill a far truer love
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory
I would I knew thy heart
Tis figured in my tongue
I fear me both are false
Then never man was man true
Well well put up your sword
Say then my peace is made
That shall you know hereafter
But shall I live in hope
All men I hope live so
Vouchsafe to wear this ring
Wear both of them for both of them are thine
And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favor at thy gracious hand Thou dost confirm his happiness forever
What is it
That it would please you leave these sad designs To him that hath more cause to be a mourner And presently repair to Crosby House Where after I have solemnly interred At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king And wet his grave with my repentant tears I will with all expedient duty see you
For divers unknown reasons I beseech you Grant me this boon
With all my heart and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent  Tressel and Berkeley go along with me
Bid me farewell
Sirs take up the corse
Towards Chertsey noble lord
No to Whitefriars
There attend my coming
Was ever woman in this humor wooed
Was ever woman in this humor won
I’ll have her but I will not keep her long
And yet to win her all the world to nothing
Ha
Hath she forgot already that brave prince Edward her lord whom I some three months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury
A sweeter and a Lovellier gentleman Framed in the prodigality of nature Young valiant wise and no doubt right royal The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet abase her eyes on me That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed
On me whose all not equals Edward’s moiety
On me that halts and am misshapen thus
My dukedom to a beggarly denier I do mistake my person all this while
Upon my life she finds although I cannot Myself to be a marv'lous proper man
I’ll be at charges for a looking glass And entertain a score or two of tailors To study fashions to adorn my body
Since I am crept in favor with myself I will maintain it with some little cost
But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love
Shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass That I may see my shadow as I pass
Have patience madam
There’s no doubt his majesty Will soon recover his accustomed health
If he were dead what would betide on me
Ah he is young and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester A man that loves not me nor none of you
Is it concluded that he shall be Protector
It is determined not concluded yet But so it must be if the king miscarry
God make your Majesty joyful as you have been
Saw you the king today my lord of Derby
But now the duke of Buckingham and I Are come from visiting his majesty
What likelihood of his amendment lords
Madam good hope
His grace speaks cheerfully
God grant him health
Did you confer with him
Ay madam
Would all were well but that will never be
They do me wrong and I will not endure it
Who is it that complains unto the king That I forsooth am stern and love them not
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm But thus his simple truth must be abused With silken sly insinuating jacks
To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace
To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
When have I injured thee
Or any of your faction
A plague upon you all
His royal grace Whom God preserve better than you would wish Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while But you must trouble him with lewd complaints
Brother of Gloucester you mistake the matter
I cannot tell
The world is grown so bad That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
Come come we know your meaning brother Gloucester
You envy my advancement and my friends'
God grant we never may have need of you
Meantime God grants that we have need of you
Our brother is imprisoned by your means Myself disgraced and the nobility Held in contempt while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble
By Him that raised me to this careful height From that contented hap which I enjoyed I never did incense his majesty Against the duke of Clarence but have been An earnest advocate to plead for him
And therefore since I cannot prove a lover To entertain these fair well spoken days I am determinèd to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days
Plots have I laid inductions dangerous By drunken prophecies libels and dreams To set my brother Clarence and the king In deadly hate the one against the other And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle false and treacherous This day should Clarence closely be mewed up About a prophecy which says that “G” Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be
His majesty Tend'ring my person’s safety hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower
Upon what cause
Because my name is George
Alack my lord that fault is none of yours
He should for that commit your godfathers
O belike his majesty hath some intent That you shall be new christened in the Tower
But what’s the matter Clarence
May I know
What may she not
I wis your grandam had a worser match
My Lord of Gloucester I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
By heaven I will acquaint his majesty With those gross taunts that oft I have endured
I had rather be a country servant maid Than a great queen with this condition To be so baited scorned and stormèd at
Small joy have I in being England’s queen
So should we you if you should be our king
If I should be
I had rather be a peddler
Hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out In sharing that which you have pilled from me
Which of you trembles not that looks on me
Foul wrinkled witch what mak’st thou in my sight
But repetition of what thou hast marred
That will I make before I let thee go
Wert thou not banishèd on pain of death
I was but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode
The sorrow that I have by right is yours And all the pleasures you usurp are mine
O ’twas the foulest deed to slay that babe And the most merciless that e'er was heard of
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
What were you snarling all before I came Ready to catch each other by the throat And turn you all your hatred now on me
Thyself a queen for me that was a queen Outlive thy glory like my wretched self
Have done thy charm thou hateful withered hag
And leave out thee
Stay dog for thou shalt hear me
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
Richard
Ha
I call thee not
I cry thee mercy then for I did think That thou hadst called me all these bitter names
Why so I did but looked for no reply
O let me make the period to my curse
Tis done by me and ends in “Margaret” Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself
Poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse that poisonous bunch backed toad
False boding woman end thy frantic curse Lest to thy harm thou move our patience
Foul shame upon you you have all moved mine
Were you well served you would be taught your duty
To serve me well you all should do me duty Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
O serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
Good counsel marry
Learn it learn it marquess
It touches you my lord as much as me
And turns the sun to shade
Urge neither charity nor shame to me
Uncharitably with me have you dealt And shamefully my hopes by you are butchered
My charity is outrage life my shame And in that shame still live my sorrows' rage
Have done have done
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood Nor thou within the compass of my curse
Nor no one here for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air
What doth she say my lord of Buckingham
Nothing that I respect my gracious lord
What dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel And soothe the devil that I warn thee from
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses
And so doth mine
I muse why she’s at liberty
I cannot blame her
I never did her any to my knowledge
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong
Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid He is franked up to fatting for his pains
God pardon them that are the cause thereof
So do I everFor had I cursed now I had cursed myself
Yea Richard when I know for I protest As yet I do not
But as I can learn He hearkens after prophecies and dreams And from the crossrow plucks the letterAnd says a wizard told him that by “G” His issue disinherited should be
And for my name of George begins withIt follows in his thought that I am he
Why this it is when men are ruled by women
Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower
My Lady Grey his wife Clarence ’tis she That tempers him to this extremity
Madam his majesty doth call for you  And for your Grace  and yours my gracious lords
We wait upon your Grace
I do the wrong and first begin to brawl
Now they believe it and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers Dorset Grey But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture Tell them that God bids us do good for evil And thus I clothe my naked villainy With odd old ends stolen out of Holy Writ And seem a saint when most I play the devil
But soft
Are you now going to dispatch this thing
We are my lord and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is
Well thought upon
I have it here about me
Tut tut my lord we will not stand to prate
Talkers are no good doers
Be assured We go to use our hands and not our tongues
Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes drop tears
I like you lads
Go go dispatch
We will my noble lord
Why looks your grace so heavily today
What was your dream my lord
I pray you tell me
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy And in my company my brother Gloucester Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches
Thence we looked toward England And cited up a thousand fearful times During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us
O Lord methought what pain it was to drown What dreadful noise of waters in my ears What sights of ugly death within my eyes
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl Inestimable stones unvalued jewels All scattered in the bottom of the sea
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep
Methought I had and often did I strive To yield the ghost but still the envious flood Stopped in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty vast and wand'ring air But smothered it within my panting bulk Who almost burst to belch it in the sea
I passed methought the melancholy flood With that sour ferryman which poets write of Unto the kingdom of perpetual night
The first that there did greet my stranger soul Was my great father in law renownèd Warwick Who spake aloud “What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence” And so he vanished
No marvel lord though it affrighted you
I am afraid methinks to hear you tell it
Ah keeper keeper I have done those things That now give evidence against my soul For Edward’s sake and see how he requites me  O God if my deep prayers cannot appease thee But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds Yet execute thy wrath in me alone
O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children  Keeper I prithee sit by me awhile
My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep
I will my lord
God give your Grace good rest
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours Makes the night morning and the noontide night
Princes have but their titles for their glories An outward honor for an inward toil
What wouldst thou fellow
And how cam’st thou hither
I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs
What so brief
Tis better sir to be brief than tedious Let him see our commission and talk no more
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands
There lies the duke asleep and there the keys
You may sir
Tis a point of wisdom
Fare you well
What shall I stab him as he sleeps
No
He’ll say ’twas done cowardly when he wakes
Why he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day
Why then he’ll say we stabbed him sleeping
The urging of that word “judgment” hath bred a kind of remorse in me
What art thou afraid
Not to kill him having a warrant but to be damned for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me
I thought thou hadst been resolute
So I am to let him live
I’ll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so
Nay I prithee stay a little
I hope this passionate humor of mine will change
It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty
How dost thou feel thyself now
Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me
Remember our reward when the deed’s done
Zounds he dies
I had forgot the reward
Where’s thy conscience now
O in the duke of Gloucester’s purse
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out
Tis no matter
Let it go
There’s few or none will entertain it
What if it come to thee again
I’ll not meddle with it
Tis a blushing shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom
I am strong framed
He cannot prevail with me
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation
Come shall we fall to work
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then throw him into the malmsey butt in the next room
O excellent device  and make a sop of him
Strike
No we’ll reason with him
Where art thou keeper
Give me a cup of wine
You shall have wine enough my lord anon
In God’s name what art thou
A man as you are
But not as I am royal
Nor you as we are loyal
Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
My voice is now the king’s my looks mine own
Your eyes do menace me
Why look you pale
Who sent you hither
Wherefore do you come
To to to  To murder me
Ay ay
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
Wherein my friends have I offended you
Offended us you have not but the king
I shall be reconciled to him again
Never my lord
Therefore prepare to die
Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent
What is my offense
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me
What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge
Or who pronounced The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death Before I be convict by course of law
To threaten me with death is most unlawful
I charge you as you hope to have redemption By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins That you depart and lay no hands on me
What we will do we do upon command
Even so
An please your Worship Brakenbury You may partake of anything we say
We speak no treason man
We say the king Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen Well struck in years fair and not jealous
We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue And that the queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks
How say you sir
Can you deny all this
With this my lord myself have naught to do
Her husband knave
Wouldst thou betray me
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me and withal Forbear your conference with the noble duke
And he that hath commanded is our king
And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend
How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree
For whose sake did I that ill deed
For Edward for my brother for his sake
If God will be avengèd for this deed O know you yet He doth it publicly
Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm He needs no indirect or lawless course To cut off those that have offended Him
My brother’s love the devil and my rage
I am his brother and I love him well
You are deceived
Your brother Gloucester hates you
O no he loves me and he holds me dear
Go you to him from me
Ay so we will
Tell him when that our princely father York Blessed his three sons with his victorious arm He little thought of this divided friendship
Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep
Ay millstones as he lessoned us to weep
Right as snow in harvest
Come you deceive yourself
Tis he that sends us to destroy you here
Why so he doth when he delivers you From this earth’s thralldom to the joys of heaven
Make peace with God for you must die my lord
Have you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God And art you yet to your own souls so blind That thou will war with God by murd'ring me
O sirs consider they that set you on To do this deed will hate you for the deed
Relent and save your souls
Which of you if you were a prince’s son Being pent from liberty as I am now  If two such murderers as yourselves came to you Would not entreat for life
Ay you would beg Were you in my distress
Relent
No
Tis cowardly and womanish
Look behind you my lord
Take that and that
How now
What mean’st thou that thou help’st me not
By heavens the duke shall know how slack you have been
I would he knew that I had saved his brother
So do not I
Go coward as thou art
Well I’ll go hide the body in some hole Till that the duke give order for his burial
And when I have my meed I will away For this will out and then I must not stay
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
As mine on hers so hers is set on mine And all combined save what thou must combine By holy marriage
When and where and how We met we wooed and made exchange of vow I’ll tell thee as we pass but this I pray That thou consent to marry us today
Holy Saint Francis what a change is here
Is Rosaline whom thou didst love so dear So soon forsaken
Young men’s love then lies Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
And art thou changed
Pronounce this sentence then Women may fall when there’s no strength in men
Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline
For doting not for loving pupil mine
And badest me bury love
Not in a grave To lay one in another out to have
I pray thee chide not
The other did not so
Oh she knew well Thy love did read by rote that could not spell
But come young waverer come go with me In one respect I’ll thy assistant be For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households' rancor to pure love
Oh let us hence
I stand on sudden haste
Wisely and slow
They stumble that run fast
Where the devil should this Romeo be
Came he not home tonight
Not to his father’s
I spoke with his man
Why that same pale hard hearted wench that Rosaline Torments him so that he will sure run mad
Tybalt the kinsman to old Capulet Hath sent a letter to his father’s house
A challenge on my life
Romeo will answer it
Any man that can write may answer a letter
Nay he will answer the letter’s master how he dares being dared
Alas poor Romeo
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt
Why what is Tybalt
The what
Without his roe like a dried herring
O flesh flesh how art thou fishified
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in
Good morrow to you both
What counterfeit did I give you
The slip sir the slip
Can you not conceive
Nay I am the very pink of courtesy
I serve as good a man as you
No better
Well sir
You lie
You know not what you do
What art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
Come between us good Benvolio
My wits faints
Switch and spurs switch and spurs or I’ll cry a match
Nay if our wits run the wild goose chase I am done for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole five
Was I with you there for the goose
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest
Nay good goose bite not
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting
It is a most sharp sauce
And is it not well served into a sweet goose
Oh here’s a wit of cheveril that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad
I stretch it out for that word “broad” which added to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
Why is not this better now than groaning for love
Now art thou sociable
Now art thou Romeo
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
Oh thou art deceived
I would have made it short for I was come to the whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer
Here’s goodly gear
Two two a shirt and a smock
Peter
Anon
My fan Peter
God ye good morrow gentlemen
God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman
Is it good e'en
Tis no less I tell you for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon
Out upon you
What a man are you
One gentlewoman that God hath made himself to mar
By my troth it is well said
For himself to mar” quoth he
Gentlemen can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo
I can tell you but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him
I am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse
You say well
Yea is the worst well
Very well took i' faith wisely wisely
She will indite him to some supper
So ho
What hast thou found
Romeo will you come to your father’s
We’ll to dinner thither
I will follow you
A gentleman Nurse that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month
An he speak any thing against me I’ll take him down an he were lustier than he is and twenty such Jacks
And if I cannot I’ll find those that shall
Scurvy knave
I am none of his flirt gills
I am none of his skains mates
I saw no man use you at his pleasure
If I had my weapon should quickly have been out I warrant you
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side
Now afore God I am so vexed that every part about me quivers
Scurvy knave
Nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress
I protest unto thee  Good heart and i' faith I will tell her as much
Lord Lord she will be a joyful woman
What wilt thou tell her Nurse
Thou dost not mark me
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell Be shrived and married
And stay good Nurse
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair Which to the high top gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night
Farewell
Be trusty and I’ll quit thy pains
Farewell
Commend me to thy mistress
Now God in heaven bless thee
Hark you sir
What sayst thou my dear Nurse
Is your man secret
Did you ne'er hear say “Two may keep counsel putting one away”
Warrant thee my man’s as true as steel
Well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady Lord Lord
when ’twas a little prating thing Oh there is a nobleman in town one Paris that would fain lay knife aboard but she good soul had as lief see a toad a very toad as see him
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man
But I’ll warrant you when I say so she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world
Doth notAy Nurse what of that
Both with anAh mocker that’s the dog’s name
Commend me to thy lady
Ay a thousand times Peter
Anon
Before and apace
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse
Perchance she cannot meet him
That’s not so
Oh she is lame
Love’s heralds should be thoughts Which ten times faster glide than the sun’s beams Driving back shadows over louring hills
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day’s journey and from nine till twelve Is three long hours yet she is not come
Had she affections and warm youthful blood She would be as swift in motion as a ball
My words would bandy her to my sweet love And his to me
But old folks many feign as they were dead Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
O God she comes O honey Nurse what news
Hast thou met with him
Send thy man away
Peter stay at the gate
Now good sweet Nurse  O Lord why look’st thou sad
Though news be sad yet tell them merrily
If good thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face
I am aweary
Give me leave awhile
Fie how my bones ache
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news
Can you not stay awhile
Do you not see that I am out of breath
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
Is thy news good or bad
Answer to that
Say either and I’ll stay the circumstance
Let me be satisfied
Is ’t good or bad
Well you have made a simple choice
You know not how to choose a man
Romeo
No not he though his face be better than any man’s yet his leg excels all men’s and for a hand and a foot and a body though they be not to be talked on yet they are past compare
He is not the flower of courtesy but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb
Go thy ways wench
Serve God
What have you dined at home
No no
But all this did I know before
What says he of our marriage
What of that
My back a' t' other side
Ah my back my back
I' faith I am sorry that thou art not well
Sweet sweet sweet Nurse tell me what says my love
Your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and I warrant a virtuous  Where is your mother
Where is my mother
Why she is within
Where should she be
How oddly thou repliest
Your love says like an honest gentleman 'Where is your mother
O God’s lady dear Are you so hot
Marry come up I trow
Is this the poultice for my aching bones
Henceforward do your messages yourself
Here’s such a coil
Come what says Romeo
Have you got leave to go to shrift today
I have
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’s cell
There stays a husband to make you a wife
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news
Hie you to church
I must another way To fetch a ladder by the which your love Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark
Go
I’ll to dinner
Hie you to the cell
I do but keep the peace
Put up thy sword Or manage it to part these men with me
What drawn and talk of peace
I hate the word As I hate hell all Montagues and thee
Have at thee coward
Clubs bills and partisans
Strike
Beat them down
Down with the Capulets
Down with the Montagues
What noise is this
My sword I say
Old Montague is come And flourishes his blade in spite of me
Thou villain Capulet
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe
Hie to high fortune
Honest Nurse farewell
Amen amen
But come what sorrow can It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight
Therefore love moderately
Long love doth so
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
Here comes the lady
Oh so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint
Good even to my ghostly confessor
Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
As much to him else is his thanks too much
Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine and that thy skill be more To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air and let rich music’s tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter
Conceit more rich in matter than in words Brags of his substance not of ornament
Come come with me and we will make short work
I pray thee good Mercutio let’s retire
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says “God send me no need of thee” and by the operation of the second cup draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need
Am I like such a fellow
Come come thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be moved
And what to
Nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would kill the other
Thou why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter
With another for tying his new shoes with old ribbon
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter
The fee simple
O simple
By my head here comes the Capulets
By my heel I care not
Couple it with something
Make it a word and a blow
You shall find me apt enough to that sir an you will give me occasion
Could you not take some occasion without giving
Mercutio thou consort’st with Romeo
What dost thou make us minstrels
An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords
We talk here in the public haunt of men
Either withdraw unto some private place And reason coldly of your grievances Or else depart
Here all eyes gaze on us
Men’s eyes were made to look and let them gaze
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure I
Well peace be with you sir
Here comes my man
But I’ll be hanged sir if he wear your livery
Tybalt the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting
Villain am I none
Therefore farewell
I see thou know’st me not
Boy this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me
Therefore turn and draw
And so good Capulet which name I tender As dearly as my own be satisfied
O calm dishonourable vile submission
What wouldst thou have with me
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears
Make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be out
I am for you
Gentle Mercutio put thy rapier up
Away Tybalt
I am hurt
A plague o' both your houses
I am sped
Is he gone and hath nothing
What art thou hurt
Marry ’tis enough
Where is my page Go villain fetch a surgeon
Courage man
The hurt cannot be much
No ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but ’tis enough ’twill serve
Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man
I am peppered I warrant for this world
A plague o' both your houses
Zounds a dog a rat a mouse a cat to scratch a man to death
A braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic
Why the devil came you between us
I was hurt under your arm
I thought all for the best
Help me into some house Benvolio Or I shall faint
A plague o' both your houses
They have made worms' meat of me
I have it And soundly too
Your houses
O Romeo Romeo brave Mercutio is dead
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again
Alive in triumph and Mercutio slain
Either thou or I or both must go with him
Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence
This shall determine that
Romeo away be gone
The citizens are up and Tybalt slain
Stand not amazed
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken
Hence be gone away
Why dost thou stay
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio
Tybalt that murderer which way ran he
There lies that Tybalt
Speak nephew
Were you by when it began
Where are the vile beginners of this fray
O noble prince I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
There lies the man slain by young Romeo That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio
Tybalt my cousin
O my brother’s child
O cousin cousin
Benvolio who began this bloody fray
Romeo he cries aloud “Hold friends
Friends part” and swifter than his tongue His agile arm beats down their fatal points And ’twixt them rushes underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled
But by and by comes back to Romeo Who had but newly entertained revenge And to ’t they go like lightning for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly
This is the truth or let Benvolio die
He speaks not true
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife And all those twenty could but kill one life
I beg for justice which thou Prince must give
Romeo slew Tybalt
Romeo must not live
Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
His fault concludes but what the law should end The life of Tybalt
I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding
But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses Therefore use none
Bear hence this body and attend our will
Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties or if love be blind It best agrees with night
Come civil night Thou sober suited matron all in black And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold Think true love acted simple modesty
Come night
Come Romeo
Come thou day in night For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back
And when I shall die Take him and cut him out in little stars And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch
Ay ay the cords
Ay me what news
Why dost thou wring thy hands
Ah welladay
We are undone lady we are undone
Alack the day
Can heaven be so envious
Romeo can Though heaven cannot
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus
This torture should be roared in dismal hell
Hath Romeo slain himself
Say thou but “ay” And that bare vowelThan the death darting eye of cockatrice
I am not I if there be such anOr those eyes shut that makes thee answer “ay” If he be slain say “ay” or if not “no” Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
To prison eyes ne'er look on liberty
Vile earth to earth resign
O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had
That ever I should live to see thee dead
Is Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt dead
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banishèd
O God did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood
It did it did
Alas the day it did
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
Dove feathered raven wolvish ravening lamb
O nature what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound
Ah where’s my man Give me some aqua vitae  These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
Shame come to Romeo
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish
He was not born to shame
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned
Sole monarch of the universal earth Oh what a beast was I to chide at him
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin
But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
That villain cousin would have killed my husband
All this is comfort
Wherefore weep I then
I would forget it fain But oh it presses to my memory Like damnèd guilty deeds to sinners' minds
Tybalt is dead and Romeo banishèd”
That “banishèd” that one word “banishèd” Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts
Tybalt’s death Was woe enough if it had ended there
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs Why followed not when she said “Tybalt’s dead” “Thy father” or “thy mother” nay or both Which modern lamentations might have moved
But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death “Romeo is banishèd” To speak that word Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet All slain all dead
Romeo is banishèd” There is no end no limit measure bound In that word’s death
No words can that woe sound
Where is my father and my mother Nurse
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse
Will you go to them
I will bring you thither
Wash they his wounds with tears
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry for Romeo’s banishment
Take up those cords Poor ropes you are beguiled Both you and I for Romeo is exiled
He made you for a highway to my bed But I a maid die maiden widowèd
And death not Romeo take my maidenhead
Hie to your chamber
I’ll find Romeo To comfort you
I wot well where he is
Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night
I’ll to him
He is hid at Lawrence' cell
Romeo come forth
Come forth thou fearful man
Father what news
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom
Ha banishment
Be merciful say “death” For exile hath more terror in his look Much more than death
Do not say “banishment” Hence from Verona art thou banishèd
Be patient for the world is broad and wide
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory torture hell itself
Hence “banishèd” is banished from the world And world’s exile is death
Calling death “banishment” Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me
O deadly sin
O rude unthankfulness
Tis torture and not mercy
More validity More honorable state more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo
Flies may do this but I from this must fly
They are free men but I am banishèd
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death
Hadst thou no poison mixed no sharp ground knife No sudden mean of death though ne'er so mean But “banishèd” to kill me “Banishèd”
O Friar the damnèd use that word in hell
Howling attends it
How hast thou the heart Being a divine a ghostly confessor A sin absolver and my friend professed To mangle me with that word “banishèd”
Thou fond mad man hear me a little speak
Here were the servants of your adversary And yours close fighting ere I did approach
I drew to part them
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows Came more and more and fought on part and part Till the Prince came who parted either part
Oh where is Romeo
Saw you him today
Right glad I am he was not at this fray
Towards him I made but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood
Many a morning hath he there been seen With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
But all so soon as the all cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed Away from light steals home my heavy son
Oh thou wilt speak again of banishment
Talk no more
Oh then I see that madmen have no ears
How should they when that wise men have no eyes
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love An hour but married Tybalt murderèd Doting like me and like me banishèd Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground as I do now Taking the measure of an unmade grave
Arise
One knocks
Good Romeo hide thyself
Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans Mistlike infold me from the search of eyes
Who knocks so hard
Whence come you
What’s your will
O holy Friar O tell me holy Friar Where is my lady’s lord
Where’s Romeo
Oh he is even in my mistress' case Just in her case
O woeful sympathy Piteous predicament
Even so lies she Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
Stand an you be a man
For Juliet’s sake for her sake rise and stand
Why should you fall into so deep an O
Nurse
Ah sir ah sir
Death’s the end of all
Spakest thou of Juliet
How is it with her
Where is she
And how doth she
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love
As if that name Shot from the deadly level of a gun Did murder her as that name’s cursed hand Murdered her kinsman
O tell me Friar tell me In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge
Tell me that I may sack The hateful mansion
Art thou a man
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast
Thou hast amazed me
By my holy order I thought thy disposition better tempered
Hast thou slain Tybalt
Why rail’st thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit Which like a usurer abound’st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
What rouse thee man
Thy Juliet is alive For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead  There art thou happy
Tybalt would kill thee But thou slew’st Tybalt there art thou happy
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile there art thou happy
A pack of blessings light upon thy back Happiness courts thee in her best array
But like a misbehaved and sullen wench Thou pout’st upon thy fortune and thy love
Go get thee to thy love as was decreed
Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
Commend me to thy lady And bid her hasten all the house to bed Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
Romeo is coming
O Lord I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel
Oh what learning is
Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
Hie you make haste for it grows very late
How well my comfort is revived by this
Go hence
Good night
And here stands all your state Either be gone before the watch be set Or by the break of day disguised from hence
Sojourn in Mantua
I’ll find out your man And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here
Give me thy hand
Tis late
Farewell
Things have fall'n out sir so unluckily That we have had no time to move our daughter
Look you she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly And so did I
Well we were born to die
These times of woe afford no time to woo
Madam good night
Commend me to your daughter
I will and know her mind early tomorrow
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness
Sir Paris I will make a desperate tender Of my child’s love
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love And bid her mark you me on Wednesday next  But soft
What day is this
Monday my lord
Monday
Ha ha
Do you like this haste
We’ll keep no great ado a friend or two
For hark you Tybalt being slain so late It may be thought we held him carelessly Being our kinsman if we revel much
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends And there an end
But what say you to Thursday
My lord I would that Thursday were tomorrow
Well get you gone
O' Thursday be it then  Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed
Wilt thou be gone
It is not yet near day
It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
Look love what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
Night’s candles are burnt out and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
Yon light is not daylight I know it I
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer And light thee on thy way to Mantua
Therefore stay yet
Thou need’st not to be gone
Let me be ta'en
Let me be put to death
I am content so thou wilt have it so
I have more care to stay than will to go
Come death and welcome
Let’s talk
It is not day
It is it is
It is the lark that sings so out of tune Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
Some say the lark makes sweet division
This doth not so for she divideth us
More light and light it grows
More light and light more dark and dark our woes
Madam
Nurse
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
The day is broke
Then window let day in and let life out
Farewell farewell
One kiss and I’ll descend
And private in his chamber pens himself Shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out And makes himself an artificial night
My noble uncle do you know the cause
I neither know it nor can learn of him
Have you importuned him by any means
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift Come madam let’s away
Art thou gone so love lord
Oh by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo
Farewell
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings love to thee
Oh think’st thou we shall ever meet again
O God I have an ill divining soul
Methinks I see thee now thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
Either my eyesight fails or thou look’st pale
And trust me love in my eye so do you
Dry sorrow drinks our blood
Adieu adieu
O fortune fortune
All men call thee fickle
Be fickle fortune For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back
Who is ’t that calls
Is it my lady mother
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither
Why how now Juliet
Madam I am not well
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death
What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
Therefore have done
Some grief shows much of love But much of grief shows still some want of wit
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
So shall you feel the loss but not the friend Which you weep for
Feeling so the loss Cannot choose but ever weep the friend
Well girl thou weep’st not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughtered him
What villain madam
That same villain Romeo
That is because the traitor murderer lives
Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death
Then weep no more
I’ll send to one in Mantua Where that same banished runagate doth live Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied
Indeed I never shall be satisfied With Romeo till I behold him dead  Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed
Madam if you could find out but a man To bear a poison I would temper it That Romeo should upon receipt thereof Soon sleep in quiet
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him
Find thou the means and I’ll find such a man
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings girl
And joy comes well in such a needy time
What are they beseech your ladyship
Well well thou hast a careful father child
Madam in happy time what day is that
Marry my child early next Thursday morn The gallant young and noble gentleman The County Paris at Saint Peter’s Church Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
Now by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too He shall not make me there a joyful bride
I wonder at this haste that I must wed Ere he that should be husband comes to woo
I pray you tell my lord and father madam I will not marry yet
And when I do I swear It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate Rather than Paris
These are news indeed
Here comes your father
Tell him so yourself And see how he will take it at your hands
How now
A conduit girl
What still in tears Evermore showering
Have you delivered to her our decree
I would the fool were married to her grave
How will she none
Is she not proud
Doth she not count her blessed Unworthy as she is that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride
Not proud you have but thankful that you have
How how how how
Chopped logic
What is this
Proud” and “I thank you” and “I thank you not” And yet “not proud”
Out you green sickness carrion
Out you baggage
You tallow face
Fie fie
What are you mad
Good Father I beseech you on my knees Hear me with patience but to speak a word
Speak not
Reply not
Do not answer me
Out on her hilding
God in heaven bless her
You are to blame my lord to rate her so
And why my Lady Wisdom
Smatter with your gossips go
I speak no treason
Oh God 'i' good e'en
May not one speak
Peace you mumbling fool
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip’s bowl For here we need it not
You are too hot
God’s bread
It makes me mad
Day night hour tide time work play Alone in company still my care hath been To have her matched
Thursday is near
Lay hand on heart advise
An you be mine I’ll give you to my friend
Trust to ’t bethink you
I’ll not be forsworn
Delay this marriage for a month a week
Or if you do not make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies
Talk not to me for I’ll not speak a word
Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee
O God O Nurse how shall this be prevented
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
How shall that faith return again to earth Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth
Comfort me
Hast thou not a word of joy
Some comfort Nurse
Oh he’s a lovely gentleman
Romeo’s a dishclout to him
An eagle madam Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye As Paris hath
Beshrew my very heart I think you are happy in this second match For it excels your first
Or if it did not Your first is dead or ’twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him
Speakest thou from thy heart
Amen
What
Well thou hast comforted me marvelous much
Go in and tell my lady I am gone Having displeased my father to Lawrence’s cell To make confession and to be absolved
Marry I will and this is wisely done
O most wicked fiend
I’ll to the friar to know his remedy
If all else fail myself have power to die
On Thursday sir
The time is very short
You say you do not know the lady’s mind
I like it not
Now do you know the reason of this haste
Look sir here comes the lady toward my cell
Happily met my lady and my wife
That may be sir when I may be a wife
Good morrow cousin
Is the day so young
But new struck nine
Was that my father that went hence so fast
It was
Not having that which having makes them short
In love
Out
Of love
Where shall we dine O me
That “may be” must be love on Thursday next
What must be shall be
That’s a certain text
Come you to make confession to this Father
To answer that I should confess to you
Do not deny to him that you love me
I will confess to you that I love him
So will ye I am sure that you love me
If I do so it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face
Poor soul thy face is much abused with tears
Thy face is mine and thou hast slandered it
My leisure serves me pensive daughter now  My lord we must entreat the time alone
God shield I should disturb devotion  Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
O Juliet I already know thy grief
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it On Thursday next be married to this county
Tell me not Friar that thou hear’st of this Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise And with this knife I’ll help it presently
Hold then
Wednesday is tomorrow
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
Give me give me
Love give me strength and strength shall help afford
Farewell dear Father
You shall have none ill sir for I’ll try if they can lick their fingers
How canst thou try them so
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me
Go be gone
We shall be much unfurnished for this time
Ay forsooth
See where she comes from shrift with merry look
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon
Send for the county
Go tell him of this
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell And gave him what becomèd love I might Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty
Why I am glad on ’t
This is well
Stand up
Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither  Now afore God this reverend holy friar
Our whole city is much bound to him
Nurse will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow
No not till Thursday
There is time enough
We’ll to church tomorrow
Tis now near night
Tush I will stir about And all things shall be well I warrant thee wife
Go thou to Juliet help to deck up her
I’ll not to bed tonight
Let me alone
I’ll play the housewife for this once
Ay those attires are best
What are you busy ho
Need you my help
For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business
Good night
Farewell God knows when we shall meet again
My dismal scene I needs must act alone
Come vial
What if this mixture do not work at all
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning
Lie thou there
Oh look
Methinks I see my cousin’s ghost Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body Upon a rapier’s point
Stay Tybalt stay
Romeo Romeo Romeo
Here’s drink
I drink to thee
No coz I rather weep
Good heart at what
Why such is love’s transgression
What is it else
A madness most discreet A choking gall and a preserving sweet
Farewell my coz
Soft
I will go along
And if you leave me so you do me wrong
Tut I have lost myself
I am not here
Tell me in sadness who is that you love
What shall I groan and tell thee
Groan
Why no
But sadly tell me who
Hold take these keys and fetch more spices Nurse
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry
Come stir stir stir
The second cock hath crowed
The curfew bell hath rung
Spare not for the cost
Go you cot quean go
Get you to bed faith
You’ll be sick tomorrow For this night’s watching
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause and ne'er been sick
Ay you have been a mouse hunt in your time But I will watch you from such watching now
A jealous hood a jealous hood
Now fellow What is there
Make haste make haste sirrah
I have a head sir that will find out logs And never trouble Peter for the matter
Mass and well said
A merry whoreson ha
Thou shalt be loggerhead Good faith ’tis day
Wife
What ho
What Nurse I say
Go waken Juliet
Go and trim her up
I’ll go and chat with Paris
Hie make haste Make haste
The bridegroom he is come already
Make haste I say
Mistress
What mistress
Juliet Fast I warrant her she  Why lamb
Why lady
Why love I say
Madam
Sweet heart
Why bride
What not a word
You take your pennyworths now
How sound is she asleep
Ay let the county take you in your bed
He’ll fright you up i' faith
Will it not be
What noise is here
O lamentable day
What is the matter
Look look
O heavy day
O me O me
My child my only life Revive look up or I will die with thee  Help help
For shame bring Juliet forth
Her lord is come
She’s dead deceased she’s dead
Alack the day
Alack the day
She’s dead she’s dead she’s dead
Ha
Let me see her
Out alas
She’s cold
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff
Life and these lips have long been separated
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field
O lamentable day
O woeful time
Death that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
Come is the bride ready to go to church
Ready to go but never to return
Death is my son in law
Death is my heir
My daughter he hath wedded
I will die And leave him all
Life living all is Death’s
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face And doth it give me such a sight as this
Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage
But one poor one one poor and loving child But one thing to rejoice and solace in And cruel death hath catched it from my sight
O woe
O woeful woeful woeful day
Never was seen so black a day as this
O woeful day O woeful day
Beguiled divorcèd wrongèd spited slain
Most detestable Death by thee beguiled By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown
O love
O life
Not life but love in death
Despised distressèd hated martyred killed
Uncomfortable time why camest thou now To murder murder our solemnity
My soul and not my child
Dead art thou
Peace ho for shame
Confusion’s cure lives not In these confusions
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid
Now heaven hath all
And all the better is it for the maid
Your part in her you could not keep from death But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
The most you sought was her promotion For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced
And weep ye now seeing she is advanced Above the clouds as high as heaven itself
Oh in this love you love your child so ill That you run mad seeing that she is well
She’s not well married that lives married long But she’s best married that dies married young
Our instruments to melancholy bells Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse And all things change them to the contrary
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill Move them no more by crossing their high will
Faith we may put up our pipes and be gone
Ay by my troth the case may be amended
Not a dump we
Tis no time to play now
You will not then
No
I will then give it you soundly
What will you give us
No money on my faith but the gleek
I will give you the minstrel
Then I will give you the serving creature
Then will I lay the serving creature’s dagger on your pate
I will carry no crotchets
Then have at you with my wit
Answer me like men
Marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound
Prates too What say you James Soundpost
Faith I know not what to say
I will say for you
It is “music with her silver sound” because musicians have no gold for sounding
What a pestilent knave is this same
Hang him Jack
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
Ah me
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy
News from Verona How now Balthasar
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
How doth my lady
Is my father well
How fares my Juliet
That I ask again For nothing can be ill if she be well
Then she is well and nothing can be ill
Her body sleeps in Capels' monument And her immortal part with angels lives
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault And presently took post to tell it you
O pardon me for bringing these ill news Since you did leave it for my office sir
A sick man in sadness makes his will A word ill urged to one that is so ill
In sadness cousin I do love a woman
A right good markman
And she’s fair I love
A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
Well in that hit you miss
She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste For beauty starved with her severity Cuts beauty off from all posterity
She is too fair too wise wisely too fair To merit bliss by making me despair
Be ruled by me
Forget to think of her
O teach me how I should forget to think
Is it e'en so
Then I defy you stars
Thou know’st my lodging
Get me ink and paper And hire post horses
I will hence tonight
I do beseech you sir have patience
Your looks are pale and wild and do import Some misadventure
Tush thou art deceived
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar
No my good lord
No matter
Get thee gone And hire those horses
I’ll be with thee straight
Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight
Let’s see for means
O mischief thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
As I remember this should be the house
Being holiday the beggar’s shop is shut
What ho
Apothecary
Who calls so loud
Come hither man
I see that thou art poor
Hold there is forty ducats
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness And fear’st to die
Famine is in thy cheeks
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
The world is not thy friend nor the world’s law
The world affords no law to make thee rich
Buy food and get thyself in flesh  Come cordial and not poison go with me To Juliet’s grave for there must I use thee
Holy Franciscan Friar
Brother ho
This same should be the voice of Friar John
Welcome from Mantua
What says Romeo
Or if his mind be writ give me his letter
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed
Who bare my letter then to Romeo
Unhappy fortune
Brother I’ll go and bring it thee
Now must I to the monument alone
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake
But I will write again to Mantua And keep her at my cell till Romeo come
Poor living corse closed in a dead man’s tomb
Give me thy torch boy
Hence and stand aloof
Yet put it out for I would not be seen
Give me those flowers
Do as I bid thee go
Yet I will adventure
The boy gives warning something doth approach
What cursèd foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite
What with a torch
Muffle me night awhile
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
I will be gone sir and not trouble you
So shalt thou show me friendship
Take thou that
Good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
Fly hence and leave me
Think upon these gone
Let them affright thee
I beseech thee youth Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury
O be gone
Stay not be gone
Live and hereafter say A madman’s mercy bid thee run away
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here
Wilt thou provoke me
Then have at thee boy
O Lord they fight
I will go call the watch
Open the tomb
Mercutio’s kinsman noble County Paris
What said my man when my betossèd soul Did not attend him as we rode
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet
Said he not so
Or did I dream it so
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave
A grave
Oh no
A lantern slaughtered youth For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light
Death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
Thou art not conquered
O what more favor can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous And that the lean abhorrèd monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour
Here here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids
Oh here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world wearied flesh
Eyes look your last
Arms take your last embrace
Thy drugs are quick
Thus with a kiss I die
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair
Saint Francis be my speed
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves Who’s there
Here’s one a friend and one that knows you well
Bliss be upon you
Tell me good my friend What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls
As I discern It burneth in the Capels' monument
Who is it
Romeo
How long hath he been there
Full half an hour
Go with me to the vault
I dare not sir
Stay then
I’ll go alone
Fear comes upon me
Oh much I fear some ill unthrifty thing
As I did sleep under this yew tree here I dreamt my master and another fought And that my master slew him
Romeo  Alack alack what blood is this which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher
O comfortable Friar
Where is my lord
I do remember well where I should be And there I am
Where is my Romeo
I hear some noise
Lady come from that nest Of death contagion and unnatural sleep
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents
Come come away
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead And Paris too
Come I’ll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
A cup closed in my true love’s hand
Poison I see hath been his timeless end  O churl drunk all and left no friendly drop To help me after
I will kiss thy lips
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them To make me die with a restorative
Yea noise
Then I’ll be brief
O happy dagger This is thy sheath
There rust and let me die
This is the place
There where the torch doth burn
The ground is bloody Search about the churchyard
Pitiful sight
Here lies the county slain And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead Who here hath lain these two days buried  Go tell the Prince
Run to the Capulets
Raise up the Montagues
Some others search
Here’s Romeo’s man
We found him in the churchyard
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither
Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard’s side
A great suspicion
Stay the friar too
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad
Oh the people in the street cry “Romeo” Some “Juliet” and some “Paris” and all run With open outcry toward our monument
Search seek and know how this foul murder comes
O heavens
O wife look how our daughter bleeds
This dagger hath mista'en for lo his house Is empty on the back of Montague And it mis sheathèd in my daughter’s bosom
O me
This sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulcher
Alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopped her breath
What further woe conspires against mine age
Look and thou shalt see
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring their head their true descent And then will I be general of your woes And lead you even to death
Meantime forbear And let mischance be slave to patience  Bring forth the parties of suspicion
I am the greatest able to do least Yet most suspected as the time and place Doth make against me of this direful murder
And here I stand both to impeach and purge Myself condemnèd and myself excused
Then say at once what thou dost know in this
I will be brief for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale
Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrowed grave Being the time the potion’s force should cease
What can he say in this
Their course of love the tidings of her death
Montague
O brother Montague give me thy hand
But now my lord what say you to my suit
But saying o'er what I have said before
My child is yet a stranger in the world
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
Younger than she are happy mothers made
And too soon marred are those so early made
But woo her gentle Paris get her heart
This night I hold an old accustomed feast Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star crossed lovers take their life Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents' strife
The fearful passage of their death marked love And the continuance of their parents' rage Which but their children’s end naught could remove Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage  The which if you with patient ears attend What here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house
Go sirrah trudge about Through fair Verona
Find them out whose names are written here
It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ
Take thou some new infection to thy eye And the rank poison of the old will die
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that
For what I pray thee
Why Romeo art thou mad
Not mad but bound more than a madman is Shut up in prison kept without my food Whipped and tormented and Good e'en good fellow
God 'i' good e'en
I pray sir can you read
Ay mine own fortune in my misery
Perhaps you have learned it without book
But I pray can you read anything you see
Ay if I know the letters and the language
Ye say honestly
Stay fellow
I can read
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters County Anselme and his beauteous sisters The lady widow of Vitruvio Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces Mercutio and his brother Valentine Mine uncle Capulet his wife and daughters My fair niece Rosaline and Livia
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt Lucio and the lively Helena” A fair assembly
Whither should they come
Up
Whither
To supper
To our house
Whose house
My master’s
Indeed I should have asked thee that before
Now I’ll tell you without asking
My master is the great rich Capulet and if you be not of the house of Montagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine
Rest you merry
At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona
Go thither and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show And I will make thee think thy swan a crow
One fairer than my love
The all seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun
I’ll go along no such sight to be shown But to rejoice in splendor of mine own
Nurse where’s my daughter
Call her forth to me
Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come
What lamb
How now who calls
Your mother
Madam I am here
What is your will
Thou know’st my daughter’s of a pretty age
Faith I can tell her age unto an hour
She’s not fourteen
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth and yet to my teen be it spoken I have but four she is not fourteen
Even or odd of all days in the year Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
Susan and she God rest all Christian souls  Were of an age
Well Susan is with God
She was too good for me
But as I said On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
That shall she
Marry I remember it well
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years And she was weaned I never shall forget it  Of all the days of the year upon that day
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
My lord and you were then at Mantua  Nay I do bear a brain But as I said When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
Shake” quoth the dovehouse
Twas no need I trow To bid me trudge
Yea” quoth he “Dost thou fall upon thy face
And pretty fool it stinted and said “ay” Enough of this
I pray thee hold thy peace
Yes madam
Yet I cannot choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say “ay” And yet I warrant it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone A perilous knock and it cried bitterly
Yea” quoth my husband “Fall’st upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
Wilt thou not Jule” It stinted and said “ay” And stint thou too I pray thee Nurse say I
God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed
An I might live to see thee married once I have my wish
Tell me daughter Juliet How stands your disposition to be married
It is an honor that I dream not of
Well think of marriage now
Younger than you Here in Verona ladies of esteem Are made already mothers
By my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid
Thus then in brief The valiant Paris seeks you for his love
A man young lady
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower
What say you
I’ll look to like if looking liking move
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly
I must hence to wait
I beseech you follow straight
We follow thee Juliet the county stays
Go girl seek happy nights to happy days
What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
Or shall we on without apology
The date is out of such prolixity
But let them measure us by what they will
Give me a torch
I am not for this ambling
Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance
Not I believe me
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move
You are a lover
Borrow Cupid’s wings And soar with them above a common bound
I am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft To soar with his light feathers and so bound I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink
I mean an we be in choler we’ll draw
I strike quickly being moved
But thou art not quickly moved to strike
To move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand
A dog of that house shall move me to stand
And to sink in it should you burthen love  Too great oppression for a tender thing
Is love a tender thing
It is too rough Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
If love be rough with you be rough with love
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
Come we burn daylight ho
Nay that’s not so
We waste our lights in vain like lights by day
And we mean well in going to this mask But ’tis no wit to go
Why may one ask
I dreamt a dream tonight
And so did I
Well what was yours
That dreamers often lie
In bed asleep while they do dream things true
Oh then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier’s nose And then dreams he of smelling out a suit
And sometime comes she with a tithe pig’s tail Tickling a parson’s nose as he lies asleep Then he dreams of another benefice
This is she     Peace peace Mercutio peace
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
Supper is done and we shall come too late
On lusty gentlemen
Strike drum
Where’s Potpan that he helps not to take away
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands and they unwashed too ’tis a foul thing
Away with the joint stools remove the court cupboard look to the plate
Good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as thou loves me let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell Antony and Potpan
Ay boy ready
You are looked for and called for asked for and sought for in the great chamber
We cannot be here and there too
Cheerly boys
Be brisk 0awhile and the longer liver take all
Welcome gentlemen
She that makes dainty She I’ll swear hath corns
Am I come near ye now  Welcome gentlemen
By'r Lady thirty years
Tis more ’tis more
His son is elder sir
His son is thirty
Will you tell me that
His son was but a ward two years ago
I know not sir
Oh she doth teach the torches to burn bright
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night
This by his voice should be a Montague  What dares the slave Come hither covered with an antic face To fleer and scorn at our solemnity
Wherefore storm you so
Uncle this is a Montague our foe A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night
Young Romeo is it
Tis he that villain Romeo
Content thee gentle coz
Let him alone
He bears him like a portly gentleman And to say truth Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well governed youth
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement
Therefore be patient
Take no note of him
You’ll not endure him
Why uncle ’tis a shame
Go to go to
You are a saucy boy
Is ’t so indeed
This trick may chance to scathe you I know what
You must contrary me
I’ll make you quiet What cheerly my hearts
Have not saints lips and holy palmers too
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
O then dear saint let lips do what hands do
They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
Saints do not move though grant for prayers' sake
Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take
Thus from my lips by thine my sin is purged
Then have my lips the sin that they have took
Sin from thy lips
Give me my sin again
You kiss by th' book
Madam your mother craves a word with you
What is her mother
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal
I tell you he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks
Nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards  Is it e'en so
I’ll to my rest
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men
Tis all one
I will show myself a tyrant
The heads of the maids
Ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads
Take it in what sense thou wilt
They must take it in sense that feel it
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh
Tis well thou art not fish
Draw thy tool
My naked weapon is out
Come hither Nurse
What is yond gentleman
The son and heir of old Tiberio
What’s he that now is going out of door
Marry that I think be young Petruchio
I know not
Go ask his name If he be married
What’s this
What’s this
The strangers all are gone
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks But to his foe supposed he must complain And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks
And she as much in love her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere
But passion lends them power time means to meet Tempering extremities with extreme sweet
Can I go forward when my heart is here
He is wise And on my life hath stol'n him home to bed
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall
Call good Mercutio
Nay I’ll conjure too
Romeo
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
Cry but “Ay me” Pronounce but “love” and “dove” Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word One nickname for her purblind son and heir Young Abraham Cupid he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid  He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
This cannot anger him
My invocation Is fair and honest
Blind is his love and best befits the dark
If love be blind love cannot hit the mark
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone  O Romeo that she were
Go then for ’tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it
Cast it off
It is my lady
Oh it is my love
Oh that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing
What of that
Her eye discourses
Tis not to me she speaks
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven Having some business do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
Oh that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek
O Romeo Romeo
Wherefore art thou Romeo
Tis but thy name that is my enemy
Henceforth I never will be Romeo
What man art thou that thus bescreened in night So stumblest on my counsel
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb And the place death considering who thou art If any of my kinsmen find thee here
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me
If they do see thee they will murder thee
Look thou but sweet And I am proof against their enmity
I would not for the world they saw thee here
My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd wanting of thy love
Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
Dost thou love me
I know thou wilt say “ay” And I will take thy word
What shall I swear by
Do not swear at all
Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self Which is the god of my idolatry And I’ll believe thee
If my heart’s dear love  Well do not swear
Although I joy in thee I have no joy of this contract tonight
This bud of love by summer’s ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight
Th' exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it And yet I would it were to give again
Wouldst thou withdraw it
For what purpose love
But to be frank and give it thee again
And yet I wish but for the thing I have
My bounty is as boundless as the sea My love as deep
I hear some noise within
Dear love adieu  Anon good Nurse Sweet Montague be true
Stay but a little
I will come again
O blessèd blessèd night
I am afeard Being in night all this is but a dream Too flattering sweet to be substantial
Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
Fear me not
Let us take the law of our sides
Let them begin
I will frown as I pass by and let them take it as they list
Nay as they dare
I will bite my thumb at them which is a disgrace to them if they bear it
Do you bite your thumb at us sir
I do bite my thumb sir
Do you bite your thumb at us sir
Do you quarrel sir
Quarrel sir
No sir
Tomorrow will I send
So thrive my soul  A thousand times good night
A thousand times the worse to want thy light
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of “My Romeo” It is my soul that calls upon my name
How silver sweet sound lovers' tongues by night Like softest music to attending ears
Romeo
My nyas
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee
By the hour of nine
I will not fail
Tis twenty year till then
I have forgot why I did call thee back
Let me stand here till thou remember it
And I’ll still stay to have thee still forget Forgetting any other home but this
Tis almost morning
And yet no further than a wanton’s bird That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves And with a silken thread plucks it back again So loving jealous of his liberty
I would I were thy bird
Sweet so would I
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
Good night good night
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell His help to crave and my dear hap to tell
The gray eyed morn smiles on the frowning night Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels
Now ere the sun advance his burning eye The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious juicèd flowers
The earth that’s nature’s mother is her tomb
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find Many for many virtues excellent None but for some and yet all different
Oh mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs plants stones and their true qualities
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied And vice sometime by action dignified
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power
Two such opposèd kings encamp them still In man as well as herbs grace and rude will
And where the worser is predominant Full soon the canker death eats up that plant
Good morrow Father
Benedicite
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
Young son it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye And where care lodges sleep will never lie
But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature
Or if not so then here I hit it right Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight
That last is true
The sweeter rest was mine
With Rosaline my ghostly Father
That’s my good son
But where hast thou been then
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies
I bear no hatred blessèd man for lo My intercession likewise steads my foe
Here comes your father
Never make denial
I must and will have Katherine to my wife
Now Signior Petruchio how speed you with my daughter
How but well sir
Why how now daughter Katherine
In your dumps
Call you me daughter
Father ’tis thus yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her
I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first
Hark Petruchio she says she’ll see thee hanged first
Is this your speeding
Nay then good night our part
Be patient gentlemen
I choose her for myself
If she and I be pleased what’s that to you
Tis bargained ’twixt us twain being alone That she shall still be curst in company
I tell you ’tis incredible to believe How much she loves me
O the kindest Kate
O you are novices
Tis a world to see How tame when men and women are alone A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew  Give me thy hand Kate
I will unto Venice To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding day
God send you joy Petruchio
Tis a match
Amen say we
We will be witnesses
Father and wife and gentlemen adieu
I will to Venice
Sunday comes apace
We will be married o' Sunday
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas
The gain I seek is quiet in the match
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
But now Baptista to your younger daughter
Now is the day we long have lookèd for
I am your neighbor and was suitor first
Youngling thou canst not love so dear as I Graybeard thy love doth freeze
But thine doth fry
Skipper stand back
Tis age that nourisheth
Content you gentlemen
I will compound this strife
First as you know my house within the city Is richly furnishèd with plate and gold Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns In cypress chests my arras counterpoints Costly apparel tents and canopies Fine linen Turkey cushions bossed with pearl Valance of Venice gold in needlework Pewter and brass and all things that belong To house or housekeeping
Then at my farm I have a hundred milch kine to the pail Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls And all things answerable to this portion
Two thousand ducats by the year of land
Nay I have offered all I have no more And she can have no more than all I have
I must confess your offer is the best And let your father make her the assurance She is your own else you must pardon me
If you should die before him where’s her dower
And may not young men die as well as old
Well gentlemen I am thus resolved On Sunday next you know My daughter Katherina is to be married
I think ’twas Soto that your Honor means
Tis very true
Thou didst it excellent
There is a lord will hear you play tonight But I am doubtful of your modesties Lest over eyeing of his odd behavior  For yet his Honor never heard a play  You break into some merry passion And so offend him
Go sirrah take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one
Adieu good neighbor
Sirrah young gamester your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age Set foot under thy table
Tut a toy
An old Italian fox is not so kind my boy
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide
Fathers commonly Do get their children
But in this case of wooing A child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned
Where left we last
Here madam Conster them
Now let me see if I can conster it
I must believe my master else I promise you I should be arguing still upon that doubt
But let it rest Now Litio to you
Good master take it not unkindly pray That I have been thus pleasant with you both
Call you this “gamut”
Tut I like it not
Old fashions please me best
Mistress your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister’s chamber up
You know tomorrow is the wedding day
Farewell sweet masters both
I must be gone
But I have cause to pry into this pedant
Methinks he looks as though he were in love
No shame but mine
Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say “Lo there is mad Petruchio’s wife If it would please him come and marry her” Upon my life Petruchio means but well Whatever fortune stays him from his word Though he be blunt I know him passing wise Though he be merry yet withal he’s honest
Would Katherine had never seen him though
Go girl
I cannot blame thee now to weep For such an injury would vex a very saint Much more a shrew of thy impatient humor
Master master
News old news and such news as you never heard of
Is it new and old too
How may that be
Why is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming
Is he come
Why no sir
What then
He is coming
When will he be here
When he stands where I am and sees you there
Who comes with him
A monster a very monster in apparel and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey
I am glad he’s come howsoe'er he comes
Why sir he comes not
Didst thou not say he comes
Who
That Petruchio came
Ay that Petruchio came
No sir I say his horse comes with him on his back
Why that’s all one
Nay by Saint Jamy I hold you a penny A horse and a man Is more than one And yet not many
You are welcome sir
See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst Anon I’ll give thee more instructions
I know the boy will well usurp the grace Voice gait and action of a gentlewoman
I long to hear him call the drunkard “husband” And how my men will stay themselves from laughter When they do homage to this simple peasant
I’ll in to counsel them
Where is my love
Why sir you know this is your wedding day
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear
But where is Kate
I stay too long from her
See not your bride in these unreverent robes
Go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
Not I believe me
Thus I’ll visit her
But thus I trust you will not marry her
Good sooth even thus
Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself
But what a fool am I to chat with you When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss
He hath some meaning in his mad attire
We will persuade him be it possible To put on better ere he go to church
I’ll after him and see the event of this
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent
We’ll overreach the graybeard Gremio The narrow prying father Minola The quaint musician amorous Litio All for my master’s sake Lucentio
Signior Gremio came you from the church
As willingly as e'er I came from school
A bridegroom say you
Why he’s a devil a devil a very fiend
Tut she’s a lamb a dove a fool to him
Now take them up” quoth he “if any list” Trembled and shook for why he stamped and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him
But after many ceremonies done He calls for wine
This done he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo
Such a mad marriage never was before
Hark hark
I hear the minstrels play
Is ’t possible you will away tonight
Make it no wonder
If you knew my business You would entreat me rather go than stay
And honest company I thank you all That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient sweet and virtuous wife
Let me entreat you
It cannot be
Let me entreat you
I am content
Are you content to stay
I am content you shall entreat me stay But yet not stay entreat me how you can
Now if you love me stay
Grumio my horse
Ay sir they be ready
The oats have eaten the horses
The door is open sir
There lies your way
For me I’ll not be gone till I please myself
O Kate content thee
Prithee be not angry
I will be angry
What hast thou to do  Father be quiet
He shall stay my leisure
Ay marry sir now it begins to work
Gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist
I’ll buckler thee against a million
Nay let them go a couple of quiet ones
Went they not quickly I should die with laughing
That being mad herself she’s madly mated
Neighbors and friends though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table You know there wants no junkets at the feast
She shall Lucentio
Come gentlemen let’s go
Fie fie on all tired jades on all mad masters and all foul ways
Was ever man so beaten
Was ever man so 'rayed
Was ever man so weary
I am sent before to make a fire and they are coming after to warm them
Now were not I a little pot and soon hot my very lips might freeze to my teeth my tongue to the roof of my mouth my heart in my belly ere I should come by a fire to thaw me
But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself
Who is that calls so coldly
A piece of ice
If thou doubt it thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck
A fire good Curtis
Is my master and his wife coming Grumio
Oh ay Curtis ay and therefore fire fire
Cast on no water
Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported
She was good Curtis before this frost
Why thy horn is a foot and so long am I at the least
I prithee good Grumio tell me how goes the world
Do thy duty and have thy duty for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death
There’s fire ready
And therefore good Grumio the news
Why therefore fire for I have caught extreme cold
Where’s the cook
Is supper ready the house trimmed rushes strewed cobwebs swept the servingmen in their new fustian their white stockings and every officer his wedding garment on
Be the Jacks fair within the Jills fair without the carpets laid and everything in order
For God’s sake a pot of small ale
Will ’t please your Honor taste of these conserves
What raiment will your Honor wear today
I am Christophero Sly
All ready
And therefore I pray thee news
First know my horse is tired my master and mistress fallen out
How
Out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby hangs a tale
Let’s ha' ’t good Grumio
Lend thine ear
Here
There
This ’tis to feel a tale not to hear a tale
And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning
Now I begin Imprimis we came down a foul hill my master riding behind my mistress  Both of one horse
What’s that to thee
Why a horse
Tell thou the tale
Ay and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home
But what talk I of this
Call forth Nathaniel Joseph Nicholas Philip Walter Sugarsop and the rest
Let their heads be slickly combed their blue coats brushed and their garters of an indifferent knit
Let them curtsy with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse tail till they kiss their hands
Are they all ready
They are
Call them forth
Why she hath a face of her own
Who knows not that
Thou it seems that calls for company to countenance her
I call them forth to credit her
Why she comes to borrow nothing of them
Welcome home Grumio
How now Grumio
What Grumio
Fellow Grumio
How now old lad
E'en at hand alighted by this
Where be these knaves
Here here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir” You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms
Where is the foolish knave I sent before
Here sir as foolish as I was before
You peasant swain
You whoreson malt horse drudge
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee
Nathaniel’s coat sir was not fully made And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked i' th' heel
There was no link to color Peter’s hat And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing
There were none fine but Adam Rafe and Gregory
Go rascals go and fetch my supper in
One Kate that you must kiss and be acquainted with  Where are my slippers
Shall I have some water  Come Kate and wash and welcome heartily  You whoreson villain
Will you let it fall
Patience I pray you
Twas a fault unwilling
Will you give thanks sweet Kate or else shall I  What’s this
Mutton
Ay
Who brought it
I
What dogs are these
Where is the rascal cook
How durst you villains bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not
There take it to you trenchers cups and all
I pray you husband be not so disquiet
The meat was well if you were so contented
I tell thee Kate ’twas burnt and dried away
Come I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber
Peter didst ever see the like
He kills her in her own humor
Where is he
Away away for he is coming hither
Thus have I politicly begun my reign And ’tis my hope to end successfully
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty And till she stoop she must not be full gorged For then she never looks upon her lure
Another way I have to man my haggard To make her come and know her keeper’s call
That is to watch her as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient
She ate no meat today nor none shall eat
Last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not
As with the meat some undeservèd fault I’ll find about the making of the bed And here I’ll fling the pillow there the bolster This way the coverlet another way the sheets
And in conclusion she shall watch all night And if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl And with the clamor keep her still awake
He that knows better how to tame a shrew Now let him speak ’tis charity to show
Is ’t possible friend Litio that mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio
What master read you
First resolve me that
And may you prove sir master of your art
I tell thee Litio this is wonderful
Mistake no more
Know sir that I am called Hortensio
See how they kiss and court
Fie on her
See how beastly she doth court him
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn
For me that I may surely keep mine oath I will be married to a wealthy widow Ere three days pass which hath as long loved me As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard
And so farewell Signior Lucentio
Kindness in women not their beauteous looks Shall win my love and so I take my leave In resolution as I swore before
What would you make me mad
Am not I Christopher Sly old Sly’s son of Burton Heath by birth a peddler by education a cardmaker by transmutation a bearherd and now by present profession a tinker
Oh this is it that makes your servants droop
O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment And banish hence these abject lowly dreams
Look how thy servants do attend on thee Each in his office ready at thy beck
Wilt thou have music
Hark
Apollo plays And twenty cagèd nightingales do sing Or wilt thou sleep
We’ll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis
Or wilt thou hunt
Nay I have ta'en you napping gentle love And have forsworn you with Hortensio
Tranio you jest
But have you both forsworn me
Mistress we have
Then we are rid of Litio
I' faith he’ll have a lusty widow now That shall be wooed and wedded in a day
God give him joy
Ay and he’ll tame her
He says so Tranio
The taming school
What is there such a place
Ay mistress and Petruchio is the master That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue
What is he Biondello
And what of him Tranio
Take in your love and then let me alone
God save you sir
You are welcome
Of Mantua
My life sir
how I pray
For that goes hard
Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua
Know you not the cause
Tis marvel but that you are but newly come You might have heard it else proclaimed about
Alas sir it is worse for me than so For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence and must here deliver them
Ay sir in Pisa have I often been Pisa renownèd for grave citizens
O sir I do and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty
In all these circumstances I’ll instruct you
No no forsooth I dare not for my life
The more my wrong the more his spite appears
What did he marry me to famish me
If not elsewhere they meet with charity
But I who never knew how to entreat Nor never needed that I should entreat Am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed
And that which spites me more than all these wants He does it under name of perfect love As who should say if I should sleep or eat 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death
What say you to a neat’s foot
Tis passing good
I prithee let me have it
I fear it is too choleric a meat
Good Grumio fetch it me
I cannot tell
I fear ’tis choleric
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard
Ay but the mustard is too hot a little
Why then the beef and let the mustard rest
Nay then I will not
You shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio
Then both or one or anything thou wilt
Why then the mustard without the beef
Go get thee gone I say
Mistress what cheer
Pluck up thy spirits
Here love thou seest how diligent I am To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee
I am sure sweet Kate this kindness merits thanks
What not a word
Nay then thou lov’st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof
Here take away this dish
I pray you let it stand
I thank you sir
Come mistress Kate I’ll bear you company
Come tailor let us see these ornaments
Lay forth the gown
What news with you sir
Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak
Why this was molded on a porringer
A velvet dish
Fie fie ’tis lewd and filthy
Why ’tis a cockle or a walnut shell A knack a toy a trick a baby’s cap
Away with it
Come let me have a bigger
I’ll have no bigger
When you are gentle you shall have one too And not till then
Why sir I trust I may have leave to speak And speak I will
I am no child no babe
Your betters have endured me say my mind And if you cannot best you stop your ears
Why thou say’st true
It is a paltry cap A custard coffin a bauble a silken pie
I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not
Love me or love me not I like the cap And it I will have or I will have none
Thy gown
Why ay
Come tailor let us see ’t
O mercy God
What’s this
A sleeve
Tis like a demi cannon
What up and down carved like an apple tart
Here’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash Like to a censer in a barber’s shop
Why what i' devil’s name tailor call’st thou this
You bid me make it orderly and well According to the fashion and the time
Marry and did
But if you be remembered I did not bid you mar it to the time
I’ll none of it
Hence make your best of it
I never saw a better fashioned gown More quaint more pleasing nor more commendable
Why true he means to make a puppet of thee
Thou liest thou thread thou thimble Thou yard three quarters half yard quarter nail
Thou flea thou nit thou winter cricket thou
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread
I tell thee I that thou hast marred her gown
Your Worship is deceived
The gown is made Just as my master had direction
Grumio gave order how it should be done
I gave him no order
I gave him the stuff
But how did you desire it should be made
Marry sir with needle and thread
But did you not request to have it cut
Face not me
Thou hast braved many men brave not me
I will neither be faced nor braved
I say unto thee I bid thy master cutout the gown but I did not bid him cut it to pieces
Why here is the note of the fashion to testify
Read it
The note lies in ’s throat if he say I said so
Dost thou love pictures
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'errun her lovely face She was the fairest creature in the world  And yet she is inferior to none
I confess the cape
I confess two sleeves
Ay there’s the villany
Error i' the bill sir error i' the bill
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewed up again and that I’ll prove upon thee though thy little finger be armed in a thimble
I am for thee straight
Take thou the bill give me thy mete  yard and spare not me
God a mercy Grumio
Then he shall have no odds
Well sir in brief the gown is not for me
You are i' the right sir ’tis for my mistress
Go take it up unto thy master’s use
Villain not for thy life
Take up my mistress' gown for thy master’s use
Why sir what’s your conceit in that
O sir the conceit is deeper than you think for
Take up my mistress' gown to his master’s use
O fie fie fie
Well come my Kate
What is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful
Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye
Oh no good Kate
If thou account’st it shame lay it on me And therefore frolic
We will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy father’s house
I dare assure you sir ’tis almost two And ’twill be supper time ere you come there
It shall be seven ere I go to horse
Look what I speak or do or think to do You are still crossing it
Sirs let ’t alone
I will not go today and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is
Ay what else
and but I be deceived Signior Baptista may remember me Near twenty years ago in Genoa Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus
I warrant you
But sir here comes your boy
Tut fear not me
I told him that your father was at Venice And that you looked for him this day in Padua
Here comes Baptista
Set your countenance sir
Signior Baptista you are happily met  Sir this is the gentleman I told you of
I pray you stand good father to me now
Give me Bianca for my patrimony
Sir pardon me in what I have to say
Your plainness and your shortness please me well
Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him Or both dissemble deeply their affections
Your son shall have my daughter with consent
Not in my house Lucentio for you know Pitchers have ears and I have many servants
Besides old Gremio is heark'ning still And happily we might be interrupted
I pray the gods she may with all my heart
Cambio
What sayest thou Biondello
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you
Biondello what of that
I pray thee moralize them
Then thus Baptista is safe talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son
And what of him
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper
And then
The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command at all hours
And what of all this
I cannot tell except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance
Take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum
To th' church take the priest clerk and some sufficient honest witnesses
If this be not that you look for I have no more to say But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit and so may you sir
And so adieu sir
My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix
She will be pleased
Then wherefore should I doubt
It shall go hard if “Cambio” go without her
Come on i' God’s name once more toward our father’s
Good Lord how bright and goodly shines the moon
The moon
The sun
It is not moonlight now
I say it is the moon that shines so bright
I know it is the sun that shines so bright
Now by my mother’s son and that’s myself It shall be moon or star or what I list Or e'er I journey to your father’s house
I say it is the moon
I know it is the moon
Nay then you lie
It is the blessèd sun
Then God be blessed it is the blessèd sun
Petruchio go thy ways the field is won
Well forward forward
Thus the bowl should run And not unluckily against the bias
But soft
Company is coming here
Young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet Whither away or where is thy abode
Happy the parents of so fair a child
Will ’t please your Mightiness to wash your hands
O how we joy to see your wit restored
O that once more you knew but what you are
These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or when you waked so waked as if you slept
These fifteen years
By my fay a goodly nap
But did I never speak of all that time
O yes my lord but very idle words
Why sir you know no house nor no such maid Nor no such men as you have reckoned up As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell And twenty more such names and men as these Which never were nor no man ever saw
Why how now Kate
I hope thou art not mad
This is a man old wrinkled faded withered  And not a maiden as thou say’st he is
Fair sir and you my merry mistress That with your strange encounter much amazed me My name is called Vincentio my dwelling Pisa And bound I am to Padua there to visit A son of mine which long I have not seen
What is his name
Lucentio gentle sir
Happily met the happier for thy son
The sister to my wife this gentlewoman Thy son by this hath married
Wonder not Nor be grieved
Let me embrace with old Vincentio And wander we to see thy honest son Who will of thy arrival be full joyous
I do assure thee father so it is
Well Petruchio this has put me in heart
Softly and swiftly sir for the priest is ready
I fly Biondello
Nay faith I’ll see the church a' your back and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while
Sir here’s the door
This is Lucentio’s house
My father’s bears more toward the marketplace
Thither must I and here I leave you sir
You shall not choose but drink before you go
They’re busy within
You were best knock louder
Is Signior Lucentio within sir
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal
Hope I may choose sir
Come hither you rogue
What have you forgot me
Forgot you
No sir
I could not forget you for I never saw you before in all my life
What my old worshipful old master
Yes marry sir
See where he looks out of the window
Is ’t so indeed
Help help help
Here’s a madman will murder me
Oh I am undone I am undone
What is the man lunatic
Thy father
O villain
He is a sailmaker in Bergamo
You mistake sir you mistake sir
Pray what do you think is his name
His name
Lucentio
Oh he hath murdered his master
O my son my son
Tell me thou villain where is my son Lucentio
Carry this mad knave to the jail Father Baptista I charge you see that he be forthcoming
Carry me to the jail
He shall not go to prison
Talk not Signior Gremio
I say he shall go to prison
Take heed Signior Baptista lest you be cony catched in this business
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio
Nay I dare not swear it
Yes I know thee to be Signior Lucentio
Away with the dotard
To the jail with him
O
We are spoiled and yonder he is
Pardon sweet father
Lives my sweet son
Pardon dear father
How hast thou offended
Where is Lucentio
Here’s Lucentio right son to the right Vincentio That have by marriage made thy daughter mine While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne
Here’s packing with a witness to deceive us all
Where is that damnèd villain Tranio That faced and braved me in this matter so
Why tell me is not this my Cambio
Cambio is changed into Lucentio
Love wrought these miracles
Bianca’s love Made me exchange my state with Tranio While he did bear my countenance in the town And happily I have arrivèd at the last Unto the wishèd haven of my bliss
What Tranio did myself enforced him to
Then pardon him sweet father for my sake
I’ll slit the villain’s nose that would have sent me to the jail
But do you hear sir have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill
Fear not Baptista we will content you
Go to
My cake is dough but I’ll in among the rest Out of hope of all but my share of the feast
Husband let’s follow to see the end of this ado
First kiss me Kate and we will
What in the midst of the street
What art thou ashamed of me
No sir God forbid but ashamed to kiss
Why then let’s home again
Nay I will give thee a kiss
Is not this well
Come my sweet Kate
Better once than never for never too late
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends
Amen
I thank thee
Thou shalt not lose by it
How fares my noble lord
Marry I fare well For here is cheer enough
Where is my wife
Here noble lord
What is thy will with her
Are you my wife and will not call me “husband”
My men should call me “lord” I am your goodman
My fair Bianca bid my father welcome While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine
My banquet is to close our stomachs up After our great good cheer
Pray you sit down For now we sit to chat as well as eat
Nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat
For both our sakes I would that word were true
Now for my life Hortensio fears his widow
You are very sensible and yet you miss my sense I mean Hortensio is afeard of you
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round
Roundly replied
Mistress how mean you that
Thus I conceive by him
Very well mended
Kiss him for that good widow
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round”  I pray you tell me what you meant by that
Your husband being troubled with a shrew Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe
And now you know my meaning
A very mean meaning
Right I mean you
To her widow
A hundred marks my Kate does put her down
That’s my office
Spoke like an officer
Ha' to thee lad
How likes Gremio these quick witted folks
Believe me sir they butt together well
Ay but not frighted me
Therefore I’ll sleep again
Nay that you shall not
Am I your bird
She hath prevented me
Here Signior Tranio This bird you aimed at though you hit her not  Therefore a health to all that shot and missed
A good swift simile but something currish
Tis well sir that you hunted for yourself
Tranio hits you now
I thank thee for that gird good Tranio
He has a little galled me I confess
And as the jest did glance away from me 'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright
Now in good sadness son Petruchio I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all
Well I say no
Content
What’s the wager
Twenty crowns
Twenty crowns
I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound But twenty times so much upon my wife
A hundred then
Content
A match
Tis done
Who shall begin
That will I
Go Biondello bid your mistress come to me
I go
Son I’ll be your half Bianca comes
I’ll have no halves
How
She’s busy and she cannot come” Is that an answer
Ay and a kind one too
Pray God sir your wife send you not a worse
I hope better
Now where’s my wife
She says you have some goodly jest in hand
She will not come
She bids you come to her
Worse and worse
I know her answer
What
She will not
Now by my holidam here comes Katherina
What is your will sir that you send for me
Where is your sister and Hortensio’s wife
They sit conferring by the parlor fire
Go fetch them hither
If they deny to come Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
Here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder
And so it is
I wonder what it bodes
Marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life And awful rule and right supremacy And to be short what not that’s sweet and happy
Now fair befall thee good Petruchio
The wager thou hast won and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns Another dowry to another daughter For she is changed as she had never been
See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion  Katherine that cap of yours becomes you not
Off with that bauble throw it underfoot
Lord let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly pass
Fie
What a foolish duty call you this
I would your duty were as foolish too
The wisdom of your duty fair Bianca Hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime
The more fool you for laying on my duty
We will have no telling
She shall not
I say she shall And first begin with her
Fie fie
Unknit that threat'ning unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord thy king thy governor
Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband
And when she is froward peevish sullen sour And not obedient to his honest will What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord
I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve love and obey
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth Unapt to toil and trouble in the world But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts
Come come you froward and unable worms
My mind hath been as big as one of yours My heart as great my reason haply more To bandy word for word and frown for frown
But now I see our lances are but straws Our strength as weak our weakness past compare That seeming to be most which we indeed least are
Come on and kiss me Kate
Tis a good hearing when children are toward
But a harsh hearing when women are froward
Come Kate we’ll to bed
We three are married but you two are sped
Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so
Madam wife they say that I have dreamed And slept above some fifteen year or more
Ay and the time seems thirty unto me Being all this time abandoned from your bed
Tis much Servants leave me and her alone
Madam undress you and come now to bed
Thrice noble lord let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two Or if not so until the sun be set
For your physicians have expressly charged In peril to incur your former malady That I should yet absent me from your bed
I hope this reason stands for my excuse
Ay it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long
But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again
Your Honor’s players hearing your amendment Are come to play a pleasant comedy For so your doctors hold it very meet Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
Let them play it
What household stuff
It is a kind of history
Well we’ll see ’t
We shall ne'er be younger
Pisa renownèd for grave citizens Gave me my being and my father first A merchant of great traffic through the world Vincentio come of the Bentivolii
I’ll pheeze you in faith
A pair of stocks you rogue
Y'are a baggage the Slys are no rogues
ThereforeYou will not pay for the glasses you have burst
No not a denier
Go by Saint Jeronimy
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee
I know my remedy
I’ll not budge an inch boy
Let him come and kindly
Gramercies Tranio well dost thou advise
But stay awhile
What company is this
Master some show to welcome us to town
I' faith sir you shall never need to fear
But if it were doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three legged stool And paint your face and use you like a fool
From all such devils good Lord deliver us
And me too good Lord
Maid’s mild behavior and sobriety
Sister content you in my discontent  Sir to your pleasure humbly I subscribe
My books and instruments shall be my company On them to look and practice by myself
Hark Tranio
Signior Baptista will you be so strange
Why will you mew her up Signior Baptista for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue
And for I know she taketh most delight In music instruments and poetry Schoolmasters will I keep within my house Fit to instruct her youth
And so farewell Katherina you may stay For I have more to commune with Bianca
Why and I trust I may go too may I not
What shall I be appointed hours as though belike I knew not what to take and what to leave ha
You may go to the devil’s dam
Farewell
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love to labor and effect one thing specially
What’s that I pray
Marry sir to get a husband for her sister
A husband
A devil
I say a husband
I say a devil
Think’st thou Hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell
Tush Gremio
Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enough
I cannot tell
How say you Signior Gremio
I am agreed and would I had given him the best horse inv Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the house of her
Come on
I pray sir tell me is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold
O Tranio till I found it to be true I never thought it possible or likely
Affection is not rated from the heart
If love have touched you naught remains but so Gramercies lad go forward
This contents
The rest will comfort for thy counsel’s sound
Master you looked so longly on the maid Perhaps you marked not what’s the pith of all
Oh yes I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand
Saw you no more
Tranio I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air
Ah Tranio what a cruel father’s he
But art thou not advised he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
Ay marry am I sir and now ’tis plotted
I have it Tranio
Master for my hand Both our inventions meet and jump in one
Tell me thine first
You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid That’s your device
It is
May it be done
Not possible
Tis hatched and shall be so
When Biondello comes he waits on thee But I will charm him first to keep his tongue
Where have I been
Nay how now where are you
Sirrah come hither ’tis no time to jest And therefore frame your manners to the time
You understand me
Aye sir
And not a jot of “Tranio” in your mouth
Would I were so too
So could I faith boy to have the next wish after That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter
But sirrah not for my sake but your master’s I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies
When I am alone why then I am Tranio But in all places else your master Lucentio
Tranio let’s go
One thing more rests that thyself execute to make one among these wooers
If thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty
My lord you nod
You do not mind the play
A good matter surely
Comes there any more of it
Tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady
Would ’twere done
Huntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds
Breathe Merriman the poor cur is embossed And couple Clowder with the deep mouthed brach
Why Belman is as good as he my lord
Trust me I take him for the better dog
Thou art a fool
If Echo were as fleet I would esteem him worth a dozen such
But sup them well and look unto them all
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again
I will my lord
What’s here
One dead or drunk
See doth he breathe
He breathes my lord
Were he not warmed with ale This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly
Grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image
Sirs I will practice on this drunken man
Verona for a while I take my leave To see my friends in Padua but of all My best belovèd and approvèd friend Hortensio
And I trow this is his house
Here sirrah Grumio
Knock I say
Knock sir
Whom should I knock
Is there any man has rebused your Worship
Knock you here sir
Villain I say knock me at this gate And rap me well or I’ll knock your knave’s pate
My master is grown quarrelsome
How now what’s the matter
My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio
How do you all at Verona
Signior Hortensio come you to part the fray
Nay ’tis no matter sir what he 'leges in Latin
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it
Knock at the gate
O heavens
Spake you not these words plain “Sirrah knock me here rap me here knock me well and knock me soundly”
And come you now with “knocking at the gate”
Petruchio patience
I am Grumio’s pledge
Why this' a heavy chance ’twixt him and you Your ancient trusty pleasant servant Grumio
And tell me now sweet friend what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona
Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home Where small experience grows
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home And so am come abroad to see the world
Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich And very rich
But thou'rt too much my friend And I’ll not wish thee to her
Signior Hortensio ’twixt such friends as we Few words suffice
I can Petruchio help thee to a wife With wealth enough and young and beauteous Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
Her only fault and that is faults enough Is that she is intolerable curst And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure That were my state far worser than it is I would not wed her for a mine of gold
Hortensio peace
Thou know’st not gold’s effect
Her father is Baptista Minola An affable and courteous gentleman
Her name is Katherina Minola Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue
I know her father though I know not her And he knew my deceasèd father well
I will not sleep Hortensio till I see her And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter Unless you will accompany me thither
Tarry Petruchio I must go with thee For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is
He hath the jewel of my life in hold His youngest daughter beautiful Bianca And her withholds from me and other more Suitors to her and rivals in my love Supposing it a thing impossible For those defects I have before rehearsed That ever Katherina will be wooed
Katherine the curst” A title for a maid of all titles the worst
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music to instruct Bianca That so I may by this device at least Have leave and leisure to make love to her And unsuspected court her by herself
Here’s no knavery
Master master look about you
Who goes there ha
Peace Grumio
It is the rival of my love
Petruchio stand by a while
O this learning what a thing it is
And you are well met Signior Hortensio
Trow you whither I am going
To Baptista Minola
Tis well
And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another A fine musician to instruct our mistress
Gremio ’tis now no time to vent our love
So said so done is well
Hortensio have you told him all her faults
I know she is an irksome brawling scold
If that be all masters I hear no harm
No
Say’st me so friend
What countryman
My father dead my fortune lives for me
And I do hope good days and long to see
O sir such a life with such a wife were strange
But if you have a stomach to ’t i' God’s name You shall have me assisting you in all
But will you woo this wildcat
Why came I hither but to that intent
Have I not heard the sea puffed up with winds Rage like an angry boar chafèd with sweat
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies
Hortensio hark
And so we will provided that he win her
I would I were as sure of a good dinner
He that has the two fair daughters is ’t he you mean
Not her that chides sir at any hand I pray
Sir a word ere you go
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no
An if I be sir is it any offense
No if without more words you will get you hence
For this reason if you’ll know That she’s the choice love of Signior Gremio
That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio
Softly my masters
If you be gentlemen Do me this right hear me with patience
Baptista is a noble gentleman To whom my father is not all unknown And were his daughter fairer than she is She may more suitors have and me for one
Believe me lord I think he cannot choose
It would seem strange unto him when he waked
Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy
Then take him up and manage well the jest
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
My lord I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is
Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers Then well one more may fair Bianca have
This gentleman will out talk us all
Hortensio to what end are all these words
Yea leave that labor to great Hercules And let it be more than Alcides' twelve
Sir you say well and well you do conceive
O excellent motion
Fellows let’s be gone
The motion’s good indeed and be it so  Petruchio I shall be your
Good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself To make a bondmaid and a slave of me
That I disdain
See thou dissemble not
Minion thou liest
Is ’t not Hortensio
Oh then belike you fancy riches more
You will have Gremio to keep you fair
Is it for him you do envy me so
What in my sight Bianca get thee in
What will you not suffer me
Talk not to me
But who comes here
Good morrow neighbor Baptista
Good morrow neighbor Gremio God save you gentlemen
And you good sir
Pray have you not a daughter Called Katherina fair and virtuous
I have a daughter sir called Katherina
You wrong me Signior Gremio
Give me leave  I am a gentleman of Verona sir That hearing of her beauty and her wit Her affability and bashful modesty Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard
You’re welcome sir and he for your good sake
But for my daughter Katherine this I know She is not for your turn the more my grief
I see you do not mean to part with her Or else you like not of my company
Mistake me not
I speak but as I find
Whence are you sir
What may I call your name
Petruchio is my name Antonio’s son A man well known throughout all Italy
I know him well
You are welcome for his sake
Oh pardon me Signior Gremio I would fain be doing
I doubt it not sir but you will curse your wooing  Neighbor this is a gift very grateful I am sure of it
To express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young scholar
A thousand thanks Signior Gremio
Welcome good Cambio
Lucentio is your name
Of whence I pray
A mighty man of Pisa
By report I know him well
You are very welcome sir
We will go walk a little in the orchard And then to dinner
You are passing welcome And so I pray you all to think yourselves
Signior Baptista my business asketh haste And every day I cannot come to woo
You knew my father well and in him me Left solely heir to all his lands and goods Which I have bettered rather than decreased
Then tell me if I get your daughter’s love What dowry shall I have with her to wife
After my death the one half of my lands And in possession twenty thousand crowns
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us That covenants may be kept on either hand
Ay when the special thing is well obtained That is her love for that is all in all
Why that is nothing
For I tell you father I am as peremptory as she proud minded And where two raging fires meet together They do consume the thing that feeds their fury
So I to her and so she yields to me For I am rough and woo not like a babe
Well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
But be thou armed for some unhappy words
Ay to the proof as mountains are for winds That shakes not though they blow perpetually
How now my friend why dost thou look so pale
What will my daughter prove a good musician
I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier
Why then thou canst not break her to the lute
I’ll fume with them” And with that word she struck me on the head And through the instrument my pate made way
Now by the world it is a lusty wench
I love her ten times more than e'er I did
Oh how I long to have some chat with her
I pray you do
I’ll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes
Say that she rail why then I’ll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale
Say that she frown I’ll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew
Say she be mute and will not speak a word Then I’ll commend her volubility And say she uttereth piercing eloquence
If she do bid me pack I’ll give her thanks As though she bid me stay by her a week
If she deny to wed I’ll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be marrièd
Take him up gently and to bed with him And each one to his office when he wakes
Sirrah go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds
Belike some noble gentleman that means Traveling some journey to repose him here
An’t please your Honor players That offer service to your Lordship
Bid them come near
Now fellows you are welcome
We thank your Honor
Do you intend to stay with me tonight
So please your Lordship to accept our duty
With all my heart
This fellow I remember Since once he played a farmer’s eldest son
Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well
I have forgot your name but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed
Good morrow Kate for that’s your name I hear
Well have you heard but something hard of hearing
Moved” in good time
I knew you at the first You were a moveable
Why what’s a moveable
A joint stool
Thou hast hit it
Come sit on me
Asses are made to bear and so are you
Women are made to bear and so are you
No such jade as you if me you mean
Alas good Kate I will not burden thee For knowing thee to be but young and light  Too light for such a swain as you to catch And yet as heavy as my weight should be
Should be” should buzz
If I be waspish best beware my sting
My remedy is then to pluck it out
Ay if the fool could find it where it lies
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting
In his tail
In his tongue
Whose tongue
Yours if you talk of tales
What with my tongue in your tail
Nay come again Good Kate
That I’ll try
I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again
So may you lose your arms
No cock of mine
Nay come Kate come
You must not look so sour
It is my fashion when I see a crab
Why here’s no crab and therefore look not sour
There is there is
Then show it me
Had I a glass I would
What you mean my face
Well aimed of such a young one
Now by Saint George I am too young for you
Yet you are withered
Tis with cares
I care not
Let me go
No not a whit
I find you passing gentle
Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen And now I find report a very liar
Thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers With gentle conference soft and affable
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp
O slanderous world
Kate like the hazel twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
Oh let me see thee walk
Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait
A witty mother
Witless else her son
Am I not wise
For I am he am born to tame you Kate And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates
I should know that voice
It should be But he is drowned and these are devils
Oh defend me
Four legs and two voices a most delicate monster
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend
His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him I will help his ague
Come
Stephano
Doth thy other mouth call me
Mercy mercy
This is a devil and no monster
I will leave him
I have no long spoon
Stephano
If thou beest Stephano touch me and speak to me
For I am Trinculo be not afeard thy good friend Trinculo
If thou beest Trinculo come forth
I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs
If any be Trinculo’s legs these are they
But art thou not drowned Stephano
I hope now thou art not drowned
Is the storm overblown
I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm
And art thou living Stephano
O Stephano two Neapolitans ’scaped
Prithee do not turn me about
My stomach is not constant
Swum ashore man like a duck
I can swim like a duck I’ll be sworn
Here kiss the book
O Stephano hast any more of this
The whole butt man
Hast thou not dropped from heaven
Out o' th' moon I do assure thee
I was the man i' the moon when time was
My mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush
I afeard of him
A very weak monster
The man i' th' moon
A most poor credulous monster Well drawn monster in good sooth
By this light a most perfidious and drunken monster
When ’s god’s asleep he’ll rob his bottle
Come on then
Down and swear
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy headed monster
A most scurvy monster
I could find in my heart to beat him  But that the poor monster’s in drink
An abominable monster
I’ll show thee the best springs
I’ll pluck thee berries
I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve
A most ridiculous monster to make a wonder of a poor drunkard
I prithee now lead the way without any more talking  Trinculo the king and all our company else being drowned we will inherit here Here bear my bottle Fellow Trinculo we’ll fill him by and by again
A howling monster a drunken monster
O brave monster
Lead the way
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath brown furze anything
Some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone
And most poor matters Point to rich ends
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious but The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead And makes my labors pleasures
Oh she is Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed And he’s composed of harshness
I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up Upon a sore injunction
My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness Had never like executor
I forget But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors Most busiest when I do it
Alas now pray you Work not so hard
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile
Pray set it down and rest you
When this burns 'Twill weep for having wearied you
My father Is hard at study
Pray now rest yourself
He’s safe for these three hours
O most dear mistress The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do
If you’ll sit down I’ll bear your logs the while
Pray give me that
I’ll carry it to the pile
It would become me As well as it does you and I should do it With much more ease for my good will is to it And yours it is against
You look wearily
I do beseech you  Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers  What is your name
Miranda O my father I have broke your hest to say so
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time
For several virtues Have I liked several women
But you O you So perfect and so peerless are created Of every creature’s best
I do not know One of my sex no woman’s face remember  Save from my glass mine own
Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you good friend And my dear father
I am in my condition A prince Miranda I do think a king I would not so and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh fly blow my mouth
Hear my soul speak
The very instant that I saw you did My heart fly to your service there resides To make me slave to it and for your sake Am I this patient log man
Do you love me
O heaven O earth bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true
I Beyond all limit of what else i' th' world Do love prize honor you
I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of
Wherefore weep you
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer What I desire to give and much less take What I shall die to want
But this is trifling And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows
I am your wife if you will marry me
If not I’ll die your maid
To be your fellow You may deny me but I’ll be your servant Whether you will or no
My mistress dearest and I thus humble ever
My husband then
A thousand thousand
I’ll to my book For yet ere supper time must I perform Much business appertaining
Tell not me
When the butt is out we will drink water
Not a drop before
Therefore bear up and board 'em Servant  monster drink to me
Servant monster”
The folly of this island
They say there’s but five upon this isle
We are three of them
If th' other two be brained like us the state totters
Drink servant monster when I bid thee
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head
Where should they be set else
He were a brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail
For my part the sea cannot drown me
He’s no standard
We’ll not run Monsieur Monster
Nor go neither
But you’ll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither
Mooncalf speak once in thy life if thou beest a good mooncalf
How does thy honor
Let me lick thy shoe
Lord” quoth he
That a monster should be such a natural
Trinculo keep a good tongue in your head
If you prove a mutineer the next tree
I thank my noble lord
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee
I will stand and so shall Trinculo
Thou liest
Trinculo if you trouble him any more in ’s tale by this hand I will supplant some of your teeth
Why I said nothing
Mum then and no more
Proceed
I say by sorcery he got this isle
From me he got it
If thy greatness will Revenge it on him for I know thou darest But this thing dare not  That’s most certain
Thou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee
How now shall this be compassed
Canst thou bring me to th' party
Yea yea my lord
I’ll yield him thee asleep Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head
Thou liest
Thou canst not
What a pied ninny’s this Thou scurvy patch  I do beseech thy greatness give him blows And take his bottle from him
When that’s gone He shall drink naught but brine for I’ll not show him Where the quick freshes are
Trinculo run into no further danger
Interrupt the monster one word further and by this hand I’ll turn my mercy out o' doors and make a stockfish of thee
Why what did I
I did nothing
I’ll go farther off
Didst thou not say he lied
Thou liest
I did not give the lie
Out o' your wits and hearing too
A pox o' your bottle
Ha ha ha
Now forward with your tale Prithee stand farther off
Beat him enough
After a little time I’ll beat him too
Why as I told thee ’tis a custom with him I' th' afternoon to sleep
There thou mayst brain him Having first seized his books or with a log Batter his skull or paunch him with a stake Or cut his weasand with thy knife
Remember First to possess his books for without them He’s but a sot as I am nor hath not One spirit to command
They all do hate him As rootedly as I
Burn but his books
He has brave utensils for so he calls them  Which when he has a house he’ll deck withal
And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter
He himself Calls her a nonpareil
I never saw a woman But only Sycorax my dam and she
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great’st does least
Is it so brave a lass
Ay lord
Monster I will kill this man
His daughter and I will be king and queen save our graces and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys Dost thou like the plot Trinculo
Excellent
Give me thy hand
I am sorry I beat thee
But while thou livest keep a good tongue in thy head
Within this half hour will he be asleep
Wilt thou destroy him then
If by your art my dearest father you have Put the wild waters in this roar allay them
The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch But that the sea mounting to th' welkin’s cheek Dashes the fire out
Oh I have suffered With those that I saw suffer
A brave vessel Who had no doubt some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces
Oh the cry did knock Against my very heart
Poor souls they perished
Had I been any god of power I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her
Be collected
No more amazement
Tell your piteous heart There’s no harm done
Oh woe the day
No harm
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts
Ay on mine honor
Thou makest me merry
I am full of pleasure
Let us be jocund
At thy request monster I will do reason any reason  Come on Trinculo let us sing
That’s not the tune
What is this same
O forgive me my sins
Art thou afeard
No monster not I
Be not afeard
This will prove a brave kingdom to me where I shall have my music for nothing
When Prospero is destroyed
That shall be by and by
I remember the story
The sound is going away
Let’s follow it and after do our work
Lead monster we’ll follow
I would I could see this taborer
He lays it on
Wilt come
My old bones ache
Here’s a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders
By your patience I needs must rest me
Old lord I cannot blame thee Who am myself attached with weariness To th' dulling of my spirits
Sit down and rest
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land
Well let him go
What harmony is this
My good friends hark
Marvelous sweet music
Give us kind keepers heavens
What were these
Now I will believe That there are unicorns that in Arabia There is one tree the phoenix' throne one phoenix At this hour reigning there
Travelers ne'er did lie Though fools at home condemn 'em
If in Naples I should report this now would they believe me
If I should say I saw such islanders  For certes these are people of the island  Who though they are of monstrous shape yet note Their manners are more gentle kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many nay almost any
They vanished strangely
No matter since They have left their viands behind for we have stomachs
Will ’t please you taste of what is here
Not I
Faith sir you need not fear
Brother my lord the duke Stand to and do as we
Oh it is monstrous monstrous
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it The winds did sing it to me and the thunder That deep and dreadful organ pipe pronounced The name of Prosper
It did bass my trespass
Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded and I’ll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded
But one fiend at a time I’ll fight their legions o'er
I’ll be thy second
All three of them are desperate
Their great guilt Like poison given to work a great time after Now 'gins to bite the spirits
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to
Follow I pray you
But If thou dost break her virgin knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be ministered No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow but barren hate Sour eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both
Fairly spoke
Sit then and talk with her
She is thine own  What Ariel
My industrious servant Ariel
What would my potent master
Here I am
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform and I must use you In such another trick
Go bring the rabble O'er whom I give thee power here to this place
It is my promise And they expect it from me
Presently
Ay with a twink
Before you can say “Come” and “Go” And breathe twice and cry “So so” Each one tripping on his toe
Tis time I should inform thee farther
Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me
Not yet”      The hour’s now come
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell
I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not Out three years old
Certainly sir I can
By what
By any other house or person
Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance
Dearly my delicate Ariel
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call
Well I conceive
I warrant you sir The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver
Well  Now come my Ariel
Bring a corollary Rather than want a spirit
Appear and pertly  No tongue
All eyes
Be silent
Ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas Of wheat rye barley vetches oats and peas Thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep And flat meads thatched with stover them to keep Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims
Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this short grassed green
A contract of true love to celebrate And some donation freely to estate On the blessed lovers
Tell me heavenly bow If Venus or her son as thou dost know Do now attend the queen
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got Her and her blind boy’s scandaled company I have forsworn
Of her society Be not afraid
I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son Dove drawn with her
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid Whose vows are that no bed right shall be paid Till Hymen’s torch be lighted but in vain
Mars’s hot minion is returned again
Her waspish headed son has broke his arrows Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows And be a boy right out
Highest queen of state Great Juno comes
I know her by her gait
How does my bounteous sister
Go with me To bless this twain that they may prosperous be And honored in their issue
This is a most majestic vision and Harmonious charmingly
May I be bold To think these spirits
Spirits which by mine art I have from their confines called to enact My present fancies
Let me live here ever
So rare a wondered father and a wife Makes this place paradise
Sweet now silence
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously
There’s something else to do
Hush and be mute Or else our spell is marred
Come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate A contract of true love
Be not too late
You sunburnt sicklemen of August weary Come hither from the furrow and be merry
Your rye straw hats put on And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing
The minute of their plot Is almost come Well done
Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger so distempered
We are such stuff As dreams are made on and our little life Is rounded with a sleep
Sir I am vexed
Bear with my weakness
My old brain is troubled
Be not disturbed with my infirmity
If you be pleased retire into my cell And there repose
A turn or two I’ll walk To still my beating mind
We wish your peace
Come with a thought
I thank thee Ariel
Come
Thy thoughts I cleave to
What’s thy pleasure
Spirit We must prepare to meet with Caliban
Ay my commander
When I presented Ceres I thought to have told thee of it but I feared Lest I might anger thee
Say again where didst thou leave these varlets
I told you sir they were red hot with drinking So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces beat the ground For kissing of their feet yet always bending Towards their project
Then I beat my tabor At which like unbacked colts they pricked their ears Advanced their eyelids lifted up their noses As they smelt music
So I charmed their ears That calflike they my lowing followed through Toothed briers sharp furzes pricking gorse and thorns Which entered their frail shins
At last I left them I' th' filthy mantled pool beyond your cell There dancing up to th' chins that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet
This was well done my bird
Thy shape invisible retain thou still
The trumpery in my house go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves
I go I go
A devil a born devil on whose nature Nurture can never stick on whom my pains Humanely taken all all lost quite lost
And as with age his body uglier grows So his mind cankers
I will plague them all Even to roaring
Come hang them on this line
Pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall
We now are near his cell
Monster your fairy which you say is a harmless fairy has done little better than played the jack with us
Monster I do smell all horse piss at which my nose is in great indignation
So is mine Do you hear monster
If I should take a displeasure against you look you Thou wert but a lost monster
Good my lord give me thy favor still
Be patient for the prize I’ll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance
Therefore speak softly
All’s hushed as midnight yet
That’s more to me than my wetting
Yet this is your harmless fairy monster
Prithee my king be quiet
Seest thou here This is the mouth o' th' cell
No noise and enter
Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever and I thy Caliban For aye thy foot licker
Give me thy hand
I do begin to have bloody thoughts
Let it alone thou fool
It is but trash
Oh ho monster we know what belongs to a frippery  Put off that gown Trinculo
By this hand I’ll have that gown
Thy grace shall have it
The dropsy drown this fool
What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage
Let’s alone And do the murder first
If he awake From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches Make us strange stuff
Do do
I thank thee for that jest
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country
There’s another garment for ’t
Monster come put some lime upon your fingers and away with the rest
I will have none on ’t
Monster lay to your fingers
Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom
Go to carry this
And this
Ay and this
Hey Mountain hey
Silver
There it goes Silver
Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me
Thou hadst and more Miranda
But how is it That this lives in thy mind
If thou rememberest aught ere thou camest here How thou camest here thou mayst
But that I do not
Twelve year since Miranda twelve year since Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power
Sir are not you my father
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter
And thy father Was Duke of Milan and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued
Oh the heavens
What foul play had we that we came from thence
Or blessè was ’t we did
Both both my girl
By foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence But blessedly holp hither
Fury Fury There Tyrant there
Hark hark
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions shorten up their sinews With agèd cramps and more pinch spotted make them Than pard or cat o' mountain
Hark they roar
Let them be hunted soundly
At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies
Shortly shall all my labors end and thou Shalt have the air at freedom
For a little Follow and do me service
Now does my project gather to a head
My charms crack not my spirits obey and time Goes upright with his carriage
How’s the day
On the sixth hour at which time my lord You said our work should cease
I did say so When first I raised the tempest
Say my spirit How fares the king and ’s followers
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge Just as you left them all prisoners sir In the line grove which weather fends your cell
They cannot budge till your release
The king His brother and yours abide all three distracted And the remainder mourning over them Brimful of sorrow and dismay
But chiefly Him that you termed sir “the good old Lord Gonzalo” His tears run down his beard like winter’s drops From eaves of reeds
Your charm so strongly works 'em That if you now beheld them your affections Would become tender
Dost thou think so spirit
Mine would sir were I human
And mine shall
The rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance
Go release them Ariel
My charms I’ll break their senses I’ll restore And they shall be themselves
I’ll fetch them sir
With his own bolt     the strong based promontory Have I made shake and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar graves at my command Have waked their sleepers oped and let 'em forth By my so potent art
But this rough magic I here abjure and when I have required Some heavenly music which even now I do To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for I’ll break my staff Bury it certain fathoms in the earth And deeper than did ever plummet sound I’ll drown my book
A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains Now useless boiled within thy skull There stand For you are spell stopped  Mine eyes ev'n sociable to the show of thine Fall fellowly drops
Why that’s my dainty Ariel
I shall miss thee But yet thou shalt have freedom So so so  To the king’s ship invisible as thou art
All torment trouble wonder and amazement Inhabits here
This must crave  An if this be at all a most strange story
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs
But how should Prospero Be living and be here
Whether this be Or be not I’ll not swear
Welcome my friends all
The devil speaks in him
You the like loss
As great to me as late
And supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you for I Have lost my daughter
A daughter
O heavens that they were living both in Naples The king and queen there
That they were I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies When did you lose your daughter
In this last tempest
I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth their words Are natural breath But howsoev'r you have Been justled from your senses know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely Upon this shore where you were wracked was landed To be the lord on ’t
No my dearest love I would not for the world
If this prove A vision of the Island one dear son Shall I twice lose
A most high miracle
Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about
Arise and say how thou camest here
Oh wonder
How many goodly creatures are there here
How beauteous mankind is
O brave new world That has such people in ’t
Tis new to thee
Sir she is mortal
But by immortal providence she’s mine
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice nor thought I had one
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan Of whom so often I have heard renown But never saw before of whom I have Received a second life
And second father This lady makes him to me
I am hers
But oh how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness
There sir stop
Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that’s gone
Oh my heart bleeds To think o' th' teen that I have turned you to Which is from my remembrance
Please you farther
My brother and thy uncle called Antonio  I pray thee mark me (that a brother should Be so perfidious
he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state as at that time Through all the signories it was the first And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed In dignity and for the liberal arts Without a parallel
Those being all my study The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger being transported And rapt in secret studies
Thy false uncle  Dost thou attend me
Sir most heedfully
O good sir I do
Look down you gods And on this couple drop a blessèd crown For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither
I say amen Gonzalo
Was Milan thrust from Milan that his issue Should become kings of Naples
O rejoice Beyond a common joy and set it down With gold on lasting pillars
In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis And Ferdinand her brother found a wife Where he himself was lost Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle and all of us ourselves When no man was his own
Be it so
Amen
Oh look sir look sir
Here is more of us
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company
The next our ship  Which but three glasses since we gave out split  Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea
These are not natural events
On a trice so please you Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of
Some oracle Must rectify our knowledge
Sir my liege Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business
How fares my gracious sir
Coraggio bully monsterIf these be true spies which I wear in my head here’s a goodly sight
O Setebos these be brave spirits indeed
How fine my master is
I am afraid He will chastise me
Ha ha
What things are these my lord Antonio
Will money buy 'em
I shall be pinched to death
Is not this Stephano my drunken butler
He is drunk now
Where had he wine
And Trinculo is reeling ripe
Why how now Stephano
O touch me not
I am not Stephano but a cramp
You’d be king o' th' isle sirrah
I should have been a sore one then
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape  Take with you your companions
And I’ll be wise hereafter And seek for grace
What a thrice double ass Was I to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool
Go to away
Or stole it rather
And in the morn I’ll bring you to your ship and so to Naples Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear belovèd solemnized And thence retire me to my Milan where Every third thought shall be my grave
I long To hear the story of your life which must Take the ear strangely
Now my charms are all o'erthrown And what strength I have’s mine own Which is most faint
Let me not Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver dwell In this bare island by your spell But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands
As you from crimes would pardoned be Let your indulgence set me free
I pray thee mark me
I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which but by being so retired O'erprized all popular rate in my false brother Awaked an evil nature
And my trust Like a good parent did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was which had indeed no limit A confidence sans bound
Hence his ambition growing  Dost thou hear
Your tale sir would cure deafness
Me poor man my library Was dukedom large enough
Oh the heavens
Mark his condition and the event
Then tell me If this might be a brother
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother
The King of Naples being an enemy To me inveterate hearkens my brother’s suit Which was that he in lieu o' th' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother
Alack for pity
I not remembering how I cried out then Will cry it o'er again
It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to ’t
Hear a little further And then I’ll bring thee to the present business Which now ’s upon ’s without the which this story Were most impertinent
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us
Well demanded wench
My tale provokes that question
Dear they durst not So dear the love my people bore me nor set A mark so bloody on the business but With colors fairer painted their foul ends
Alack what trouble Was I then to you
Oh a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me
Thou didst smile Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven When I have decked the sea with drops full salt Under my burthen groaned which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue
How came we ashore
By providence divine
Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo Out of his charity who being then appointed Master of this design did give us with Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries Which since have steaded much
So of his gentleness Knowing I loved my books he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom
Would I might But ever see that man
Now I arise
Heavens thank you for ’t
And now I pray you sir  For still ’tis beating in my mind your reason For raising this sea storm
Know thus far forth By accident most strange bountiful Fortune (Now my dear lady) hath mine enemies Brought to this shore
Here cease more questions
Tis a good dullness And give it way
I know thou canst not choose
Come away servant come
I am ready now
Approach my Ariel come
All hail great master
Grave sir hail
Hast thou spirit Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee
Sometime I’d divide And burn in many places
Jove’s lightning the precursors O' th' dreadful thunderclaps more momentary And sight outrunning were not
My brave spirit
Boatswain
Here master
What cheer
Good speak to th' mariners
Fall to ’t yarely or we run ourselves aground
Where’s the Master
Play the men
I pray now keep below
Where is the Master Boatswain
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel Then all afire with me
The king’s son Ferdinand With hair up staring then like reeds not hair  Was the first man that leaped cried “Hell is empty And all the devils are here”      Why that’s my spirit
But was not this nigh shore
Close by my master
But are they Ariel safe
Not a hair perished
On their sustaining garments not a blemish But fresher than before
And as thou badest me In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle
The king’s son have I landed by himself Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting His arms in this sad knot
Of the king’s ship The mariners say how thou hast disposed And all the rest o' th' fleet
The mariners all under hatches stowed Who with a charm joined to their suffered labor I have left asleep
And for the rest o' th' fleet Which I dispersed they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float Bound sadly home for Naples Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wracked And his great person perish
Ariel thy charge Exactly is performed
But there’s more work
What is the time o' th' day
Past the mid season
At least two glasses
The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously
Is there more toil
Since thou dost give me pains Let me remember thee what thou hast promised Which is not yet performed me
How now
Moody
What is ’t thou canst demand
My liberty
Before the time be out
No more
I prithee Remember I have done thee worthy service Told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served Without or grudge or grumblings
Thou didst promise To bate me a full year
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee
No
Thou dost and think’st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep To run upon the sharp wind of the north To do me business in the veins o' th' earth When it is baked with frost
I do not sir
Thou liest malignant thing
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop
Hast thou forgot her
No sir
Thou hast
Where was she born
Speak
Tell me
Sir in Argier
Oh was she so
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been Which thou forget’st
This damned witch Sycorax For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing from Argier Thou know’st was banished
For one thing she did They would not take her life
Is not this true
Ay sir
This blue eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th' sailors
Thou my slave As thou report’st thyself wast then her servant
And for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands Refusing her grand hests she did confine thee By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage Into a cloven pine within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years within which space she died And left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike
Dull thing I say so
He that Caliban Whom now I keep in service
It was mine art When I arrived and heard thee that made gape The pine and let thee out
I thank thee master
If thou more murmur’st I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters
Pardon master
I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently
Do so and after two days I will discharge thee
That’s my noble master
What shall I do
Say what
What shall I do
Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea
Be subject To no sight but thine and mine invisible To every eyeball else
Go take this shape And hither come in ’t
Go hence with diligence
Shake it off
Come on
We’ll visit Caliban my slave who never Yields us kind answer
But as ’tis We cannot miss him
He does make our fire Fetch in our wood and serves in offices That profit us What ho
Slave
Caliban
Speak
Come forth I say
There’s other business for thee
Come thou tortoise
Fine apparition
My quaint Ariel Hark in thine ear
My lord it shall be done
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both
A southwest blow on ye And blister you all o'er
For this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps Side stitches that shall pen thy breath up
Urchins Shall forth at vast of night that they may work All exercise on thee
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em
I must eat my dinner
This island’s mine by Sycorax my mother Which thou takest from me
Cursed be I that did so
Thou most lying slave Whom stripes may move not kindness
I have used thee Filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate The honor of my child
Oh ho oh ho
Would ’t had been done
Thou didst prevent me
Abhorrèd slave Which any print of goodness wilt not take Being capable of all ill
I pitied thee Took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour One thing or other
But thy vile race Though thou didst learn had that in ’t which good natures Could not abide to be with
Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock Who hadst deserved more than a prison
You taught me language and my profit on ’t Is I know how to curse
The red plague rid you For learning me your language
No pray thee
So slave hence
The watchdogs bark
Hark hark
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry “Cock a diddle dow” Where should this music be
I' th' air or th' earth
It sounds no more and sure it waits upon Some god o' th' island
Sitting on a bank Weeping again the king my father’s wrack This music crept by me upon the waters Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air
Thence I have followed it Or it hath drawn me rather
But ’tis gone
No it begins again
Hark now I hear them
The ditty does remember my drowned father
I hear it now above me
What is ’t
A spirit
Lord how it looks about
Believe me sir It carries a brave form
But ’tis a spirit
No wench
It eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have such
He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em
Do you not hear him
You mar our labor
Keep your cabins
You do assist the storm
Nay good be patient
Hence
To cabin silence
Trouble us not
Good yet remember whom thou hast aboard
None that I more love than myself
You are a councilor
Use your authority
If you cannot give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour if it so hap Cheerly good hearts Out of our way I say
I have great comfort from this fellow
I might call him A thing divine for nothing natural I ever saw so noble
No wonder sir But certainly a maid
My language
Heavens I am the best of them that speak this speech Were I but where ’tis spoken
How
The best
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee
A single thing as I am now that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples
He does hear me And that he does I weep
Myself am Naples Who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld The king my father wracked
Alack for mercy
Yes faith and all his lords the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain
Soft sir
One word more
If the ill spirit have so fair a house Good things will strive to dwell with ’t
What I say
Come from thy ward For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop
Beseech you father
Hence
Hang not on my garments
Sir have pity I’ll be his surety
Silence
One word more Shall make me chide thee if not hate thee
What An advocate for an imposter
Hush Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he Having seen but him and Caliban
Foolish wench To th' most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels
My affections Are then most humble
I have no ambition To see a goodlier man
So they are
My spirits as in a dream are all bound up
My father’s loss the weakness which I feel The wrack of all my friends nor this man’s threats To whom I am subdued are but light to me Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid
Space enough Have I in such a prison
Prithee peace
A dollar
Dolor comes to him indeed
You have spoken truer than you purposed
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should
Well I have done
But yet  Which of he or Adrian for a good wager first begins to crow
The old cock
The cockerel
Done
The wager
A laughter
A match
Though this island seem to be desert 
It must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance
Temperance was a delicate wench
Ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly
Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen
Here is everything advantageous to life
True
Save means to live
Of that there’s none or little
How lush and lusty the grass looks
How green
The ground indeed is tawny
With an eye of green in ’t
He misses not much
No he doth but mistake the truth totally
But the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond credit As many vouched rarities are
That our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new dyed than stained with salt water
Ay or very falsely pocket up his report
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric at the marriage of the king’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis
Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen
Widow Dido” said you
You make me study of that
She was of Carthage not of Tunis
Carthage
I assure you Carthage
His word is more than the miraculous harp
What impossible matter will he make easy next
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands
Ay
Why in good time
Down with the topmast
Yare lower lower
Bring her to try wi' th' main course
A plague upon this howling
They are louder than the weather or our office
Yet again
What do you here
Shall we give o'er and drown
Have you a mind to sink
I’ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench
Lay her a hold a hold
All lost
To prayers to prayers all lost
And the rarest that e'er came there
Bate I beseech you widow Dido
Oh widow Dido
Ay widow Dido
Is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it
I mean in a sort
That “sort” was well fished for
When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense
Sir he may live
I not doubt He came alive to land
No no he’s gone
Prithee peace
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience at Which end o' th' beam should bow
We have lost your son I fear forever
Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business' making Than we bring men to comfort them
The fault’s your own
So is the dearest o' th' loss
My lord Sebastian The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster
Very well
And most chirurgeonly
Foul weather
Very foul
Had I plantation of this isle my lord  He’d sow ’t with nettle seed
Or docks or mallows
And were the king on ’t what would I do
Scape being drunk for want of wine
For no kind of traffic Would I admit
No occupation
No sovereignty      Yet he would be king on ’t
All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavor
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison all abundance To feed my innocent people
No marrying ’mong his subjects
None man
Prithee no more
Thou dost talk nothing to me
Twas you we laughed at
What a blow was there given
An it had not fallen flat long
You are gentlemen of brave mettle
You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing
We would so and then go a batfowling
No I warrant you
Go sleep and hear us
What all so soon asleep
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts
Please you sir Do not omit the heavy offer of it
It seldom visits sorrow
We two my lord Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety
Thank you
Wondrous heavy
What a strange drowsiness possesses them
It is the quality o' th' climate
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink
I find not Myself disposed to sleep
Nor I
My spirits are nimble
They fell together all as by consent
Th' occasion speaks thee and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head
What art thou waking
Do you not hear me speak
I do and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak’st Out of thy sleep
What is it thou didst say
Thou dost snore distinctly
There’s meaning in thy snores
I’ll teach you how to flow
Do so
Oh If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it
How in stripping it You more invest it
Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth
Prithee say on
I have no hope That he’s undrowned
Oh out of that “no hope” What great hope have you
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond But doubt discovery there
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned
He’s gone
Then tell me Who’s the next heir of Naples
Claribel
Tis true my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis So is she heir of Naples ’twixt which regions There is some space
I myself could make A chough of as deep chat
Oh that you bore The mind that I do what a sleep were this For your advancement
Methinks I do
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune
I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero
My brother’s servants Were then my fellows
Now they are my men
But for your conscience
Ay sir
But I feel not This deity in my bosom
Should not upbraid our course
For all the rest They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk
They’ll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour
Thy case dear friend Shall be my precedent
As thou got’st Milan I’ll come by Naples
Draw thy sword
One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest
And I the king shall love thee
Draw together
And when I rear my hand do you the like To fall it on Gonzalo
O but one word
What must our mouths be cold
The king and prince at prayers
I’m out of patience
He’ll be hanged yet though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him
Let’s all sink wi' th' king
Let’s take leave of him
Then let us both be sudden
Why are you drawn
Wherefore this ghastly looking
What’s the matter
Whiles we stood here securing your repose Even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls or rather lions
Did ’t not wake you
It struck mine ear most terribly
I heard nothing
Oh ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear To make an earthquake
Sure it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions
Heard you this Gonzalo
Upon mine honor sir I heard a humming And that a strange one too which did awake me
I shaked you sir and cried
As mine eyes opened I saw their weapons drawn
There was a noise That’s verily
Let’s draw our weapons
Heavens keep him from these beasts
For he is sure i' th' island
Lead away
His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse
But they’ll nor pinch Fright me with urchin shows pitch me i' th' mire Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way unless he bid 'em
Sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness
Lo now lo
Perchance he will not mind me
Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all
And another storm brewing I hear it sing i' th' wind
Yond same black cloud yond huge one looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor
A strange fish
Were I in England now as once I was and had but this fish painted not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver
There would this monster make a man
Any strange beast there makes a man
When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian
Legged like a man and his fins like arms
Warm o' my troth
I do now let loose my opinion hold it no longer this is no fish but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt
Alas the storm is come again
My best way is to creep under his gaberdine
There is no other shelter hereabouts
Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral
Well here’s my comfort
Do not torment me
Oh
What’s the matter
Have we devils here
Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind ha
I have not ’scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs
The spirit torments me
Oh
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got as I take it an ague
Where the devil should he learn our language
I will give him some relief if it be but for that
If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather
Do not torment me prithee
I’ll bring my wood home faster
He’s in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest
He shall taste of my bottle
If he have never drunk wine afore it will go near to remove his fit
If I can recover him and keep him tame I will not take too much for him
He shall pay for him that hath him and that soundly
Lie thou there (throwing down a letter) for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling
Maria once told me she did affect me and I have heard herself come thus near that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion
Besides she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her
What should I think on ’t
To be Count Malvolio
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe
Seven of my people with an obedient start make out for him
I frown the while and perchance wind up watch or play with my some rich jewel
Lips do not move No man must know”
No man must know” What follows
No man must know” If this should be thee Malvolio
I may command where I adore But silence like a Lucrece knife With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore MOAI
doth sway my life” Nay but first let me see let me see let me see
I may command where I adore” Why she may command me
Why this is evident to any formal capacity
There is no obstruction in this
If I could make that resemble something in me Softly
There is a fair behavior in thee captain And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character
I prithee and I’ll pay thee bounteously  Conceal me what I am and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent
I’ll serve this duke
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him
It may be worth thy pains for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service
Be you his eunuch and your mute I’ll be
When my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see
I thank thee
Lead me on
M” Malvolio
M” why that begins my name
MOAI” This simulation is not as the former and yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for every one of these letters are in my name
Soft here follows prose
If this fall into thy hand revolve
In my stars I am above thee but be not afraid of greatness
Some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon 'em
Thy Fates open their hands
Let thy blood and spirit embrace them
And to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy humble slough and appear fresh
I say remember
Farewell
She that would alter services with theeThe Fortunate Unhappy”Daylight and champaign discovers not more
This is open
I will be proud I will read politic authors I will baffle Sir Toby I will wash off gross acquaintance I will be point  devise the very man
I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason excites to this that my lady loves me
She did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being cross gartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking
I thank my stars I am happy
I will be strange stout in yellow stockings and cross gartered even with the swiftness of putting on
Jove and my stars be praised
Here is yet a postscript
Thou canst not choose but know who I am
If thou entertainest my love let it appear in thy smiling
Thy smiles become thee well
Therefore in my presence still smile dear my sweet I prithee”
Jove I thank thee
I will do everything that thou wilt have me
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy
I could marry this wench for this device
So could I too
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest
Nor I neither
Here comes my noble gull catcher
Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck
Or o' mine either
Shall I play my freedom at tray trip and become thy bondslave
I' faith or I either
Why thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad
Nay but say true does it work upon him
Like aqua vitae with a midwife
If you will see it follow me
To the gates of Tartar thou most excellent devil of wit
I’ll make one too
Save thee friend and thy music
Dost thou live by thy tabour
No sir I live by the church
Art thou a churchman
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor stand by the church
You have said sir
How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward
Nay that’s certain
I would therefore my sister had no name sir
Why man
Why sir her name’s a word and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton
Thy reason man
Troth sir I can yield you none without words and words are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with them
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing
Not so sir I do care for something
But in my conscience sir I do not care for you
If that be to care for nothing sir I would it would make you invisible
Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool
No indeed sir the Lady Olivia has no folly
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s
It shines everywhere
I would be sorry sir but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress I think I saw your wisdom there
Hold there’s expenses for thee
Now Jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard
to fool) Is thy lady within
Yes being kept together and put to use
My lady is within sir
I will construe to them whence you come
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin I might say “element” but the word is overworn
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool And to do that well craves a kind of wit
This is a practise As full of labor as a wise man’s art For folly that he wisely shows is fit
Save you gentleman
And you sir
I am bound to your niece sir
I mean she is the list of my voyage
Taste your legs sir
Put them to motion
I mean to go sir to enter
I will answer you with gait and entrance
But we are prevented
Most excellent accomplished lady the heavens rain odors on you
My matter hath no voice lady but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear
em all three all ready
Let the garden door be shut and leave me to my hearing
Give me your hand sir
My duty madam and most humble service
What is your name
Cesario is your servant’s name fair princess
My servant sir
Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call’d compliment
For him I think not on him
For his thoughts Would they were blanks rather than fill’d with me
Madam I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf
O by your leave I pray you I bade you never speak again of him
Dear lady  Give me leave beseech you
I did send After the last enchantment you did here A ring in chase of you
What might you think
What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus
By my troth Sir Toby you must come in earlier o' nights
Your cousin my lady takes great exceptions to your ill hours
Why let her except before excepted
I’ll confine myself no finer than I am
These clothes are good enough to drink in and so be these boots too
An they be not let them hang themselves in their own straps
Who Sir Andrew Aguecheek
Ay he
He’s as tall a man as any ’s in Illyria
Have you not set mine honor at the stake And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think
To one of your receiving Enough is shown
So let me hear you speak
I pity you
That’s a degree to love
No not a grize
If one should be a prey how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf
There lies your way due west
Stay I prithee tell me what thou thinkest of me
That you do think you are not what you are
If I think so I think the same of you
I would you were as I would have you be
Would it be better madam than I am
I wish it might for now I am your fool
And so adieu good madam
No faith I’ll not stay a jot longer
Thy reason dear venom give thy reason
You must needs yield your reason Sir Andrew
Marry I saw your niece do more favors to the Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me
I saw ’t i' the orchard
Did she see thee the while old boy
Tell me that
As plain as I see you now
This was a great argument of love in her toward you
Slight will you make an ass o' me
I will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reason
And they have been grand jurymen since before Noah was a sailor
She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valor to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver
You should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests fire new from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness
This was looked for at your hand and this was balked
An ’t be any way it must be with valor for policy I hate
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician
Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor
Challenge me the count’s youth to fight with him
Hurt him in eleven places
My niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no love broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor
There is no way but this Sir Andrew
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him
Go write it in a martial hand
Be curst and brief
It is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention
Go
This is a dear manikin to you Sir Toby
I have been dear to him lad some two thousand strong or so
We shall have a rare letter from him but you’ll not deliver ’t
Never trust me then
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer
I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together
Look where the youngest wren of nine comes
If you desire the spleen and will laugh yourself into stitches follow me
He’s in yellow stockings
And cross gartered
Most villanously like a pedant that keeps a school i' the church
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies
You have not seen such a thing as ’tis
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him
I know my lady will strike him
If she do he’ll smile and take ’t for a great favor
Come bring us bring us where he is
I could not stay behind you
My kind Antonio I can no other answer make but thanks And thanks and ever thanks
What’s to do
Shall we go see the relics of this town
Belike you slew great number of his people
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them which for traffic’s sake Most of our city did
Only myself stood out For which if I be lapsèd in this place I shall pay dear
Do not then walk too open
It doth not fit me
Hold sir here’s my purse
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase and your store I think is not for idle markets sir
I’ll be your purse bearer and leave you For an hour
To the Elephant
I do remember
I have sent after him
He says he’ll come
For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrow’d
I speak too loud  Where’s Malvolio
He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes
Where is Malvolio
He’s coming madam but in very strange manner
He is sure possessed madam
Why what’s the matter
Does he rave
No madam he does nothing but smile
Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits
Go call him hither
I am as mad as he If sad and merry madness equal be
How now Malvolio
Sweet lady ho ho
Why he has three thousand ducats a year
He’s a very fool and a prodigal
Fie that you’ll say so
By this hand they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him
Who are they
They that add moreover he’s drunk nightly in your company
With drinking healths to my niece
I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria
He’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish top
Sir Toby Belch
How now Sir Toby Belch
Sweet Sir Andrew
Smilest thou
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion
Sad lady
I could be sad
This does make some obstruction in the blood this cross gartering but what of that
If it please the eye of one it is with me as the very true sonnet is “Please one and please all”Why how dost thou man
What is the matter with thee
Not black in my mind though yellow in my legs
It did come to his hands and commands shall be executed
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand
Wilt thou go to bed Malvolio
To bed
How do you Malvolio
At your request
Yes nightingales answer daws
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady
Be not afraid of greatness” 'Twas well writ
What meanest thou by that Malvolio
Some are born great ”
Ha
Some achieve greatness ” What sayest thou
And some have greatness thrust upon them” Heaven restore thee
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings ” Thy yellow stockings
And wished to see thee cross gartered” Cross gartered
Go to thou art made if thou desirest to be so ” Am I made
Madam the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned
I’ll come to him
Good Maria let this fellow be looked to
Where’s my cousin Toby
Let some of my people have a special care of him
I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry
Oh ho
Do you come near me now
This concurs directly with the letter
Cast thy humble slough” says she
I have limed her but it is Jove’s doing and Jove make me thankful
And when she went away now “Let this fellow be looked to” “Fellow” Not “Malvolio” nor after my degree but “fellow” Why everything adheres together that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous or unsafe circumstance what can be said
Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes
Well Jove not I is the doer of this and he is to be thanked
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little and Legion himself possessed him yet I’ll speak to him
Here he is here he is
How is’t with you sir
Go off I discard you
Let me enjoy my private
Go off
Aha
Does she so
Do you know what you say
Marry and it shall be done tomorrow morning if I live
My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say
How now mistress
O Lord
No way but gentleness gently gently
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used
Sir
Ay Biddy come with me What man
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry pit with Satan
Hang him foul collier
Get him to say his prayers good Sir Toby get him to pray
My prayers minx
Go hang yourselves all
You are idle shallow things
I am not of your element
You shall know more hereafter
Is ’t possible
If this were played upon a stage now I could condemn it as an improbable fiction
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device man
Nay pursue him now lest the device take air and taint
Why we shall make him mad indeed
The house will be the quieter
Come we’ll have him in a dark room and bound
My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad
More matter for a May morning
Is ’t so saucy
Ay is ’t I warrant him
Do but read
Give me
A good note that keeps you from the blow of the law
Very brief and to exceeding good sense less
Good
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law
Good
Andrew Aguecheek”
If this letter move him not his legs cannot
I’ll give ’t him
You may have very fit occasion for ’t
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart
Go Sir Andrew
Scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum baily
Away
Nay let me alone for swearing
His employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less
Therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth
He will find it comes from a clodpole
But sir I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatrices
Here he comes with your niece
Give them way till he take leave and presently after him
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge
With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master’s grief
Here wear this jewel for me
Tis my picture
Refuse it not
It hath no tongue to vex you
And I beseech you come again tomorrow
What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny That honor saved may upon asking give
Nothing but this your true love for my master
How with mine honor may I give him that Which I have given to you
I will acquit you
Well come again tomorrow
Fare thee well
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell
Gentleman God save thee
And you sir
That defense thou hast betake thee to ’t
Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him I know not but thy intercepter full of despite bloody as the hunter attends thee at the orchard end
Dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for thy assailant is quick skillful and deadly
You mistake sir
I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man
You’ll find it otherwise I assure you
I pray you sir what is he
He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl
Souls and bodies hath he divorced three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre
Hob nob is his word
And you too sir
Accost Sir Andrew accost
What’s that
Good Mistress Accost I desire better acquaintance
My name is Mary sir
By my troth I would not undertake her in this company
Is that the meaning of “accost”
An thou let part so Sir Andrew would thou mightst never draw sword again
An you part so mistress I would I might never draw sword again
Fair lady do you think you have fools in hand
Sir I have not you by the hand
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady
I am no fighter
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valor
Belike this is a man of that quirk
Sir no
His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury
Therefore get you on and give him his desire
Back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him
This is as uncivil as strange
I beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offense to him is
It is something of my negligence nothing of my purpose
I will do so
Signior Fabian stay you by this gentleman till my return
Pray you sir do you know of this matter
I beseech you what manner of man is he
He is indeed sir the most skillful bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria
Will you walk towards him
I will make your peace with him if I can
I shall be much bound to you for ’t
Why man he’s a very devil
I have not seen such a firago
I had a pass with him rapier scabbard and all and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable
And on the answer he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy
Pox on ’t
I’ll not meddle with him
Ay but he will not now be pacified
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder
Plague on ’t an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence I’d have seen him damned ere I’d have challenged him
Let him let the matter slip and I’ll give him my horse gray Capilet
I’ll make the motion
Stand here make a good show on ’t
This shall end without the perdition of souls
I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you
He is as horribly conceited of him and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his heels
Come Sir Andrew there’s no remedy
The gentleman will for his honor’s sake have one bout with you
He cannot by the duello avoid it
But he has promised me as he is a gentleman and a soldier he will not hurt you
Come on to ’t
Pray God he keep his oath
I do assure you ’tis against my will
Put up your sword
If this young gentleman Have done offence I take the fault on me
If you offend him I for him defy you
You sir
Why what are you
One sir that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will
Nay if you be an undertaker I am for you
O good Sir Toby hold
Here come the officers
Marry will I sir
And for that I promised you I’ll be as good as my word
He will bear you easily and reins well
This is the man
Do thy office
Antonio I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino
You do mistake me sir
No sir no jot
I know your favor well Though now you have no sea cap on your head  Take him away
He knows I know him well
I must obey
You stand amazed But be of comfort
Come sir away
What money sir
I’ll make division of my present with you
Hold there’s half my coffer
Will you deny me now
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying vainness babbling drunkenness Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood     O heavens themselves
Come sir I pray you go
Let me speak a little
Away
But oh how vile an idol proves this god
None can be called deformed but the unkind
Virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourished by the devil
The man grows mad
Away with him
Lead me on
Methinks his words do from such passion fly That he believes himself
So do not I
Prove true imagination oh prove true That I dear brother be now ta'en for you
Come hither knight
Come hither Fabian
We’ll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws
He named Sebastian
Still in this fashion color ornament For him I imitate
Oh if it prove Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love
A very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward than a hare
His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him
And for his cowardship ask Fabian
A coward a most devout coward religious in it
Slid I’ll after him again and beat him
An I do not  Come let’s see the event
I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet
Let me be clear of thee
Well held out i' faith
No I do not know you nor I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her nor your name is not Master Cesario nor this is not my nose neither
Nothing that is so is so
I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else
Thou know’st not me
Vent my folly
He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool
Vent my folly
I am afraid this great lubber the world will prove a cockney
I prithee now ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady
Shall I vent to her that thou art coming
I prithee foolish Greek depart from me
There’s money for thee
By my troth thou hast an open hand
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report after fourteen years' purchase
Hold sir or I’ll throw your dagger o'er the house
Nay let him alone
I’ll go another way to work with him
I’ll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria
Though I struck him first yet it’s no matter for that
Come sir I will not let you go
Come my young soldier put up your iron
You are well fleshed
Come on
I will be free from thee
What wouldst thou now
If thou darest tempt me further draw thy sword
What what
Nay then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you
Hold Toby
On thy life I charge thee hold
Madam
Will it be ever thus
Out of my sight  Be not offended dear Cesario  Rudesby be gone
Thou shalt not choose but go
Do not deny
Beshrew his soul for me
He started one poor heart of mine in thee
Wherefore sweetheart
Why I think so
I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry
But what’s your jest
A dry jest sir
Are you full of them
Marry now I let go your hand I am barren
O knight thou lackest a cup of canary
When did I see thee so put down
Never in your life I think unless you see canary put me down
Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has
If it be thus to dream still let me sleep
Nay come I prithee
Would thou’dst be ruled by me
Madam I will
Oh say so and so be
Nay I prithee put on this gown and this beard
Make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate
Do it quickly
I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst
The competitors enter
Jove bless thee master Parson
Bonos dies Sir Toby
To him Sir Topas
The knave counterfeits well
A good knave
Sir Topas Sir Topas good Sir Topas go to my lady  Out hyperbolical fiend
How vexest thou this man
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies
Fie thou dishonest Satan
I call thee by the most modest terms for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy
Sayest thou that house is dark
As hell Sir Topas
Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes and the clerestories toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony
And yet complainest thou of obstruction
I am not mad Sir Topas
I say to you this house is dark
Madman thou errest
I say there is no darkness but ignorance in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog
I say this house is as dark as ignorance though ignorance were as dark as hell
I am no more mad than you are
Make the trial of it in any constant question
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird
What thinkest thou of his opinion
I think nobly of the soul and no way approve his opinion
Fare thee well
Remain thou still in darkness
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam
Fare thee well
Sir Topas Sir Topas
My most exquisite Sir Topas
Nay I am for all waters
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown
He sees thee not
To him in thine own voice and bring me word how thou findest him
I would we were well rid of this knavery
If he may be conveniently delivered I would he were for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot
Come by and by to my chamber
Fool
Fool
Fool I say
Good fool as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand help me to a candle and pen ink and paper
As I am a gentleman I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t
Master Malvolio
Ay good fool
But as well
Then you are mad indeed if you be no better in your wits than a fool
Sir Topas
Fool fool fool I say
Alas sir be patient
What say you sir
Good fool help me to some light and some paper
I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria
Well a day that you were sir
By this hand I am
Good fool some ink paper and light and convey what I will set down to my lady
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did
I will help you to ’t
But tell me true are you not mad indeed
Or do you but counterfeit
Believe me I am not
I tell thee true
Nay I’ll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains
I will fetch you light and paper and ink
Fool I’ll requite it in the highest degree
I prithee be gone
This is the air that is the glorious sun
Where’s Antonio then
I could not find him at the Elephant
Yet there he was and there I found this credit That he did range the town to seek me out
His counsel now might do me golden service
There’s something in ’t That is deceivable
But here the lady comes
I’ll follow this good man and go with you And having sworn truth ever will be true
Then lead the way good father and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine
Now as thou lovest me let me see his letter
Good Master Fabian grant me another request
Anything
Do not desire to see this letter
Belong you to the Lady Olivia friends
Ay sir we are some of her trappings
I know thee well
How dost thou my good fellow
Truly sir the better for my foes and the worse for my friends
The better for thy friends
No sir the worse
How can that be
I’ll ride home tomorrow Sir Toby
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair
Why would that have mended my hair
Past question for thou seest it will not curl by nature
But it becomes me well enough does ’t not
Excellent
It hangs like flax on a distaff
Faith I’ll home tomorrow Sir Toby
The count himself here hard by woos her
I have heard her swear ’t
Tut there’s life in ’t man
Marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass
So that by my foes sir I profit in the knowledge of myself and by my friends I am abused
So that conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives make your two affirmatives why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes
Why this is excellent
By my troth sir no though it please you to be one of my friends
Thou shalt not be the worse for me there’s gold
But that it would be double dealing sir I would you could make it another
O you give me ill counsel
Well I will be so much a sinner to be a double dealer
There’s another
Primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old saying is the third pays for all
The triplex sir is a good tripping measure or the bells of Saint Bennet sir may put you in mind one two three
You can fool no more money out of me at this throw
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her and bring her along with you it may awake my bounty further
Marry sir lullaby to your bounty till I come again
I go sir but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness
But as you say sir let your bounty take a nap I will awake it anon
Here comes the man sir that did rescue me
That face of his I do remember well
Yet when I saw it last it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war
A baubling vessel was he captain of For shallow draught and bulk unprizable With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him What’s the matter
Orsino this is that Antonio That took theAnd this is he that did theWhen your young nephew Titus lost his leg
He did me kindness sir drew on my side But in conclusion put strange speech upon me
I know not what ’twas but distraction
Notable pirate
Orsino noble sir Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate Though I confess on base and ground enough Orsino’s enemy
That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem
A wreck past hope he was
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love without retention or restraint All his in dedication
How can this be
Here comes the Countess
Now heaven walks on earth
What would my lord but that he may not have Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable
Cesario you do not keep promise with me
Madam
Gracious Olivia  What do you say Cesario Good my lord  My lord would speak
My duty hushes me
Still so cruel
Still so constant lord
What to perverseness
You uncivil lady To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull’st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered what shall I do
Even what it please my lord that shall become him
Come boy with me
And I most jocund apt and willingly To do you rest a thousand deaths would die
Where goes Cesario
Ay me detested
Who does beguile you
Who does do you wrong
Hast thou forgot thyself
Is it so long  Call forth the holy father
Come away
Whither my lord Cesario husband stay
Husband
Ay husband
Can he that deny
Her husband sirrah
No my lord not I Alas it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety
Fear not Cesario
Be that thou know’st thou art and then thou art As great as that thou fear’st
O welcome father
Father I charge thee by thy reverence Here to unfold (though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me
My lord I do protest     O do not swear
Hold little faith though thou hast too much fear
For the love of God a surgeon
Send one presently to Sir Toby
What’s the matter
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too
For the love of God your help
I had rather than forty pound I were at home
Who has done this Sir Andrew
The Count’s gentleman one Cesario
We took him for a coward but he’s the very devil incardinate
My gentleman Cesario
Od’s lifelings here he is You broke my head for nothing and that that I did I was set on to do ’t by Sir Toby
Why do you speak to me
I never hurt you
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt you have hurt me
I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb
Here comes Sir Toby halting
You shall hear more
But if he had not been in drink he would have tickled you othergates than he did
How now gentleman
How is ’t with you
That’s all one has hurt me and there’s the end on ’t
FOOL Oh he’s drunk Sir Toby an hour agone
His eyes were set at eight i' the morning
Then he’s a rogue and a passy measures pavin
I hate a drunken rogue
Away with him
Who hath made this havoc with them
I’ll help you Sir Toby because we’ll be dressed together
Will you help An ass head and a coxcomb and a knave a thin faced knave a gull
Get him to bed and let his hurt be looked to
Pardon me sweet one even for the vows We made each other but so late ago
One face one voice one habit and two persons
Antonio O my dear Antonio
How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee
Sebastian are you
Fear’st thou that Antonio
How have you made division of yourself
An apple cleft in two is not more twin Than these two creatures
Which is Sebastian
Most wonderful
Sebastian was my father Such a Sebastian was my brother too So went he suited to his watery tomb
A spirit I am indeed But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate
Were you a woman as the rest goes even I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say “Thrice welcome drownèd Viola” My father had a mole upon his brow
And so had mine
And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years
I’ll stay a month longer
I am a fellow o' th' strangest mind i' th' world
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether
Art thou good at these kickshawses knight
Wherefore are these things hid
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em
Are they like to take dust like Mistress Mall’s picture
Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto
I would not so much as make water but in a sink a pace
What dost thou mean
Is it a world to hide virtues in
I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg it was formed under the star of a galliard
Ay ’tis strong and it does indifferent well in a dun colored stock
What shall we do else
Were we not born under Taurus
Oh that record is lively in my soul
He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years
Give me thy hand And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds
The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid’s garments
He upon some action Is now in durance at Malvolio’s suit A gentleman and follower of my lady’s
He shall enlarge him
A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his
Truly madam he holds Beelzebub at the staves' end as well as a man in his case may do
Has here writ a letter to you
I should have given ’t you today morning but as a madman’s epistles are no gospels so it skills not much when they are delivered
Open ’t and read it
Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman
How now
Art thou mad
No madam I do but read madness
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be you must allowPrithee read i' thy right wits
So I do madonna
But to read his right wits is to read thus
Therefore perpend my princess and give ear
By the Lord madam you wrong me and the world shall know it
Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship
Think of me as you please
I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury
The madly used Malvolio”Did he write this
Ay madam
This savors not much of distraction
See him delivered Fabian bring him hither
Madam I am most apt to embrace your offer
Is this the madman
Ay my lord this same
How now Malvolio
Madam you have done me wrong Notorious wrong
Have I Malvolio
No
Tell me why
Alas Malvolio this is not my writing Though I confess much like the character
But out of question ’tis Maria’s hand
And now I do bethink me it was she First told me thou wast mad then camest in smiling And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter
Prithee be content
Why “some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrown upon them” I was one sir in this interlude one Sir Topas sir but that’s all one
He hath been most notoriously abused
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace
He hath not told us of the captain yet
Cesario come For so you shall be while you are a man
Taurus
That’s sides and heart
No sir it is legs and thighs
Let me see the caper
He hath known you but three days and already you are no stranger
No believe me
I thank you
Here comes the count
Who saw Cesario ho
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds Rather than make unprofited return
I think not so my lord
Dear lad believe it
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man
I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair
I’ll do my best To woo your lady  Whoe'er I woo myself would be his wife
Give me excess of it that surfeiting The appetite may sicken and so die
Oh it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound That breathes upon a bank of violets Stealing and giving odor
Tis not so sweet now as it was before
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical
Will you go hunt my lord
What Curio
My lady will hang thee for thy absence
Let her hang me
Make that good
He shall see none to fear
A good lenten answer
I can tell thee where that saying was born of “I fear no colors”Where good Mistress Mary
In the wars
Well God give them wisdom that have it
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent
You are resolute then
Well go thy way
If Sir Toby would leave drinking thou wert as witty a piece of Eve’s flesh as any in Illyria
Peace you rogue no more o' that
Here comes my lady
Take the fool away
Do you not hear fellows
Take away the lady
Go to you’re a dry fool
I’ll no more of you
Besides you grow dishonest
If he cannot let the botcher mend him
Anything that’s mended is but patched
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin and sin that amends is but patched with virtue
If that this simple syllogism will serve so
If it will not what remedy
Sir I bade them take away you
Good madonna give me leave to prove you a fool
Can you do it
Dexterously good madonna
I must catechise you for it madonna
Good my mouse of virtue answer me
Well sir for want of other idleness I’ll bide your proof
Good madonna why mournest thou
Good fool for my brother’s death
I think his soul is in hell madonna
I know his soul is in heaven fool
The more fool madonna to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven
Take away the fool gentlemen
What think you of this fool Malvolio
Doth he not mend
Yes and shall do till the pangs of death shake him
Infirmity that decays the wise doth ever make the better fool
God send you sir a speedy infirmity for the better increasing your folly
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool
How say you to that Malvolio
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools' zanies
Oh you are sick of self love Malvolio and taste with a distempered appetite
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing for thou speakest well of fools
Madam there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you
From the Count Orsino is it
I know not madam
Tis a fair young man and well attended
Who of my people hold him in delay
Sir Toby madam your kinsman
He speaks nothing but madman
If it be a suit from the count I am sick or not at home
What is he at the gate cousin
A gentleman
A gentleman
What gentleman
Good Sir Toby
Lechery
I defy lechery
There’s one at the gate
Ay marry what is he
Let him be the devil an he will I care not
Give me faith say I
What’s a drunken man like fool
Like a drowned man a fool and a madman
One draught above heat makes him a fool the second mads him and a third drowns him
Go look after him
Madam yond young fellow swears he will speak with you
I told him you were sick
He takes on him to understand so much and therefore comes to speak with you
I told him you were asleep
He seems to have a foreknowledge of that too and therefore comes to speak with you
What is to be said to him lady
He’s fortified against any denial
Tell him he shall not speak with me
What manner of man
Of very ill manner
He’ll speak with you will you or no
Of what personage and years is he
Not yet old enough for a man nor young enough for a boy as a squash is before ’tis a peascod or a codling when ’tis almost an apple
Tis with him in standing water between boy and man
He is very well favored and he speaks very shrewishly
One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him
Let him approach
Call in my gentlewoman
Gentlewoman my lady calls
Give me my veil
Come throw it o'er my face
The honorable lady of the house which is she
Speak to me
I shall answer for her
Your will
Most radiant exquisite and unmatchable beauty I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house for I never saw her
I would be loath to cast away my speech for besides that it is excellently well penned I have taken great pains to con it
Good beauties let me sustain no scorn
I am very comptible even to the least sinister usage
Whence came you sir
I can say little more than I have studied and that question’s out of my part
Good gentle one give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house that I may proceed in my speech
Are you a comedian
No my profound heart
And yet by the very fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play
Are you the lady of the house
If I do not usurp myself I am
Most certain if you are she you do usurp yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve
But this is from my commission
I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message
Come to what is important in ’t
I forgive you the praise
Alas I took great pains to study it and ’tis poetical
It is the more like to be feigned
I pray you keep it in
If you be not mad be gone
Will you hoist sail sir
Here lies your way
Tell me your mind
Speak your office
It alone concerns your ear
I bring no overture of war no taxation of homage
My words are as full of peace as matter
Yet you began rudely
What are you
What would you
How now
What news from her
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead
Give us the place alone
Most sweet lady  A comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it
Where lies your text
In Orsino’s bosom
In his bosom
In what chapter of his bosom
To answer by the method in the first of his heart
Oh I have read it
It is heresy
Have you no more to say
Good madam let me see your face
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face
You are now out of your text
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture
Look you sir such a one I was this present
Is ’t not well done
Twill endure wind and weather
O sir I will not be so hard hearted
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty
But if you were the devil you are fair
My lord and master loves you
How does he love me
Your lord does know my mind
I cannot love him
Yet I suppose him virtuous know him noble Of great estate of fresh and stainless youth
In voices well divulged free learned and valiant And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person
But yet I cannot love him He might have took his answer long ago
Why what would you
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house
Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night
You might do much
Above my fortunes yet my state is well
I am a gentleman
Get you to your lord
I cannot love him
Let him send no more  Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it
Fare you well
I thank you for your pains
Spend this for me
I am no fee’d post lady
Keep your purse
My master not myself lacks recompense
Farewell fair cruelty
What is your parentage” “Above my fortunes yet my state is well
Not too fast
Soft soft
Unless the master were the man
How now
Even so quickly may one catch the plague
Well let it be  What ho Malvolio
Here madam at your service
Run after that same peevish messenger The county’s man
He left this ring behind him Would I or not
Madam I will
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind
Fate show thy force
Ourselves we do not owe
What is decreed must be and be this so
By your patience no
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound
No sooth sir
My determinate voyage is mere extravagancy
But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in
He left behind him myself and a sister both born in an hour
If the heavens had been pleased would we had so ended
But you sir altered that for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned
Alas the day
A lady sir though it was said she much resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful
She is drowned already sir with salt water though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more
O good Antonio forgive me your trouble
If you will not murder me for my love let me be your servant
Fare you well at once
I am bound to the Count Orsino’s court
Farewell
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee
I have many enemies in Orsino’s court Else would I very shortly see thee there
But come what may I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport and I will go
Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia
Even now sir
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither
She returns this ring to you sir
You might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself
Receive it so
She took the ring of me
I’ll none of it
Come sir you peevishly threw it to her and her will is it should be so returned
I left no ring with her
What means this lady
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her
She made good view of me indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue For she did speak in starts distractedly
She loves me sure
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger
I am the man
If it be so as ’tis Poor lady she were better love a dream
How will this fadge
What will become of this
O time thou must untangle this not I
It is too hard a knot for me to untie
Approach Sir Andrew
Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes andNay my troth I know not
But I know to be up late is to be up late
A false conclusion
I hate it as an unfilled can
Thou'rt a scholar
Let us therefore eat and drink
Marian I say
A stoup of wine
Here comes the fool i' faith
How now my hearts
Did you never see the picture of “We Three”
Welcome ass
Now let’s have a catch
What country friends is this
This is Illyria lady
And what should I do in Illyria
My brother he is in Elysium
Perchance he is not drown’d What think you sailors
It is perchance that you yourself were saved
O my poor brother
And so perchance may he be
True madam
Know’st thou this country
Ay madam well for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place
By my troth the fool has an excellent breast
My lady has a white hand and the Myrmidons are no bottle ale houses
If one knight give a  Would you have a love song or a song of good life
A love song a love song
Ay ay
I care not for good life
Excellent good i' faith
Good good
A mellifluous voice as I am true knight
A contagious breath
Very sweet and contagious i' faith
Shall we rouse the night owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver
Shall we do that
An you love me let’s do ’t
Most certain
Let our catch be “Thou Knave” “Hold thy peace thou knave” knight
I shall be constrained in ’t to call thee knave knight
It begins “Hold thy peace” I shall never begin if I hold my peace
Good i' faith
Come begin
What a caterwauling do you keep here
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors never trust me
For the love o' God peace
My masters are you mad
Or what are you
Have you no wit manners nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night
Is there no respect of place persons nor time in you
We did keep time sir in our catches
Sneck up
Sir Toby I must be round with you
My lady bade me tell you that though she harbors you as her kinsman she’s nothing allied to your disorders
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors you are welcome to the house
If not an it would please you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid you farewell
Nay good Sir Toby
Out o' tune sir
You lie
Yes by Saint Anne and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too
Thou'rt i' the right
Go shake your ears
Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man’s a hungry to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him
Do ’t knight
I’ll write thee a challenge
Or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth
Sweet Sir Toby be patient for tonight
Since the youth of the count’s was today with thy lady she is much out of quiet
For Monsieur Malvolio let me alone with him
I know I can do it
O if I thought that I’d beat him like a dog
I have no exquisite reason for ’t but I have reason good enough
And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work
What wilt thou do
I can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands
Excellent
I have ’t in my nose too
He shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop that they come from my niece and that she’s in love with him
My purpose is indeed a horse of that color
And your horse now would make him an ass
Ass I doubt not
Oh ’twill be admirable
Sport royal I warrant you
I know my physic will work with him
I will plant you two and let the fool make a third where he shall find the letter
Observe his construction of it
For this night to bed and dream on the event
Farewell
Good night Penthesilea
Before me she’s a good wench
She’s a beagle true bred and one that adores me
What o' that
I was adored once too
Let’s to bed knight
Thou hadst need send for more money
If thou hast her not i' the end call me “Cut”If I do not never trust me take it how you will
Tis too late to go to bed now
Give me some music
He is not here so please your lordship that should sing it
Who was it
He is about the house
Thou dost speak masterly
My life upon ’t young though thou art thine eye Hath stay’d upon some favor that it loves
Hath it not boy
A little by your favor
What kind of woman is’t
Of your complexion
She is not worth thee then
What years i' faith
About your years my lord
Too old by heaven
Let still the woman take An elder than herself
I think it well my lord
Then let thy love be younger than thyself Or thy affection cannot hold the bent
For women are as roses whose fair flower Being once displayed doth fall that very hour
And so they are
Alas that they are so To die even when they to perfection grow
Who governs here
A noble duke in nature As in name
What is his name
Orsino
Orsino
I have heard my father name him
He was a bachelor then
For but a month ago I went from hence And then ’twas fresh in murmur as you know What great ones do the less will prattle of  That he did seek the love of fair Olivia
What’s she
Oh that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world Till I had made mine own occasion mellow What my estate is
Are you ready sir
No pains sir
I take pleasure in singing sir
I’ll pay thy pleasure then
Give me now leave to leave thee
Farewell
Let all the rest give place
Once more Cesario Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
Tell her my love more noble than the world Prizes not quantity of dirty lands The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her Tell her I hold as giddily as fortune But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul
But if she cannot love you sir
I cannot be so answer’d
Sooth but you must
Say that some lady as perhaps there is Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia
Must she not then be answered
There is no woman’s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart
No woman’s heart So big to hold so much
They lack retention
Alas their love may be called appetite No motion of the liver but the palate That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt But mine is all as hungry as the sea And can digest as much
Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia
Ay but I know  What dost thou know
Too well what love women to men may owe
In faith they are as true of heart as we
My father had a daughter loved a man As it might be perhaps were I a woman I should your lordship
And what’s her history
A blank my lord
Was not this love indeed
But died thy sister of her love my boy
I am all the daughters of my father’s house And all the brothers too and yet I know not
Sir shall I to this lady
Come thy ways Signior Fabian
Nay I’ll come
If I lose a scruple of this sport let me be boiled to death with melancholy
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep biter come by some notable shame
I would exult man
You know he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a bear baiting here
To anger him we’ll have the bear again and we will fool him black and blue
Shall we not Sir Andrew
An we do not it is pity of our lives
Here comes the little villain
How now my metal of India
Get you all three into the boxtree
Malvolio’s coming down this walk
He has been yonder i' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour
Observe him for the love of mockery for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him
Who's there
Nay answer me
Stand and unfold yourself
Long live the King
Bernardo
He
You come most carefully upon your hour
tis now struck twelve
Get thee to bed Francisco
For this relief much thanks
tis bitter cold And I am sick at heart
Have you had quiet guard
Not a mouse stirring
Well good night
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus The rivals of my watch bid them make haste
I think I hear them
Stand ho
Who is there
Friends to this ground
And liegemen to the Dane
Give you good night
Bernardo hath my place
Give you good night
Say What is Horatio there
A piece of him
Welcome Horatio
Welcome good Marcellus
What has this thing appear'd again to night
I have seen nothing
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it
Tush tush 'twill not appear
Sit down awhile And let us once again assail your ears That are so fortified against our story What we two nights have seen
Well sit we down And let us hear Bernardo speak of this
Last night of all When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns Marcellus and myself The bell then beating one  Peace
Look where it comes again
In the same figure like the King that's dead
Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio
Looks it not like the King
Mark it Horatio
Most like
It harrows me with fear and wonder
It would be spoke to
Question it Horatio
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march
By heaven I charge thee speak
It is offended
See it stalks away
Stay
speak speak
I charge thee speak
tis gone and will not answer
How now Horatio
You tremble and look pale
Is not this something more than fantasy
What think you on't
Before my God I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes
Is it not like the King
As thou art to thyself
tis strange
Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
In what particular thought to work I know not But in the gross and scope of my opinion This bodes some strange eruption to our state
Who is't that can inform me
That can I At least the whisper goes so
I think it be no other but e'en so
Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the King That was and is the question of these wars
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye
In the most high and palmy state of Rome A little ere the mightiest Julius fell The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood Disasters in the sun and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
And even the like precurse of feared events As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climature and countrymen
Lo where it comes again
I'll cross it though it blast me
Stay illusion
stay and speak
Stop it Marcellus
Shall I strike at it with my partisan
Do if it will not stand
tis here
tis here
tis gone
We do it wrong being so majestical To offer it the show of violence For it is as the air invulnerable And our vain blows malicious mockery
It was about to speak when the cock crew
And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons
I have heard The cock that is the trumpet to the morn Doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat Awake the god of day and at his warning Whether in sea or fire in earth or air The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine and of the truth herein This present object made probation
It faded on the crowing of the cock
So have I heard and do in part believe it
But look the morn in russet mantle clad Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill
Break we our watch up and by my advice Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet for upon my life This spirit dumb to us will speak to him
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it As needful in our loves fitting our duty
Let's do't I pray and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently
Nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms which have freely gone With this affair along
For all our thanks
Now follows that you know young Fortinbras Holding a weak supposal of our worth Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame Colleagued with this dream of his advantage He hath not fail'd to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father with all bonds of law To our most valiant brother
So much for him
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
Thus much the business is we have here writ To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras  Who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose to suppress His further gait herein in that the levies The lists and full proportions are all made Out of his subject and we here dispatch You good Cornelius and you Voltimand For bearers of this greeting to old Norway Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow
Farewell and let your haste commend your duty
In that and all things will we show our duty
We doubt it nothing
Heartily farewell
And now Laertes what's the news with you
You told us of some suit
What is't Laertes
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane And lose your voice
What wouldst thou beg Laertes That shall not be my offer not thy asking
The head is not more native to the heart The hand more instrumental to the mouth Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
What wouldst thou have Laertes
Have you your father's leave
What says Polonius
He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition and at last Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent
I do beseech you give him leave to go
How is it that the clouds still hang on you
Not so my lord I am too much i' the sun
Good Hamlet cast thy nighted color off And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust
Ay madam it is common
If it be Why seems it so particular with thee
Seems madam
Nay it is
Fie
tis a fault to heaven A fault against the dead a fault to nature To reason most absurd whose common theme Is death of fathers and who still hath cried From the first corse till he that died today This must be so
We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe and think of us As of a father for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you
For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg It is most retrograde to our desire And we beseech you bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet
I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg
I shall in all my best obey you madam
Why 'tis a loving and a fair reply
Be as ourself in Denmark
Come away
O God
God
How weary stale flat and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world
Fie on't
ah fie
tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely
That it should come to this
But two months dead
Heaven and earth
Must I remember
Frailty thy name is woman  A little month or ere those shoes were old With which she follow'd my poor father's body Like Niobe all tears why she even she  O God
a beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mourn'd longer married with my uncle My father's brother but no more like my father Than I to Hercules
Within a month Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes She married
O most wicked speed to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets
It is not nor it cannot come to good
But break my heart for I must hold my tongue
Hail to your lordship
I am glad to see you well
Horatio or I do forget myself
The same my lord and your poor servant ever
And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio  Marcellus
A truant disposition good my lord
I would not hear your enemy say so Nor shall you do my ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself
I know you are no truant
But what is your affair in Elsinore
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart
My lord I came to see your father's funeral
I prithee do not mock me fellow student
I think it was to see my mother's wedding
Indeed my lord it followed hard upon
Thrift thrift Horatio
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day Horatio
My father methinks I see my father
O where my lord
In my mind's eye Horatio
He was a man take him for all in all I shall not look upon his like again
My lord I think I saw him yesternight
My lord the King your father
The King my father
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you
For God's love let me hear
But where was this
My lord upon the platform where we watch'd
Did you not speak to it
My lord I did But answer made it none
tis very strange
As I do live my honour'd lord 'tis true And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it
Hold you the watch tonight
We do my lord
Arm'd say you
Arm'd my lord
From top to toe
My lord from head to foot
Then saw you not his face
O yes my lord
He wore his beaver up
What look'd he frowningly
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger
Pale or red
Nay very pale
And fix'd his eyes upon you
Most constantly
I would I had been there
It would have much amazed you
Very like very like
Stay'd it long
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
Longer longer
Not when I saw't
His beard was grizzled no
It was as I have seen it in his life A sable silvered
I warrant it will
If it assume my noble father's person I'll speak to it though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace
I pray you all If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight Let it be tenable in your silence still And whatsoever else shall hap tonight Give it an understanding but no tongue
I will requite your loves
So fare you well
Upon the platform 'twixt eleven and twelve I'll visit you
Our duty to your honour
Your loves as mine to you
Farewell
My father's spirit in arms
Would the night were come
Till then sit still my soul
Foul deeds will rise Though all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes
My necessaries are embark'd
Farewell
And sister as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant do not sleep But let me hear from you
Do you doubt that
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favours Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood A violet in the youth of primy nature Forward not permanent sweet not lasting The perfume and suppliance of a minute No more
Think it no more
For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal
He may not as unvalued persons do Carve for himself for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head
Then if he says he loves you It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open To his unmast'red importunity
Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister And keep you in the rear of your affection Out of the shot and danger of desire
The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes
The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosed And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent
Youth to itself rebels though none else near
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart
But good my brother Do not as some ungracious pastors do Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whilst like a puff'd and reckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede
O fear me not
I stay too long
But here my father comes
A double blessing is a double grace Occasion smiles upon a second leave
Yet here Laertes
Aboard aboard for shame
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stay'd for
There my blessing with thee
And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character
Give thy thoughts no tongue Nor any unproportion'd thought his act
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new hatch'd unfledged comrade
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel but being in Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee
This above all to thine own self be true And it must follow as the night the day Thou canst not then be false to any man
Farewell
My blessing season this in thee
Most humbly do I take my leave my lord
Farewell Ophelia and remember well What I have said to you
tis in my memory lock'd And you yourself shall keep the key of it
Farewell
What is't Ophelia he hath said to you
So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet
Marry well bethought
What is between you
Give me up the truth
He hath my lord of late made many tenders Of his affection to me
Affection
Pooh
You speak like a green girl Unsifted in such perilous circumstance
Do you believe his tenders as you call them
I do not know my lord what I should think
Marry I'll teach you
Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay Which are not sterling
Tender yourself more dearly Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase Running it thus you'll tender me a fool
My lord he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion
And hath given countenance to his speech my lord With almost all the holy vows of heaven
Ay springes to catch woodcocks
I do know When the blood burns how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows
These blazes daughter Giving more light than heat extinct in both Even in their promise as it is a making You must not take for fire
For Lord Hamlet Believe so much in him that he is young And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you
In few Ophelia Do not believe his vows for they are brokers Not of that dye which their investments show But mere implorators of unholy suits Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds The better to beguile
Look to't I charge you
Come your ways
I shall obey my lord
The air bites shrewdly it is very cold
It is a nipping and an eager air
What hour now
I think it lacks of twelve
No it is struck
Indeed
I heard it not
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
What doth this mean my lord
The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse Keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down The kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge
Is it a custom
Ay marry is't But to my mind though I am native here And to the manner born it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance
So oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature in them As in their birth wherein they are not guilty Since nature cannot choose his origin  By the o'ergrowth of some complexion Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners that these men  Carrying I say the stamp of one defect Being nature's livery or fortune's star  Their virtues else be they as pure as grace As infinite as man may undergo  Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal
Look my lord it comes
Angels and ministers of grace defend us
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell Be thy intents wicked or charitable Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee
O answer me
Let me not burst in ignorance but tell Why thy canonized bones hearsed in death Have burst their cerements why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again
What may this mean That thou dead corse again in complete steel Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon Making night hideous and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
Say why is this
Wherefore
What should we do
It beckons you to go away with it As if it some impartment did desire To you alone
Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground
But do not go with it
No by no means
It will not speak then will I follow it
Do not my lord
Why what should be the fear
I do not set my life at a pin's fee And for my soul what can it do to that Being a thing immortal as itself
It waves me forth again
I'll follow it
What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness
Think of it
The very place puts toys of desperation Without more motive into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath
It waves me still
Go on I'll follow thee
You shall not go my lord
Hold off your hands
You shall not go
My fate cries out And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve
By heaven I'll make a ghost of him that lets me
I say away
He waxes desperate with imagination
Have after
To what issue will this come
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
Heaven will direct it
Nay let's follow him
Whither wilt thou lead me
Speak
I'll go no further
Mark me
I will
Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold
Speak I am bound to hear
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
What
I am thy father's spirit Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confined to fast in fires Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand an end Like quills upon the fretful porpentine
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood
List list O list
If thou didst ever thy dear father love  O God
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
Murder
Murder most foul as in the best it is But this most foul strange and unnatural
Haste me to know't that I with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love May sweep to my revenge
I find thee apt And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf Wouldst thou not stir in this
Now Hamlet hear
tis given out that sleeping in mine orchard A serpent stung me
O my prophetic soul
My uncle
O Hamlet what a falling off was there
But virtue as it never will be moved Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven So lust though to a radiant angel link'd Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage
But soft
O horrible
O horrible
most horrible
But howsoever thou pursuest this act Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her
Fare thee well at once
The glow worm shows the matin to be near And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire
Adieu adieu adieu
Remember me
O all you host of heaven
O earth
What else
And shall I couple hell
O fie
Remember thee
Ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe
Remember thee
Yea from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records All saws of books all forms all pressures past That youth and observation copied there And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain Unmix'd with baser matter
Yes by heaven
O most pernicious woman
O villain villain smiling damned villain
My tables meet it is I set it down That one may smile and smile and be a villain At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark
So uncle there you are
Now to my word It is ‘Adieu adieu
Remember me’ I have sworn't
My lord my lord
So be it
Illo ho ho my lord
Hillo ho ho boy
Come bird come
How is't my noble lord
What news my lord
O wonderful
Good my lord tell it
No you will reveal it
Not I my lord by heaven
Nor I my lord
How say you then would heart of man once think it
But you'll be secret
Ay by heaven my lord
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he's an arrant knave
There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave To tell us this
These are but wild and whirling words my lord
I am sorry they offend you heartily Yes faith heartily
There's no offence my lord
Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio And much offence too
Touching this vision here It is an honest ghost that let me tell you
For your desire to know what is between us O'ermaster't as you may
And now good friends As you are friends scholars and soldiers Give me one poor request
What is't my lord
We will
Never make known what you have seen to night
My lord we will not
Nay but swear't
In faith My lord not I
Nor I my lord in faith
Upon my sword
We have sworn my lord already
Indeed upon my sword indeed
Swear
Art thou there truepenny
Come on
Propose the oath my lord
Swear
Hic et ubique
Then we'll shift our ground
Come hither gentlemen And lay your hands again upon my sword
Never to speak of this that you have heard Swear by my sword
Swear
Well said old mole
Canst work i' the earth so fast
A worthy pioner
Once more remove good friends
O day and night but this is wondrous strange
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio Than are dreamt of in your philosophy
Swear
Rest rest perturbed spirit
Let us go in together And still your fingers on your lips I pray
The time is out of joint
O cursed spite That ever I was born to set it right
Nay come let's go together
Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo
I will my lord
You shall do marvellous wisely good Reynaldo Before you visit him to make inquire Of his behaviour
My lord I did intend it
Marry well said very well said
Look you sir Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris And how and who what means and where they keep What company at what expense and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it
Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him As thus ‘I know his father and his friends And in part him’ Do you mark this Reynaldo
Ay very well my lord
And in part him but’ you may say ‘not well
As gaming my lord
Ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling Drabbing
You may go so far
My lord that would dishonour him
Faith no as you may season it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him That he is open to incontinency
That's not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind A savageness in unreclaimed blood Of general assault
But my good lord  Wherefore should you do this
Ay my lord I would know that
Marry sir here's my drift And I believe it is a fetch of warrant
And then sir does he this he does what was I about to say
So by my former lecture and advice Shall you my son
You have me have you not
My lord I have
Good my lord
Observe his inclination in yourself
I shall my lord
And let him play his music
Well my lord
Farewell
O my lord my lord I have been so affrighted
With what i' the name of God
My lord as I was sewing in my closet Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced No hat upon his head his stockings fouled Ungartered and down gyved to his ankle Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors he comes before me
Mad for thy love
My lord I do not know But truly I do fear it
What said he
He took me by the wrist and held me hard Then goes he to the length of all his arm And with his other hand thus o'er his brow He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it
Come go with me
I will go seek the King
This is the very ecstasy of love Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures
No my good lord but as you did command I did repel his letters and denied His access to me
That hath made him mad
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him
I fear'd he did but trifle And meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousy
By heaven it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion
Come go we to the King
This must be known which being kept close might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love
Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Moreover that we much did long to see you The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending
What it should be More than his father's death that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself I cannot dream of
I entreat you both That being of so young days brought up with him And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures and to gather So much as from occasion you may glean Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That open'd lies within our remedy
Good gentlemen he hath much talk'd of you And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres
If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile For the supply and profit of our hope Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king's remembrance
Both your Majesties Might by the sovereign power you have of us Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty
But we both obey And here give up ourselves in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded
Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern
Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son
Go some of you And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him
Ay amen
The ambassadors from Norway my good lord Are joyfully return'd
Thou still hast been the father of good news
Have I my lord
Assure you my good liege I hold my duty as I hold my soul Both to my God and to my gracious King
And I do think or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy
Thyself do grace to them and bring them in
He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper
I doubt it is no other but the main His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage
Well we shall sift him
Welcome my good friends
Say Voltimand what from our brother Norway
It likes us well And at our more consider'd time we'll read Answer and think upon this business
Meantime we thank you for your well took labour
Go to your rest at night we'll feast together
Most welcome home
This business is well ended
Mad call I it for to define true madness What is't but to be nothing else but mad
But let that go
Madam I swear I use no art at all
Thus it remains and the remainder thus
Perpend
I have a daughter have while she is mine  Who in her duty and obedience mark Hath given me this
Now gather and surmise
Doubt thou the stars are fire Doubt that the sun doth move Doubt truth to be a liar But never doubt I love
O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers I have not art to reckon my groans
But that I love thee best O most best believe it
Adieu
Thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him Hamlet
This in obedience hath my daughter shown me And more above hath his solicitings As they fell out by time by means and place All given to mine ear
But how hath she Receiv'd his love
What do you think of me
As of a man faithful and honourable
I would fain prove so
Do you think 'tis this
It may be very like
Hath there been such a time I would fain know that  That I have positively said ‘'tis so’ When it proved otherwise
Not that I know
Take this from this if this be otherwise
If circumstances lead me I will find Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed Within the centre
How may we try it further
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby
So he does indeed
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him
Be you and I behind an arras then Mark the encounter
If he love her not And he not from his reason fall'n thereon Let me be no assistant for a state But keep a farm and carters
We will try it
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
O give me leave
How does my good Lord Hamlet
Well God a mercy
Do you know me my lord
Not I my lord
Then I would you were so honest a man
Honest my lord
That's very true my lord
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion Have you a daughter
I have my lord
Let her not walk i' th' sun
Conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
Friend look to't
How say you by that
Still harping on my daughter
He is far gone
And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love very near this
Words words words
What is the matter my lord
Between who
I mean the matter that you read my lord
All which sir though I most powerfully and potently believe yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir shall grow old as I am if if like a crab you could go backward
Into my grave
Indeed that is out of the air
Aside
How sometimes his replies are
a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of
You cannot sir take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life
Fare you well my lord
These tedious old fools
God save you sir
My honoured lord
My most dear lord
My excellent good friends
How dost thou Guildenstern
Ah Rosencrantz
Good lads how do ye both
As the indifferent children of the earth
Nor the soles of her shoe
Neither my lord
Then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours
Faith her privates we
In the secret parts of Fortune
What news
None my lord but that the world's grown honest
Prison my lord
Denmark's a prison
Then is the world one
A goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons Denmark being one o' the worst
We think not so my lord
Why then 'tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so
To me it is a prison
O God I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreams
Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
A dream itself is but a shadow
Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow
Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows
Shall we to the court
For by my fay I cannot reason
We'll wait upon you
No such matter
I will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man I am most dreadfully attended
But in the beaten way of friend  ship what make you at Elsinore
To visit you my lord no other occasion
Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you And sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny
Were you not sent for
Is it your own inclin  ing
Is it a free visitation
Come deal justly with me
What should we say my lord
Why anything but to the purpose
You were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour
I know the good King and Queen have sent for you
To what end my lord
That you must teach me
But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no
What say you
My lord we were sent for
I have of late but wherefore I know not  lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o'erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
What a piece of work is a man
how noble in reason
how infinite in faculty
in form and moving how express and admirable
in action how like an angel
in apprehension how like a god
And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust
Man delights not me no nor woman nei  ther though by your smiling you seem to say so
My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
Why did you laugh then when I said man delights not me
To think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you
We coted them on the way and hither are they com  ing to offer you service
What players are they
Even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city
How chances it they travel
Their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city
Are they so followed
No indeed are they not
How comes it
Do they grow rusty
Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an eyrie of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't
These are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither
What are they children
Who maintains 'em
How are they escoted
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing
Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession
Faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controver  sy
There was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question
Is't possible
O there has been much throwing about of brains
Do the boys carry it away
Ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too
It is not very strange for my uncle is King of Denmark and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little
Sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out
There are the players
Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore
Your hands come
Then appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony
Let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which I tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like entertainment than yours
You are welcome
But my uncle father and aunt  mother are deceived
In what my dear lord
I am but mad north north west
When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw
Well be with you gentlemen
Hark you Guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts
Happily he's the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players
Mark it
You say right sir o' Monday morning 'twas so indeed
Buzz buzz
Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus too light
For the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men
O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thou
What treasure had he my lord
Why ‘One fair daughter and no more The which he loved passing well’ Still on my daughter
Am I not i' the right old Jephthah
If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I love passing well
Nay that follows not
What follows then my lord
Why As by lot God wot and then you know It came to pass as most like it was  The first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look where my abridgment comes
You are welcome masters welcome all
I am glad to see thee well
Welcome good friends
What my young lady and mistress
By'r lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine
Pray God your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring
Masters you are all welcome
We'll e'en to't like French falconers fly at any thing we see
We'll have a speech straight
Come give us a taste of your quality
Come a passionate speech
What speech my good lord
I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play I remember pleased not the million 'twas caviary to the general but it was as I received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much mod  esty as cunning
I remember one said there were no sal  lets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no mat  ter in the phrase that might indict the author of affecta  tion but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine
Head to foot Now is he total gules horridly trick'd With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion
Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks
His antique sword Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls Repugnant to command
Unequal match'd Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword The unnerved father falls
Then senseless Ilium Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear
For lo
his sword Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam seem'd i' the air to stick
So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood And like a neutral to his will and matter Did nothing
But as we often see against some storm A silence in the heavens the rack stand still The bold winds speechless and the orb below As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus' pause Aroused vengeance sets him new a work And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam
Out out thou strumpet Fortune
All you gods In general synod take away her power Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven As low as to the fiends
This is too long
It shall to the barber's with your beard
Prithee say on
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps
Say on come to Hecuba
mobled queen’ is good
Run barefoot up and down threatening the flames With bisson rheum a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood and for a robe About her lank and all o'erteemed loins A blanket in the alarm of fear caught up  Who this had seen with tongue in venom steep'd 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced
But if the gods themselves did see her then When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs The instant burst of clamour that she made Unless things mortal move them not at all Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven And passion in the gods
Look whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes
Prithee no more
tis well
I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon
Good my lord will you see the players well bestow'd
Do you hear
Let them be well used for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time
After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live
My lord I will use them according to their desert
God's bodykins man much better
Use every man after his desert and who shall 'scape whipping
Use them after your own honour and dignity
The less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
Take them in
Come sirs
Follow him friends
We'll hear a play to morrow
Dost thou hear me old friend
We'll ha't tomorrow night
Ay my lord
Very well
Follow that lord and look you mock him not
My good friends I'll leave you till night
You are wel  come to Elsinore
Good my lord
Ay so God be wi' ye
Now I am alone
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I
Is it not monstrous that this player here But in a fiction in a dream of passion Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wann'd Tears in his eyes distraction in's aspect A broken voice and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit
And all for nothing
For Hecuba
What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba That he should weep for her
What would he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have
He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech Make mad the guilty and appal the free Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears
Am I a coward
Who calls me villain
breaks my pate across
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
Tweaks me by the nose
gives me the lie i' the throat As deep as to the lungs
Bloody bawdy villain
Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
O vengeance
Why what an ass am I
This is most brave That I the son of a dear father murder'd Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell Must like a whore unpack my heart with words And fall a cursing like a very drab A scullion
Fie upon't
Foh
About my brain
Hum I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions For murder though it have no tongue will speak With most miraculous organ I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle
I'll observe his looks I'll tent him to the quick
If he but blench I know my course
I'll have grounds More relative than this
The play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy
He does confess he feels himself distracted But from what cause he will by no means speak
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded But with a crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state
Did he receive you well
Most like a gentleman
But with much forcing of his disposition
Niggard of question but of our demands Most free in his reply
Did you assay him To any pastime
Madam it so fell out that certain players We o'erraught on the way
Of these we told him And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it
They are here about the court And as I think they have already order This night to play before him
tis most true And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter
With all my heart and it doth much content me To hear him so inclin'd
Good gentlemen give him a further edge And drive his purpose on to these delights
We shall my lord
Sweet Gertrude leave us too For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither That he as 'twere by accident may here Affront Ophelia
Her father and myself lawful espials Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen We may of their encounter frankly judge And gather by him as he is behaved If't be the affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for
So shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again To both your honours
Madam I wish it may
Ophelia walk you here
Gracious so please you We will bestow ourselves
Read on this book That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness
We are oft to blame in this  'tis too much proved that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The Devil himself
O 'tis too true
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
The harlot's cheek beautied with plastering art Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word
O heavy burden
I hear him coming
Let's withdraw my lord
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time The oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely The pangs of disprized love the law's delay The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin
Who would fardels bear To grunt and sweat under a weary life But that the dread of something after death The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveller returns puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought And enterprises of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action
Soft you now
The fair Ophelia
Nymph in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered
Good my lord How does your honour for this many a day
I humbly thank you well well well
My lord I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to redeliver
I pray you now receive them
My honour'd lord you know right well you did And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd As made the things more rich
Their perfume lost Take these again for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
There my lord
Are you honest
My lord
Are you fair
What means your lordship
That if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty
Could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty
Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness
This was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof
I did love you once
Indeed my lord you made me believe so
You should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it
I loved you not
I was the more deceived
Get thee to a nunnery
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners
I am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me
I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven
We are arrant knaves all believe none of us
Go thy ways to a nunnery
Where's your father
At home my lord
Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house
Farewell
O help him you sweet heavens
If thou dost marry I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny
Get thee to a nunnery
Go farewell
Or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them
To a nunnery go and quickly too
Farewell
O heavenly powers restore him
You jig you amble and you lisp and nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance
I say we will have no more marriages
Those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are
To a nunnery go
O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown
The courtier's scholar's soldier's eye tongue sword The expectancy and rose of the fair state The glass of fashion and the mould of form The observed of all observers quite quite down
And I of ladies most deject and wretched That suck'd the honey of his music vows Now see that noble and most sovereign reason Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy
O woe is me To have seen what I have seen see what I see
Love
His affections do not that way tend Nor what he spake though it lack'd form a little Was not like madness
There's something in his soul O'er which his melancholy sits on brood And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger which for to prevent I have in quick determination Thus set it down he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something settled matter in his heart Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself
What think you on't
It shall do well
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love
How now Ophelia
My lord do as you please But if you hold it fit after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief
Let her be round with him And I'll be placed so please you in the ear Of all their conference
If she find him not To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think
It shall be so
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go
Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue
But if you mouth it as many of our players do I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines
O it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise
Pray you avoid it
I warrant your honour
Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor
Suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure
Now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others
O there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us sir
O reform it altogether
That's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it
Go make you ready
How now my lord
Will the King hear this piece of work
And the Queen too and that presently
We will my lord
What ho Horatio
Here sweet lord at your service
Horatio thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation cop'd withal
Why should the poor be flatter'd
No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning
Dost thou hear
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish her election Sh'hath seal'd thee for herself
For thou hast been As one in suff'ring all that suffers nothing A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commeddled That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger To sound what stop she please
Give me that man That is not passion's slave and I will wear him In my heart's core ay in my heart of heart As I do thee
Something too much of this
There is a play tonight before the King
One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father's death
I prithee when thou seest that act afoot Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe my uncle
If his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech It is a damned ghost that we have seen And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy
Give him heedful note For I mine eyes will rivet to his face And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming
Well my lord
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing And 'scape detecting I will pay the theft
They are coming to the play
I must be idle
Get you a place
How fares our cousin Hamlet
Excellent i' faith of the chameleon's dish
I eat the air promise cramm'd
You cannot feed capons so
No nor mine now
My lord you play'd once i' th' university you say
That did I my lord and was accounted a good actor
What did you enact
I did enact Julius Caesar I was killed i' the Capitol Brutus killed me
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there
Be the players ready
Come hither my dear Hamlet sit by me
O ho
do you mark that
Lady shall I lie in your lap
No my lord
I mean my head upon your lap
Ay my lord
Do you think I meant country matters
I think nothing my lord
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs
What is my lord
Nothing
You are merry my lord
Who I
Ay my lord
O God your only jig maker
What should a man do but be merry
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within's two hours
Nay 'tis twice two months my lord
So long
Nay then let the devil wear black for I'll have a suit of sables
O heavens
die two months ago and not forgotten yet
Marry this is miching mallecho it means mischief
Belike this show imports the argument of the play
We shall know by this fellow
The players cannot keep counsel they'll tell all
Will he tell us what this show meant
Ay or any show that you'll show him
Be not you ashamed to show he'll not shame to tell you what it means
You are naught you are naught
I'll mark the play
For us and for our tragedy Here stooping to your clemency We beg your hearing patiently
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
tis brief my lord
As woman's love
So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o'er ere love be done
That I distrust you
Now what my love is proof hath made you know And as my love is sized my fear is so
Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear Where little fears grow great great love grows there
Such love must needs be treason in my breast
In second husband let me be accurst
None wed the second but who killed the first
The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift but none of love
A second time I kill my husband dead When second husband kisses me in bed
I do believe you think what now you speak But what we do determine oft we break
Purpose is but the slave to memory Of violent birth but poor validity Which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree But fall unshaken when they mellow be
Most necessary 'tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
What to ourselves in passion we propose The passion ending doth the purpose lose
The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy
Where joy most revels grief doth most lament Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
This world is not for aye nor 'tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change For 'tis a question left us yet to prove Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
But orderly to end where I begun Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
So think thou wilt no second husband wed But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
If she should break it now
tis deeply sworn
Sleep rock thy brain And never come mischance between us twain
Madam how like you this play
The lady doth protest too much methinks
O but she'll keep her word
Have you heard the argument
Is there no offence in't
No no
They do but jest poison in jest no offence i' the world
What do you call the play
The Mousetrap
Marry how
Tropically
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna
tis a knavish piece of work but what o' that
Your Majesty and we that have free souls it touches us not
Let the galled jade winch our withers are unwrung
This is one Lucianus nephew to the King
You are as good as a chorus my lord
I could interpret between you and your love if I could see the puppets dallying
You are keen my lord you are keen
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
Still better and worse
So you must take your husbands
Begin murderer
Pox leave thy damnable faces and begin
He poisons him i' the garden for his estate
His name's Gonzago
The King rises
What frighted with false fire
How fares my lord
Give o'er the play
Give me some light
Away
Lights lights lights
Would not this sir and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players sir
Half a share
You might have rhymed
O good Horatio I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound
Didst perceive
Very well my lord
Upon the talk of the poisoning
I did very well note him
Ah ha
Come some music
Come some music
Good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you
Sir a whole history
The King sir  Ay sir what of him
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered
With drink sir
No my lord rather with choler
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler
Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair
I am tame sir
Pronounce
The Queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit hath sent me to you
You are welcome
Nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed
Sir I cannot
What my lord
But sir such answer as I can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother
Therefore no more but to the matter
O wonderful son that can so astonish a mother
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed
We shall obey were she ten times our mother
Have you any further trade with us
My lord you once did love me
So I do still by these pickers and stealers
Good my lord what is your cause of distemper
You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend
Sir I lack advancement
How can that be when you have the voice of the King himself for your succession in Denmark
Ay sir but 'while the grass grows' the proverb is something musty
O the recorders
Let me see one
To withdraw with you  why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil
O my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly
I do not well understand that
Will you play upon this pipe
My lord I cannot
I pray you
Believe me I cannot
I do beseech you
I know no touch of it my lord
It is as easy as lying
Govern these ventages with your fingers and thumbs give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
Look you these are the stops
Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me
You would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak
Sblood do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe
Call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me
God bless you sir
My lord the Queen would speak with you and presently
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel
By the mass and 'tis like a camel indeed
Methinks it is like a weasel
It is backed like a weasel
Or like a whale
Very like a whale
Then will I come to my mother by and by
I will say so
By and by' is easily said
Leave me friends
tis now the very witching time of night When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on
Soft
now to my mother
O heart lose not thy nature let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom
I like him not nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow Out of his brows
We will ourselves provide
Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your Majesty
The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armour of the mind To keep itself from noyance but much more That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests The lives of many
The cess of majesty Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw What's near it with it
It is a massy wheel Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoin'd which when it falls Each small annexment petty consequence Attends the boisterous ruin
Never alone Did the King sigh but with a general groan
Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage For we will fetters put upon this fear Which now goes too free footed
We will haste us
My lord he's going to his mother's closet
Behind the arras I'll convey myself To hear the process
I'll warrant she'll tax him home And as you said and wisely was it said 'tis meet that some more audience than a mother Since nature makes them partial should o'erhear The speech of vantage
Fare you well my liege
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know
Thanks dear my lord
What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow
Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence
And what's in prayer but this twofold force To be forestalled ere we come to fall Or pardon'd being down
Then I'll look up My fault is past
But O what form of prayer Can serve my turn
Forgive me my foul murder
That cannot be since I am still possess'd Of those effects for which I did the murder  My crown mine own ambition and my queen
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence
What then
What rests
Try what repentance can
What can it not
O bosom black as death
O limed soul that struggling to be free Art more engaged
Help angels
Make assay
Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel Be soft as sinews of the new born babe
All may be well
That would be scann'd
A villain kills my father and for that I his sole son do this same villain send To heaven
O this is hire and salary not revenge
He took my father grossly full of bread With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May And how his audit stands who knows save heaven
No
Up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
When he is drunk asleep or in his rage Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed At game a swearing or about some act That has no relish of salvation in't Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven And that his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell whereto it goes
My mother stays
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days
My words fly up my thoughts remain below
Words without thoughts never to heaven go
He will come straight
Look you lay home to him
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between Much heat and him
I'll silence me even here
Pray you be round with him
Withdraw I hear him coming
Now mother what's the matter
Hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
Mother you have my father much offended
Come come you answer with an idle tongue
Go go you question with a wicked tongue
Why how now Hamlet
What's the matter now
Have you forgot me
No by the rood not so
You are the Queen your husband's brother's wife And would it were not so you are my mother
Nay then I'll set those to you that can speak
What wilt thou do
Thou wilt not murder me
Help help ho
What ho
Help help help
Draws
O I am slain
O me what hast thou done
Nay I know not
Is it the King
O what a rash and bloody deed is this
A bloody deed
Almost as bad good mother As kill a king and marry with his brother
As kill a king
Ay lady it was my word
Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
I took thee for thy better
Leave wringing of your hands
Peace
What have I done that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me
Heaven's face doth glow Yea this solidity and compound mass With tristful visage as against the doom Is thought sick at the act
Ay me what act That roars so loud and thunders in the index
Look here upon this picture and on this The counterfeit presentment of two brothers
Here is your husband like a mildew'd ear Blasting his wholesome brother
Have you eyes
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed And batten on this Moor
Ha
have you eyes
What devil was't That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman blind
Eyes without feeling feeling without sight Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope
O shame
where is thy blush
Rebellious hell If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones To flaming youth let virtue be as wax And melt in her own fire
Proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will
O Hamlet speak no more
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct
Nay but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed Stew'd in corruption honeying and making love Over the nasty sty
No more
A king of shreds and patches
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings You heavenly guards
What would your gracious figure
Alas he's mad
Do you not come your tardy son to chide That lapsed in time and passion lets go by The important acting of your dread command
O say
Do not forget
This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
But look amazement on thy mother sits
Speak to her Hamlet
How is it with you lady
Alas how is't with you That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with the incorporal air do hold discourse
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep And as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm Your bedded hairs like life in excrements Start up and stand on end
O gentle son Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience
Whereon do you look
On him on him
Look you how pale he glares
Then what I have to do Will want true colour tears perchance for blood
To whom do you speak this
Do you see nothing there
Nothing at all yet all that is I see
Nor did you nothing hear
No nothing but ourselves
Why look you there
Look how it steals away
My father in his habit as he liv'd
Look where he goes even now out at the portal
This is the very coinage of your brain
This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in
Ecstasy
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time And makes as healthful music
It is not madness That I have utt'red
Bring me to the test And I the matter will reword which madness Would gambol from
Mother for love of grace Lay not that flattering unction to your soul That not your trespass but my madness speaks
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place Whiles rank corruption mining all within Infects unseen
Confess yourself to heaven Repent what's past avoid what is to come And do not spread the compost on the weeds To make them ranker
Forgive me this my virtue For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
O throw away the worser part of it And live the purer with the other half Good night but go not to my uncle's bed
Assume a virtue if you have it not
That monster custom who all sense doth eat Of habits evil is angel yet in this That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery That aptly is put on
Refrain to night And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence the next more easy For use almost can change the stamp of nature And [either master] the devil or throw him out With wondrous potency
For this same lord I do repent but heaven hath pleas'd it so To punish me with this and this with me That I must be their scourge and minister
I will bestow him and will answer well The death I gave him
So again good night
One word more good lady
What shall I do
Twere good you let him know For who that's but a queen fair sober wise Would from a paddock from a bat a gib Such dear concernings hide
Who would do so
No in despite of sense and secrecy Unpeg the basket on the house's top Let the birds fly and like the famous ape To try conclusions in the basket creep And break your own neck down
Be thou assur'd if words be made of breath And breath of life I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me
I must to England you know that
Alack I had forgot
Let it work For 'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petar and ' shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon
O 'tis most sweet When in one line two crafts directly meet
Mother good night
Indeed this counsellor Is now most still most secret and most grave Who was in life a foolish prating knave
Come sir to draw toward an end with you
Good night mother
There's matter in these sighs
Where is your son
Bestow this place on us a little while
Ah mine own lord what have I seen tonight
What Gertrude
How does Hamlet
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend Which is the mightier
In his lawless fit Behind the arras hearing something stir Whips out his rapier cries 'A rat a rat
And in this brainish apprehension kills The unseen good old man
O heavy deed
It had been so with us had we been there
His liberty is full of threats to all To you yourself to us to every one
Alas how shall this bloody deed be answer'd
It will be laid to us whose providence Should have kept short restrain'd and out of haunt This mad young man
But so much was our love We would not understand what was most fit But like the owner of a foul disease To keep it from divulging let it feed Even on the pith of life
Where is he gone
He weeps for what is done
O Gertrude come away
Ho Guildenstern
Friends both go join you with some further aid
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him
Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body Into the chapel
I pray you haste in this
Come Gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends And let them know both what we mean to do And what's untimely done
So haply slander Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter As level as the cannon to his blank Transports his poisoned shot may miss our name And hit the woundless air O come away
My soul is full of discord and dismay
Safely stow'd
Hamlet
Lord Hamlet
What noise
Who calls on Hamlet
O here they come
What have you done my lord with the dead body
Compounded it with dust whereto 'tis kin
Tell us where 'tis that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel
Do not believe it
Believe what
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own
Take you me for a sponge my lord
Ay sir that soaks up the King's countenance his rewards his authorities
But such officers do the King best service in the end
He keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouth'd to be last swallowed
When he needs what you have glean'd it is but squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again
I understand you not my lord
I am glad of it
A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear
My lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King
The body is with the King but the King is not with the body
The King is a thing  A thing my lord
Of nothing
Bring me to him
Hide fox and all after
I have sent to seek him and to find the body
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose
Yet must not we put the strong law on him
He's loved of the distracted multitude Who like not in their judgment but their eyes And where 'tis so the offender's scourge is weigh'd But never the offence
To bear all smooth and even This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause
Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved Or not at all
Where the dead body is bestow'd my lord We cannot get from him
But where is he
Without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
Bring him before us
Ho Guildenstern
Bring in my lord
Now Hamlet where's Polonius
At supper
At supper
Where
Not where he eats but where he is eaten
A certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him
Your worm is your only emperor for diet
We fat all creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for maggots
Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service two dishes but to one table
That's the end
Alas alas
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm
What dost thou mean by this
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar
Where is Polonius
In heaven
Send thither to see
If your messenger find him not there seek him i' the other place yourself
But indeed if you find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up the stair into the lobby
Go seek him there
He will stay till you come
Hamlet this deed for thine especial safety  Which we do tender as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done must send thee hence With fiery quickness
For England
Ay Hamlet
Good
So is it if thou knew'st our purposes
I see a cherub that sees them
But come for England
Farewell dear mother
Thy loving father Hamlet
My mother
Father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother
Come for England
Delay it not I'll have him hence tonight
Away
for every thing is seal'd and done That else leans on the affair
Pray you make haste
And England if my love thou hold'st at aught  As my great power thereof may give thee sense Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword and thy free awe Pays homage to us thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process which imports at full By letters congruing to that effect The present death of Hamlet
Do it England For like the hectic in my blood he rages And thou must cure me
Till I know 'tis done Howe'er my haps my joys were ne'er begun
Go Captain from me greet the Danish king
Tell him that by his license Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promised march Over his kingdom
You know the rendezvous
If that his Majesty would aught with us We shall express our duty in his eye And let him know so
I will do't my lord
Go softly on
Good sir whose powers are these
They are of Norway sir
How purposed sir I pray you
Against some part of Poland
Who commands them sir
The nephew to old Norway Fortinbras
Goes it against the main of Poland sir Or for some frontier
Truly to speak and with no addition We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name
To pay five ducats five I would not farm it Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate should it be sold in fee
Why then the Polack never will defend it
Yes it is already garrison'd
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace That inward breaks and shows no cause without Why the man dies
I humbly thank you sir
God be wi' you sir
Will't please you go my lord
I'll be with you straight
Go a little before
How all occasions do inform against me And spur my dull revenge
What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed
A beast no more
Sure he that made us with such large discourse Looking before and after gave us not That capability and godlike reason To fust in us unused
Now whether it be Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on the event  A thought which quarter'd hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward I do not know Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do' Sith I have cause and will and strength and means To do't
Examples gross as earth exhort me
Witness this army of such mass and charge Led by a delicate and tender prince Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd Makes mouths at the invisible event Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune death and danger dare Even for an eggshell
Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honour's at the stake
How stand I then That have a father kill'd a mother stain'd Excitements of my reason and my blood And let all sleep while to my shame I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men That for a fantasy and trick of fame Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain
O from this time forth My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth
I will not speak with her
She is importunate indeed distract
Her mood will needs be pitied
What would she have
She speaks much of her father says she hears There's tricks i' the world and hems and beats her heart Spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt That carry but half sense
Her speech is nothing Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection they aim at it And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts Which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them Indeed would make one think there might be thought Though nothing sure yet much unhappily
Twere good she were spoken with for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill breeding minds
Let her come in
To my sick soul as sin's true nature is Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss
So full of artless jealousy is guilt It spills itself in fearing to be spilt
Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark
How should I your true love know From another one
By his cockle hat and staff And his sandal shoon
Alas sweet lady what imports this song
Say you
Nay pray you mark
He is dead and gone lady He is dead and gone At his head a grass green turf At his heels a stone
Nay but Ophelia  Pray you mark
White his shroud as the mountain snow  Alas look here my lord
Larded all with sweet flowers Which bewept to the grave did not go With true love showers
How do you pretty lady
Well God 'eild you
They say the owl was a baker's daughter
Lord we know what we are but know not what we may be
God be at your table
Conceit upon her father
Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es And dupp'd the chamber door Let in the maid that out a maid Never departed more
Pretty Ophelia
Indeed without an oath I'll make an end on't
By Gis and by Saint Charity Alack and fie for shame
Young men will do't if they come to't By Cock they are to blame
How long hath she been thus
I hope all will be well
We must be patient
But I can  not choose but weep to think they would lay him i' the cold ground
My brother shall know of it
And so I thank you for your good counsel
Come my coach
Follow her close give her good watch I pray you
O this is the poison of deep grief it springs All from her father's death
O my dear Gertrude this Like to a murdering piece in many places Gives me superfluous death
Alack what noise is this
Where are my Switzers
Let them guard the door
What is the matter
Save yourself my lord
The ocean overpeering of his list Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes in a riotous head O'erbears your offices
The rabble call him lord And as the world were now but to begin Antiquity forgot custom not known  The ratifiers and props of every word  They cry 'Choose we
O this is counter you false Danish dogs
The doors are broke
Where is this King
Sirs stand you all without
No let's come in
I pray you give me leave
We will we will
I thank you
Keep the door
O thou vile king Give me my father
Calmly good Laertes
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard Cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows Of my true mother
What is the cause Laertes That thy rebellion looks so giant like
There's such divinity doth hedge a king That treason can but peep to what it would Acts little of his will
Tell me Laertes Why thou art thus incensed
Let him go Gertrude
Speak man
Where is my father
Dead
But not by him
How came he dead
Vows to the blackest devil
Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
I dare damnation
Who shall stay you
My will not all the world
And for my means I'll husband them so well They shall go far with little
Good Laertes If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father's death is't writ in your revenge That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe Winner and loser
None but his enemies
Will you know them then
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms And like the kind life rendering pelican Repast them with my blood
Why now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman
That I am guiltless of your father's death And am most sensibly in grief for it It shall as level to your judgment pierce As day does to your eye
Let her come in
How now
What noise is that
O heat dry up my brains
Tears seven times salt Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia
O heavens
is't possible a young maid's wits Should be as mortal as an old man's life
Nature is fine in love and where 'tis fine It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves
They bore him barefac'd on the bier (Hey non nony nony hey nony) And on his grave rain'd many a tear
Fare you well my dove
Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge It could not move thus
It is the false stew  ard that stole his master's daughter
This nothing's more than matter
There's fennel for you and columbines
There's rue for you and here's some for me
There's a daisy
I would give you some violets but they with  er'd all when my father died
And will he not come again
And will he not come again
No no he is dead Go to thy deathbed He never will come again
His beard was as white as snow All flaxen was his poll
He is gone he is gone And we cast away moan
God 'a'mercy on his soul
And of all Christian souls I pray God
God be wi' you
Do you see this O God
Laertes I must commune with your grief Or you deny me right
Go but apart Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me
If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touch'd we will our kingdom give Our crown our life and all that we call ours To you in satisfaction but if not Be you content to lend your patience to us And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content
His means of death his obscure burial  No trophy sword nor hatchment o'er his bones No noble rite nor formal ostentation Cry to be heard as 'twere from heaven to earth That I must call't in question
So you shall And where the offence is let the great axe fall
I pray you go with me
What are they that would speak with me
Seafaring men sir
They say they have letters for you
Let them come in
I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted if not from Lord Hamlet
God bless you sir
Let him bless thee too
He shall sir an't please him
Horatio when thou shalt have overlook'd this give these fellows some means to the King
They have letters for him
Ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase
Finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on a compelled valour and in the grapple I boarded them
On the instant they got clear of our ship so I alone became their prisoner
Let the King have the letters I have sent and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death
I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter
These good fellows will bring thee where I am
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England
Of them I have much to tell thee
Farewell
He that thou knowest thine Hamlet
Come I will give you way for these your letters And do't the speedier that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them
Now must your conscience my acquittance seal And you must put me in your heart for friend Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life
It well appears
But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats So crimeful and so capital in nature As by your safety wisdom all things else You mainly were stirr'd up
O for two special reasons Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew'd But yet to me they are strong
The Queen his mother Lives almost by his looks and for myself  My virtue or my plague be it either which  She's so conjunctive to my life and soul That as the star moves not but in his sphere I could not but by her
The other motive Why to a public count I might not go Is the great love the general gender bear him Who dipping all his faults in their affection Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone Convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind Would have reverted to my bow again And not where I had aim'd them
And so have I a noble father lost A sister driven into desperate terms Whose worth if praises may go back again Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections
But my revenge will come
Break not your sleeps for that
You must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime
You shortly shall hear more
What news
Letters my lord from Hamlet
This to your Majesty this to the Queen
From Hamlet
Who brought them
Sailors my lord they say I saw them not
Laertes you shall hear them
Leave us
High and mighty you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom
What should this mean
Are all the rest come back
Or is it some abuse and no such thing
Know you the hand
tis Hamlet's character
I'm lost in it my lord
But let him come
how otherwise  Will you be ruled by me
Ay my lord So you will not o'errule me to a peace
To thine own peace
It falls right
You have been talk'd of since your travel much And that in Hamlet's hearing for a quality Wherein they say you shine
Your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one and that in my regard Of the unworthiest siege
What part is that my lord
A very ribbon in the cap of youth Yet needful too for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds Importing health and graveness
Two months since Here was a gentleman of Normandy  I have seen myself and served against the French And they can well on horseback but this gallant Had witchcraft in't
He grew unto his seat And to such wondrous doing brought his horse As had he been incorpsed and demi natured With the brave beast
So far he topp'd my thought That I in forgery of shapes and tricks Come short of what he did
A Norman was't
A Norman
Upon my life Lamord
The very same
I know him well
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation
Sir this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er to play with you
Laertes was your father dear to you
Not that I think you did not love your father But that I know love is begun by time And that I see in passages of proof Time qualifies the spark and fire of it
There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it And nothing is at a like goodness still For goodness growing to a pleurisy Dies in his own too much
That we would do We should do when we would for this 'would' changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues are hands are accidents And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh That hurts by easing
But to the quick o' the ulcer
Hamlet comes back
What would you undertake To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words
To cut his throat i' the church
No place indeed should murder sanctuarize Revenge should have no bounds
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together And wager on your heads
He being remiss Most generous and free from all contriving Will not peruse the foils so that with ease Or with a little shuffling you may choose A sword unbated and in a pass of practice Requite him for your father
I will do't
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword
I bought an unction of a mountebank So mortal that but dip a knife in it Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon can save the thing from death This is but scratch'd withal
I'll touch my point With this contagion that if I gall him slightly It may be death
Therefore this project Should have a back or second that might hold If this did blast in proof
Soft
let me see
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings  I ha't
When in your motion you are hot and dry  As make your bouts more violent to that end  And that he calls for drink I'll have prepared him A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck Our purpose may hold there
How now sweet Queen
One woe doth tread upon another's heel So fast they follow
Your sister's drown'd Laertes
Drown'd
O where
Alas then she is drown'd
Drown'd drown'd
Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia And therefore I forbid my tears but yet It is our trick nature her custom holds Let shame say what it will
When these are gone The woman will be out
Adieu my lord
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze But that this folly drowns it
Let's follow Gertrude
How much I had to do to calm his rage
Now fear I this will give it start again Therefore let's follow
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation
I tell thee she is therefore make her grave straight
The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial
How can that be unless she drown'd herself in her own defence
Why 'tis found so
It must be se offendendo it cannot be else
For se offendendo it cannot be else
Here lies the water good
Here stands the man good
But is this law
Ay marry is't crowner's quest law
Will you ha' the truth on't
If this had not been a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o' Christian burial
Why there thou say'st
And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian
Come my spade
There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners ditchers and grave makers
They hold up Adam's profession
Was he a gentleman
A was the first that ever bore arms
Why he had none
What art a heathen
How dost thou under  stand the Scripture
The Scripture says Adam digged
Could he dig without arms
I'll put another question to thee
The gallows maker for that frame outlives a thousand tenants
I like thy wit well in good faith
To't again come
Who builds stronger than a mason a ship  wright or a carpenter
Ay tell me that and unyoke
Marry now I can tell
To't
Mass I cannot tell
Go get thee in Yaughan fetch me a stoup of liquor
In youth when I did love did love Methought it was very sweet To contract O the time for a my behove O methought there a was nothing a meet
Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at grave making
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness
tis e'en so
The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense
But age with his stealing steps Hath clawed me in his clutch And hath shipped me intil the land As if I had never been such
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
How the knave jowls it to the ground as if 'were Cain's jawbone that did the first murder
This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o'erreaches one that would circumvent God might it not
It might my lord
Or of a courtier which could say 'Good morrow sweet lord
How dost thou sweet lord
This might be my Lord Such a  one that praised my Lord Such a one's horse when he meant to beg it might it not
Ay my lord
Why e'en so
and now my Lady Worm's chapless and knock'd about the mazard with a sexton's spade
Here's fine revolution and we had the trick to see't
Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with 'em
Mine ache to think on't
A pickaxe and a spade a spade For and a shrouding sheet O a Pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet
There's another
Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer
Where be his quiddities now his quillets his cases his tenures and his tricks
Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of his action of battery
Hum
This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his fines his double vouchers his recoveries
Is this the fine of his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine pate full of fine dirt
Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures
The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha
Not a jot more my lord
Is not parchment made of sheepskins
Ay my lord And of calveskins too
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that
I will speak to this fellow
Whose grave's this sir  rah
Mine sir
O a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet
I think it be thine indeed for thou liest in't
You lie out on't sir and therefore 'tis not yours
For my part I do not lie in't yet it is mine
Thou dost lie in't to be in't and say it' 'tis thine
tis for the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest
tis a quick lie sir 'twill away again from me to you
What man dost thou dig it for
For no man sir
What woman then
For none neither
Who is to be buried in't
One that was a woman sir but rest her soul she's dead
How absolute the knave is
We must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us
By the Lord Horatio this three years I have taken note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe
How long hast thou been a grave maker
Of all the days i' the year I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras
How long is that since
Cannot you tell that
Every fool can tell that
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born he that is mad and sent into England
Ay marry why was he sent into England
A shall recover his wits there or if a do not 'tis no great matter there
Why
Twill not he seen in him there
There the men are as mad as he
How came he mad
Very strangely they say
How 'strangely'
Faith e'en with losing his wits
Upon what ground
Why here in Denmark
I have been sexton here man and boy thirty years
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot
I' faith if he be not rotten before he die as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in he will last you some eight year or nine year
A tanner will last you nine year
Why he more than another
Why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that a will keep out water a great while and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body
Here's a skull now
This skull hath lain in the earth three and twenty years
Whose was it
A whoreson mad fellow's it was
Whose do you think it was
Nay I know not
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue
A poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once
This same skull sir was Yorick's skull the King's jester
This
E'en that
Alas poor Yorick
I knew him Horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy
My gorge rises at it
Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft
Where be your gibes now
your gambols
your songs
your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar
Not one now to mock your own grinning
Quite chop fallen
Prithee Horatio tell me one thing
What's that my lord
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth
Pah
E'en so my lord
To what base uses we may return Horatio
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung hole
Twere to consider too curiously to consider so
Imperious Caesar dead and turn'd to clay Might stop a hole to keep the wind away
O that that earth which kept the world in awe Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw
But soft
Who is this they follow
And with such maimed rites
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo it own life
Twas of some estate
Couch we awhile and mark
What ceremony else
That is Laertes a very noble youth
Mark
What ceremony else
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warranty
Must there no more be done
Lay her i' the earth And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring
I tell thee churlish priest A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling
What the fair Ophelia
Sweets to the sweet
Farewell
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife I thought thy bride bed to have deck'd sweet maid And not have strew'd thy grave
O treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of
Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead Till of this flat a mountain you have made To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head Of blue Olympus
This is I Hamlet the Dane
The devil take thy soul
Thou pray'st not well
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat For though I am not splenitive and rash Yet have I in me something dangerous Which let thy wisdom fear
Hold off thy hand
Pluck them asunder
Gentlemen
Good my lord be quiet
Why I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag
O my son what theme
I loved Ophelia
Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum
What wilt thou do for her
O he is mad Laertes
For love of God forbear him
Swounds show me what thou'lt do
I'll do't
Be buried quick with her and so will I
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us till our ground Singeing his pate against the burning zone Make Ossa like a wart
Nay an thou'lt mouth I'll rant as well as thou
Anon as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed His silence will sit drooping
I loved you ever
But it is no matter
Let Hercules himself do what he may The cat will mew and dog will have his day
We'll put the matter to the present push  Good Gertrude set some watch over your son
This grave shall have a living monument
So much for this sir now shall you see the other
You do remember all the circumstance
Remember it my lord
Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes
such bugs and goblins in my life That on the supervise no leisure bated No not to stay the grinding of the axe My head should be struck off
Is't possible
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed
I beseech you
Being thus benetted round with villainies  Or I could make a prologue to my brains They had begun the play I sat me down Devised a new commission wrote it fair
I once did hold it as our statists do A baseness to write fair and labour'd much How to forget that learning but sir now It did me yeoman's service
Wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote
Ay good my lord
An earnest conjuration from the King As England was his faithful tributary As love between them like the palm might flourish As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma 'tween their amities And many such like as's of great charge That on the view and knowing of these contents Without debatement further more or less He should the bearers put to sudden death Not shriving time allow'd
How was this seal'd
Why even in that was heaven ordinant
Now the next day Was our sea fight and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't
Why man they did make love to this employment
They are not near my conscience their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow
tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites
Why what a king is this
Does it not think thee stand me now upon  He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother Popp'd in between the election and my hopes Thrown out his angle for my proper life And with such cozenage is't not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm
And is't not to be damn'd To let this canker of our nature come In further evil
It will be short the interim is mine And a man's life's is no more than to say 'One
But I am very sorry good Horatio That to Laertes I forgot myself For by the image of my cause I see The portraiture of his
I'll court his favours
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion
Peace who comes here
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark
I humbly thank you sir
Dost know this water fly
No my good lord
Thy state is the more gracious for 'tis a vice to know him
He hath much land and fertile
Let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the king's mess
tis a chough but as I say spacious in the pos  session of dirt
Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty
I will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit
Put your bonnet to his right use
tis for the head
I thank your lordship it is very hot
No believe me 'tis very cold the wind is northerly
It is indifferent cold my lord indeed
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion
Exceedingly my lord it is very sultry as 'twere I can  not tell how
But my lord his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head
Sir here is newly come to court Laertes believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft society and great showing
Indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gen  tleman would see
Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail
But in the verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage nothing more
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
The concernancy sir
Why do we wrap the gen  tleman in our more rawer breath
Sir
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue
You will to't sir really
What imports the nomination of this gentleman
Of Laertes
Of him sir
Well sir
I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his meed he's unfellowed
What's his weapon
Rapier and dagger
That's two of his weapons
But well
What call you the carriages
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done
The carriages sir are the hangers
The phrase would be more German to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides
I would it might be hangers till then
But on
Why is this 'impawned' as you call it
How if I answer no
I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
Sir I will walk here in the hall
If it please his Majesty it is the breathing time of day with me
Shall I redeliver you e'en so
To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
I commend my duty to your lordship
Yours yours
He does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else for's turn
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
He did comply with his dug before he sucked it
Thus has he and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out
My lord his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time
I am constant to my purposes they follow the King's pleasure
If his fitness speaks mine is ready now or when  soever provided I be so able as now
The King and Queen and all are coming down
In happy time
The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play
She well instructs me
You will lose this wager my lord
I do not think so
Since he went into France I have been in continual practice
I shall win at the odds
But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart
But it is no matter
Nay good my lord  It is but foolery but it is such a kind of gain giving as would perhaps trouble a woman
If your mind dislike anything obey it
The readiness is all
Since no man has aught of what he leaves what is't to leave betimes
Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me
Give me your pardon sir
This presence knows And you must needs have heard how I am punish'd With sore distraction
What I have done That might your nature honour and exception Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes
Never Hamlet
Who does it then
His madness
Sir in this audience Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts That I have shot my arrow o'er the house And hurt my brother
I am satisfied in nature Whose motive in this case should stir me most To my revenge
But in my terms of honour I stand aloof and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters of known honour I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungor'd
But till that time I do receive your offer'd love like love And will not wrong it
I embrace it freely And will this brother's wager frankly play  Give us the foils
Come on
Come one for me
I'll be your foil Laertes
In mine ignorance Your skill shall like a star i' the darkest night Stick fiery off indeed
You mock me sir
No by this hand
Give them the foils young Osric
Cousin Hamlet You know the wager
I do not fear it I have seen you both But since he is better'd we have therefore odds
This likes me well
These foils have all a length
Ay my good lord
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table
If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange Let all the battlements their ordnance fire The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn
Give me the cups And let the kettle to the trumpet speak The trumpet to the cannoneer without The cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth ‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet’ Come begin
And you the judges bear a wary eye
Come on sir
Come my lord
One
No
Judgment
A hit a very palpable hit
Well again
Stay give me drink
Hamlet this pearl is thine Here's to thy health
Give him the cup
I'll play this bout first set it by awhile
Come
A touch a touch I do confess
Our son shall win
He's fat and scant of breath
The Queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet
Good madam
Gertrude do not drink
I will my lord I pray you pardon me
It is the poison'd cup it is too late
I dare not drink yet madam by and by
Come let me wipe thy face
My lord I'll hit him now
I do not think't
And yet it is almost against my conscience
Come for the third Laertes
Say you so
Come on
Nothing neither way
Have at you now
Part them
They are incensed
Look to the Queen there ho
They bleed on both sides
How is it my lord
How is't Laertes
Why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery
How does the Queen
She swoons to see them bleed
No no
I am poison'd
O villainy
Ho
let the door be lock'd
Treachery
Seek it out
It is here Hamlet
Hamlet thou art slain No medicine in the world can do thee good
The foul practice Hath turn'd itself on me
Lo here I lie Never to rise again
Thy mother's poison'd
I can no more
The King the King's to blame
The point envenom'd too
Then venom to thy work
Treason
treason
O yet defend me friends
I am but hurt
Here thou incestuous murderous damned Dane Drink off this potion
Is thy union here
Follow my mother
Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee Nor thine on me
Heaven make thee free of it
I follow thee
I am dead Horatio
Wretched Queen adieu
Never believe it
I am more an antique Romanthan a Dane
Here's yet some liquor left
O God Horatio what a wounded name Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity awhile And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story
What warlike noise is this
Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley
I cannot live to hear the news from England But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras
Now cracks a noble heart
Good night sweet prince And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
Why does the drum come hither
Where is this sight
What is it you will see
If aught of woe or wonder cease your search
This quarry cries on havoc
O proud Death What feast is toward in thine eternal cell That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck
The sight is dismal And our affairs from England come too late
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
Where should we have our thanks
Not from his mouth Had it the ability of life to thank you
He never gave commandment for their death
But since so jump upon this bloody question You from the Polack wars and you from England Are here arrived give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about
So shall you hear Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts Of accidental judgments casual slaughters Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause And in this upshot purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventors' heads
All this can I Truly deliver
Let us haste to hear it And call the noblest to the audience
For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
Of that I shall have also cause to speak And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
But let this same be presently perform'd Even while men's minds are wild lest more mischance On plots and errors happen
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage For he was likely had he been put on To have proved most royal and for his passage The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him
Take up the bodies
Hence
home you idle creatures get you home
Why sir a carpenter
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule
Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but as you would say a cobbler
But what trade art thou
Answer me directly
A trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe con  science which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
What trade thou knave
Thou naughty knave what trade
Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir I can mend you
What mean'st thou by that
Mend me thou saucy  fellow
Why sir cobble you
Thou art a cobbler art thou
Truly Sir all that I live by is with the awl I meddle with no tradesman's matters nor women's matters but with awl
I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger I recover them
As proper men as ever trod upon neats leather have gone upon my handiwork
But wherefore art not in thy shop today
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets
Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work
But indeed sir we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
Wherefore rejoice
What conquest brings he home
What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome Knew you not Pompey
Many a time and oft Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements To towers and windows yea to chimney tops Your infants in your arms and there have sat The live long day with patient expectation To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
And when you saw his chariot but appear Have you not made an universal shout That Tiber trembled underneath her banks To hear the replication of your sounds Made in her concave shores
And do you now put on your best attire
And do you now cull out a holiday
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood
Be gone
Run to your houses fall upon your knees Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude
Go go good countrymen and for this fault Assemble all the poor men of your sort Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all
See whether their basest metal be not moved They vanish tongue tied in their guiltiness
Go you down that way towards the Capitol This way will I Disrobe the images If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies
May we do so
You know it is the feast of Lupercal
It is no matter let no images Be hung with Caesar's trophies
I'll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets So do you too where you perceive them thick
Caesar speaks
Stand you directly in Antonio's way When he doth run his course
I shall remember
When Caesar says “Do this” it is perform'd
Set on and leave no ceremony out
Caesar
Ha
Who calls
Peace yet again
Who is it in the press that calls on me
I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry “Caesar” Speak Caesar is turn'd to hear
Beware the ides of March
What man is that
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March
Set him before me let me see his face
Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar
What say'st thou to me now
Speak once again
Beware the ides of March
He is a dreamer let us leave him
Pass
Will you go see the order of the course
I am not gamesome I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony
Let me not hinder Cassius your desires I'll leave you
Brutus I do observe you now of late I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you
Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference Conceptions only proper to myself Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors But let not therefore my good friends be grieved  Among which number Cassius be you one  Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus with himself at war Forgets the shows of love to other men
Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
No Cassius for the eye sees not itself But by reflection by some other things
Tis just And it is very much lamented Brutus That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow
I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age's yoke Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes
Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me
Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of
And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus Were I a common laugher or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout then hold me dangerous
What means this shouting
I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king
Ay do you fear it
Then must I think you would not have it so
What is it that you would impart to me
I know that virtue to be in you Brutus As well as I do know your outward favor
Well honor is the subject of my story
I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life but for my single self I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself
So indeed he did
And this man Is now become a god and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him
He had a fever when he was in Spain And when the fit was on him I did mark How he did shake
I did hear him groan
Another general shout
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar
Why man he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves
Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar
Why should that name be sounded more than yours
Write them together yours is as fair a name Sound them it doth become the mouth as well Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar
Now in the names of all the gods at once Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great
Age thou art shamed
Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
When went there by an age since the great flood But it was famed with more than with one man
When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome That her wide walls encompass'd but one man
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough When there is in it but one only man
O you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king
That you do love me I am nothing jealous What you would work me to I have some aim
How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter for this present I would not so with love I might entreat you Be any further moved
What you have said I will consider what you have to say I will with patience hear and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus
The games are done and Caesar is returning
As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve And he will after his sour fashion tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today
But look you Cassius The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow And all the rest look like a chidden train Calpurnia's cheek is pale and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being cross'd in conference by some senators
Casca will tell us what the matter is
Caesar
Fear him not Caesar he's not dangerous He is a noble Roman and well given
Would he were fatter
He reads much He is a great observer and he looks Quite through the deeds of men
Such men as he be never at heart's ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves And therefore are they very dangerous
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd Than what I fear for always I am Caesar
Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf And tell me truly what thou think'st of him
You pull'd me by the cloak would you speak with me
Ay Casca tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad
Why you were with him were you not
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced
Why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell a shouting
What was the second noise for
Why for that too
They shouted thrice
What was the last cry for
Why for that too
Was the crown offered him thrice
Ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted
Who offered him the crown
Why Antony
Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca
I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it
It was mere foolery I did not mark it
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown yet 'twas not a crown neither 'twas one of these coronets and as I told you he put it by once
But for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it
But to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it
And then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar for he swounded and fell down at it
And for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air
What did Caesar swound
He fell down in the market place and foamed at mouth and was speechless
No Caesar hath it not but you and I And honest Casca we have the falling sickness
I know not what you mean by that but I am sure Caesar fell down
If the tag rag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre I am no true man
What said he when he came unto himself
Marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut
When he came to himself again he said if he had done or said any thing amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity
But there's no heed to be taken of them if Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less
And after that he came thus sad away
Ay
Did Cicero say anything
Ay he spoke Greek
To what effect
Fare you well
There was more foolery yet if could remember it
Will you sup with me tonight Casca
No I am promised forth
Will you dine with me tomorrow
Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating
Good I will expect you
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be
He was quick mettle when he went to school
So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise However he puts on this tardy form
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite
And so it is
For this time I will leave you
Tomorrow if you please to speak with me I will come home to you or if you will Come home to me and I will wait for you
I will do so
I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw As if they came from several citizens Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at
And after this let Caesar seat him sure For we will shake him or worse days endure
Good even Casca
Brought you Caesar home
Why are you breathless and why stare you so
Are not you moved when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm
Either there is a civil strife in heaven Or else the world too saucy with the gods Incenses them to send destruction
Why saw you anything more wonderful
A common slave you know him well by sight  Held up his left hand which did flame and burn Like twenty torches join'd and yet his hand Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd
Besides I ha' not since put up my sword  Against the Capitol I met a lion Who glazed upon me and went surly by Without annoying me and there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women Transformed with their fear who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets
And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon day upon the market place Howling and shrieking
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet let not men say “These are their reasons they are natural” For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon
Indeed it is a strange disposed time But men may construe things after their fashion Clean from the purpose of the things themselves
Come Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow
He doth for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow
Good then Casca
This disturbed sky Is not to walk in
Farewell Cicero
Who's there
A Roman
Casca by your voice
Your ear is good
Cassius what night is this
A very pleasing night to honest men
Who ever knew the heavens menace so
Those that have known the earth so full of faults
For my part I have walk'd about the streets Submitting me unto the perilous night And thus unbraced Casca as you see Have bared my bosom to the thunder stone And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open The breast of heaven I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us
You are dull Casca and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want Or else you use not
You look pale and gaze And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens
But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts Why birds and beasts from quality and kind Why old men fool and children calculate Why all these things change from their ordinance Their natures and preformed faculties To monstrous quality why you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state
Now could I Casca name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night That thunders lightens opens graves and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action yet prodigious grown And fearful as these strange eruptions are
Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius
Our fathers' minds are dead And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
Indeed they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy
Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit But life being weary of these worldly bars Never lacks power to dismiss itself
If I know this know all the world besides That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure
So can I
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then
Poor man
I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
He were no lion were not Romans hinds
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws
What trash is Rome What rubbish and what offal when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar
But O grief Where hast thou led me
I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman then I know My answer must be made
Hold my hand
Be factious for redress of all these griefs And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest
There's a bargain made
Now know you Casca I have moved already Some certain of the noblest minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable dangerous consequence And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey's Porch
For now this fearful night There is no stir or walking in the streets And the complexion of the element In favor's like the work we have in hand Most bloody fiery and most terrible
Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
To find out you
Who's that
Metellus Cimber
No it is Casca one incorporate To our attempts
Am I not stay'd for Cinna
I am glad on't
What a fearful night is this
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights
Am I not stay'd for
Tell me
Yes you are
O Cassius if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party  Be you content
All this done Repair to Pompey's porch where you shall find us
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
All but Metellus Cimber and he's gone To seek you at your house
Well I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade me
Three parts of him Is ours already and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him ours
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited
Let us go For it is after midnight and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him
awake I say
what Lucius
Call'd you my lord
Get me a taper in my study Lucius
When it is lighted come and call me here
I will my lord
It must be by his death and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking
Crown him
that And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar I have not known when his affections sway'd More than his reason
The taper burneth in your closet sir
Searching the window for a flint I found This paper thus seal'd up and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed
Get you to bed again it is not day
Is not tomorrow boy the ides of March
I know not sir
Look in the calendar and bring me word
I will sir
The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them
Brutus thou sleep'st awake and see thyself
Shall Rome &ampc Speak strike redress” “Brutus thou sleep'st awake” Such instigations have been often dropp'd Where I have took them up
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe
What Rome
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive when he was call'd a king
Speak strike redress” Am I entreated To speak and strike
O Rome I make thee promise If the redress will follow thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus
Sir March is wasted fifteen days
Tis good
Sir 'tis your brother Cassius at the door Who doth desire to see you
Is he alone
No sir there are moe with him
Do you know them
No sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears And half their faces buried in their cloaks That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor
O Conspiracy Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free
O then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage
Seek none conspiracy Hide it in smiles and affability For if thou path thy native semblance on Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention
I think we are too bold upon your rest
Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you
Know I these men that come along with you
Yes every man of them and no man here But honors you and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you
This is Trebonius
He is welcome hither
This Decius Brutus
He is welcome too
This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber
They are all welcome
Shall I entreat a word
Here lies the east
Doth not the day break here
No
O pardon sir it doth and yon grey lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day
You shall confess that you are both deceived
Here as I point my sword the sun arises Which is a great way growing on the south Weighing the youthful season of the year
Some two months hence up higher toward the north He first presents his fire and the high east Stands as the Capitol directly here
Give me your hands all over one by one
And let us swear our resolution
No not an oath
If not the face of men The sufferance of our souls the time's abuse  If these be motives weak break off betimes And every man hence to his idle bed So let high sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery
But if these As I am sure they do bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women then countrymen What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged That this shall be or we will fall for it
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath when every drop of blood That every Roman bears and nobly bears Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath pass'd from him
But what of Cicero
Shall we sound him
I think he will stand very strong with us
Let us not leave him out
No by no means
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear But all be buried in his gravity
Then leave him out
Indeed he is not fit
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar
Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius To cut the head off and then hack the limbs Like wrath in death and envy afterwards For Antony is but a limb of Caesar
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar And in the spirit of men there is no blood
O that we then could come by Caesar's spirit And not dismember Caesar
But alas Caesar must bleed for it
This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious Which so appearing to the common eyes We shall be call'd purgers not murderers
And for Mark Antony think not of him For he can do no more than Caesar's arm When Caesar's head is off
Yet I fear him For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar  Alas good Cassius do not think of him
If he love Caesar all that he can do Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar
And that were much he should for he is given To sports to wildness and much company
The clock hath stricken three
Tis time to part
But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no For he is superstitious grown of late Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
It may be these apparent prodigies The unaccustom'd terror of this night And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today
Never fear that
Let me work For I can give his humor the true bent And I will bring him to the Capitol
Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
By the eighth hour
Is that the uttermost
Be that the uttermost and fail not then
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
I wonder none of you have thought of him
Now good Metellus go along by him
He loves me well and I have given him reasons Send him but hither and I'll fashion him
The morning comes upon's
We'll leave you Brutus And friends disperse yourselves but all remember What you have said and show yourselves true Romans
Fast asleep
Enjoy the honey heavy dew of slumber Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men Therefore thou sleep'st so sound
Brutus my lord
Portia what mean you
Wherefore rise you now
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morning
Nor for yours neither
I urged you further then you scratch'd your head And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot
Yet I insisted yet you answer'd not But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you
So I did Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem'd too much enkindled and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humor Which sometime hath his hour with every man
It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevail'd on your condition I should not know you Brutus
Dear my lord Make me acquainted with your cause of grief
I am not well in health and that is all
Brutus is wise and were he not in health He would embrace the means to come by it
Why so I do
Good Portia go to bed
What is Brutus sick And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness
No my Brutus You have some sick offense within your mind Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of and upon my knees I charm you by my once commended beauty By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one That you unfold to me yourself your half Why you are heavy and what men tonight Have had resort to you for here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darkness
Kneel not gentle Portia
I should not need if you were gentle Brutus
Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you
Am I yourself But as it were in sort or limitation To keep with you at meals comfort your bed And talk to you sometimes
Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure
If it be no more Portia is Brutus' harlot not his wife
You are my true and honorable wife As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart
If this were true then should I know this secret
I grant I am a woman but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
I grant I am a woman but withal A woman well reputed Cato's daughter
Think you I am no stronger than my sex Being so father'd and so husbanded
Tell me your counsels I will not disclose em
I have made strong proof of my constancy Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh
Can I bear that with patience And not my husband's secrets
O ye gods Render me worthy of this noble wife
Hark hark one knocks
Portia go in awhile And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart
All my engagements I will construe to thee All the charactery of my sad brows
Leave me with haste
Lucius who's that knocks
Here is a sick man that would speak with you
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor
Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius Had you a healthful ear to hear of it
By all the gods that Romans bow before I here discard my sickness
Soul of Rome
Brave son derived from honorable loins
Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up My mortified spirit
Now bid me run And I will strive with things impossible Yea get the better of them
What's to do
A piece of work that will make sick men whole
But are not some whole that we must make sick
That must we also
What it is my Caius I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done
Set on your foot And with a heart new fired I follow you To do I know not what but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on
Follow me then
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out “Help ho
My lord
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success
I will my lord
What mean you Caesar
Think you to walk forth
You shall not stir out of your house today
Caesar I never stood on ceremonies Yet now they fright me
There is one within Besides the things that we have heard and seen Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
A lioness hath whelped in the streets And graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol The noise of battle hurtled in the air Horses did neigh and dying men did groan And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar
Cowards die many times before their deaths The valiant never taste of death but once
They would not have you to stir forth today
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth They could not find a heart within the beast
The gods do this in shame of cowardice
Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear
No Caesar shall not
Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he
Alas my lord Your wisdom is consumed in confidence
Do not go forth today
Let me upon my knee prevail in this
Mark Antony shall say I am not well And for thy humor I will stay at home
Here's Decius Brutus he shall tell them so
Caesar all hail
Good morrow worthy Caesar
I come to fetch you to the Senate house
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today
Tell them so Decius
Say he is sick
Shall Caesar send a lie
Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so
But for your private satisfaction Because I love you I will let you know
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent and on her knee Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes 90 In which so many smiling Romans bathed Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood and that great men shall press For tinctures stains relics and cognizance
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified
And this way have you well expounded it
I have when you have heard what I can say
And know it now the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar
If you shall send them word you will not come Their minds may change
Besides it were a mock Apt to be render'd for some one to say “Break up the Senate till another time When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams” If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper “Lo Caesar is afraid”
Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this And reason to my love is liable
How foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia
I am ashamed I did yield to them
Give me my robe for I will go
And look where Publius is come to fetch me
Good morrow Caesar
Caesar 'tis strucken eight
I thank you for your pains and courtesy
Bid them prepare within
I am to blame to be thus waited for
Now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius I have an hour's talk in store for you Remember that you call on me today Be near me that I may remember you
Caesar I will
And so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further
Good friends go in and taste some wine with me And we like friends will straightway go together
That every like is not the same O Caesar The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon
Caesar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius come not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not Trebonius mark it well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus loves thee not thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius
There is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against Caesar
If thou beest not immortal look about you
Security gives way to conspiracy
The mighty gods defend thee
I prithee boy run to the Senate house Stay not to answer me but get thee gone
Why dost thou stay
To know my errand madam
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue
I have a man's mind but a woman's might
Madam what should I do
Run to the Capitol and nothing else
And so return to you and nothing else
I hear none madam
Prithee listen well
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray And the wind brings it from the Capitol
Sooth madam I hear nothing
At mine own house good lady
What is't o'clock
About the ninth hour lady
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol
Madam not yet
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol
Thou hast some suit to Caesar hast thou not
That I have lady
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me I shall beseech him to befriend himself
Why know'st thou any harm's intended towards him
None that I know will be much that I fear may chance
Good morrow to you
Here the street is narrow The throng that follows Caesar at the heels Of senators of praetors common suitors Will crowd a feeble man almost to death
I'll get me to a place more void and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along
Come to me again And bring me word what he doth say to thee
The ides of March are come
Ay Caesar but not gone
Hail Caesar
Read this schedule
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read At your best leisure this his humble suit
O Caesar read mine first for mine's a suit That touches Caesar nearer
Read it great Caesar
What touches us ourself shall be last served
Delay not Caesar read it instantly
What is the fellow mad
Sirrah give place
What urge you your petitions in the street
Come to the Capitol
I wish your enterprise today may thrive
What enterprise Popilius
Fare you well
What said Popilius Lena
He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive
I fear our purpose is discovered
Look how he makes to Caesar
Mark him
If this be known Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back For I will slay myself
Cassius be constant
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes For look he smiles and Caesar doth not change
Trebonius knows his time for look you Brutus He draws Mark Antony out of the way
Where is Metellus Cimber
Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar
He is address'd press near and second him
Casca you are the first that rears your hand
Are we all ready
What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress
Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart
I must prevent thee Cimber
These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children
Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thaw'd from the true quality With that which melteth fools I mean sweet words Low crooked court'sies and base spaniel fawning
Thy brother by decree is banished
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him I spurn thee like a cur out of my way
Know Caesar doth not wrong nor without cause Will he be satisfied
Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear For the repealing of my banish'd brother
What Brutus
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber
Speak hands for me
Then fall Caesar
Liberty
Freedom
Go to the pulpit Brutus
And Cassius too
Where's Publius
Here quite confounded with this mutiny
Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesar's Should chance  Talk not of standing
Publius good cheer There is no harm intended to your person Nor to no Roman else
So tell them Publius
And leave us Publius lest that the people Rushing on us should do your age some mischief
Do so and let no man abide this deed But we the doers
Where is Antony
Fled to his house amazed
Men wives and children stare cry out and run As it were doomsday
Fates we will know your pleasures
That we shall die we know 'tis but the time And drawing days out that men stand upon
Why he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death
Grant that and then is death a benefit So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged His time of fearing death
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport That now on Pompey's basis lies along No worthier than the dust
So oft as that shall be So often shall the knot of us be call'd The men that gave their country liberty
What shall we forth
Ay every man away
Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome
Soft who comes here
A friend of Antony's
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith
So says my master Antony
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman I never thought him worse
Tell him so please him come unto this place He shall be satisfied and by my honor Depart untouch'd
I'll fetch him presently
I know that we shall have him well to friend
I wish we may but yet have I a mind That fears him much and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose
O mighty Caesar
Dost thou lie so low
Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils Shrunk to this little measure
If I myself there is no hour so fit As Caesar's death's hour nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world
I do beseech ye if you bear me hard Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke Fulfill your pleasure
O Antony beg not your death of us
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel As by our hands and this our present act You see we do yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done
Our hearts you see not they are pitiful And pity to the general wrong of Rome  As fire drives out fire so pity pity  Hath done this deed on Caesar
For your part To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers' temper do receive you in With all kind love good thoughts and reverence
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's In the disposing of new dignities
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude beside themselves with fear And then we will deliver you the cause Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him Have thus proceeded
I doubt not of your wisdom
Let each man render me his bloody hand
First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius
Gentlemen all alas what shall I say
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies
Pardon me Julius
Mark Antony  Pardon me Caius Cassius
The enemies of Caesar shall say this Then in a friend it is cold modesty
I blame you not for praising Caesar so But what compact mean you to have with us
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends Or shall we on and not depend on you
Therefore I took your hands but was indeed Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar
Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous
Or else were this a savage spectacle
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you Antony the son of Caesar You should be satisfied
You shall Mark Antony
Brutus a word with you
By your pardon I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar's death
What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
It shall advantage more than do us wrong
I know not what may fall I like it not
Mark Antony here take you Caesar's body
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do't by our permission Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral
And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going After my speech is ended
Be it so I do desire no more
Prepare the body then and follow us
O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
I do Mark Antony
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
Passion I see is catching for mine eyes Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine Began to water
Is thy master coming
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome No Rome of safety for Octavius yet Hie hence and tell him so
Yet stay awhile Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the market place
There shall I try In my oration how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things
Lend me your hand
I will hear Brutus speak
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them rendered
The noble Brutus is ascended
Silence
Be patient till the last
Romans countrymen and lovers
Hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear
Believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe
Censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge
If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesar's to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live all freemen
As Caesar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was valiant I honor him but as he was ambitious I slew him
There is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition
Who is here so base that would be a bondman
If any speak for him have I offended
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman
If any speak for him have I offended
Who is here so vile that will not love his country
If any speak for him have I offended
I pause for a reply
None Brutus none
Then none have I offended
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death
Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not
With this I depart that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death
Bring him with triumph home unto his house
Give him a statue with his ancestors
Let him be Caesar
Caesar's better parts Shall be crown'd in Brutus
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors
My countrymen  Peace
Silence
Brutus speaks
Peace ho
Good countrymen let me depart alone And for my sake stay here with Antony
Do grace to Caesar's corse and grace his speech Tending to Caesar's glories which Mark Antony By our permission is allow'd to make
I do entreat you not a man depart Save I alone till Antony have spoke
For Brutus' sake I am beholding to you
What does he say of Brutus
He says for Brutus' sake He finds himself beholding to us all
Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here
This Caesar was a tyrant
Nay that's certain
We are blest that Rome is rid of him
Peace
Let us hear what Antony can say
You gentle Romans  Peace ho
Let us hear him
Here under leave of Brutus and the rest  For Brutus is an honorable man So are they all all honorable men  Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral
He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honorable man
You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown Which he did thrice refuse
Was this ambition
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And sure he is an honorable man
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke But here I am to speak what I do know
You all did love him once not without cause What cause withholds you then to mourn for him
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings
If thou consider rightly of the matter Caesar has had great wrong
Has he masters
I fear there will a worse come in his place
Mark'd ye his words
He would not take the crown Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious
If it be found so some will dear abide it
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony
Now mark him he begins again to speak
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world
Now lies he there And none so poor to do him reverence
I will not do them wrong I rather choose To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you Than I will wrong such honorable men
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar I found it in his closet 'tis his will
Let but the commons hear this testament  Which pardon me I do not mean to read  And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood Yea beg a hair of him for memory And dying mention it within their wills Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue
We'll hear the will
Read it Mark Antony
The will the will
We will hear Caesar's will
Have patience gentle friends I must not read it It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you
You are not wood you are not stones but men And being men hearing the will of Caesar It will inflame you it will make you mad
Tis good you know not that you are his heirs For if you should O what would come of it
Read the will we'll hear it Antony
You shall read us the will Caesar's will
Will you be patient
Will you stay a while
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it
I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar I do fear it
They were traitors
The testament
They were villains murderers
The will
Read the will
You will compel me then to read the will
Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar And let me show you him that made the will
Shall I descend
And will you give me leave
You shall have leave
Stand from the hearse stand from the body
Room for Antony most noble Antony
Nay press not so upon me stand far off
If you have tears prepare to shed them now
You all do know this mantle
I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on 'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent That day he overcame the Nervii
Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
This was the most unkindest cut of all For when the noble Caesar saw him stab Ingratitude more strong than traitors' arms Quite vanquish'd him
Then burst his mighty heart And in his mantle muffling up his face Even at the base of Pompey's statue Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell
O now you weep and I perceive you feel The dint of pity
These are gracious drops
Kind souls what weep you when you but behold Our Caesar's vesture wounded
Look you here Here is himself marr'd as you see with traitors
O piteous spectacle
O noble Caesar
O woeful day
O traitors villains
O most bloody sight
Let not a traitor live
Stay countrymen
Peace there
Hear the noble Antony
We'll hear him we'll follow him we'll die with him
Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny
They that have done this deed are honorable
I come not friends to steal away your hearts
But were I Brutus And Brutus Antony there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny
We'll mutiny
We'll burn the house of Brutus
Away then
Come seek the conspirators
Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
Peace ho
Hear Antony most noble Antony
Why friends you go to do you know not what
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves
Alas you know not I must tell you then
You have forgot the will I told you of
Here is the will and under Caesar's seal
To every Roman citizen he gives To every several man seventy five drachmas
O royal Caesar
Hear me with patience
Peace ho
Here was a Caesar
When comes such another
We'll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors' houses
Take up the body
Go fetch fire
Pluck down benches
Pluck down forms windows any thing
Now let it work
Sir Octavius is already come to Rome
Where is he
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house
And thither will I straight to visit him
He comes upon a wish
Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us any thing
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome
Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them
Bring me to Octavius
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar And things unluckily charge my fantasy
I have no will to wander forth of doors Yet something leads me forth
What is your name
Whither are you going
Where do you dwell
Are you a married man or a bachelor
Answer every man directly
Ay and briefly
Ay and wisely
Ay and truly you were best
What is my name
Whither am I going
Where do I dwell
Am I a married man or a bachelor
Proceed directly
Directly I am going to Caesar's funeral
As a friend or an enemy
As a friend
That matter is answered directly
For your dwelling briefly
Briefly I dwell by the Capitol
Your name sir truly
Truly my name is Cinna
I am Cinna the poet I am Cinna the poet
Tear him for his bad verses tear him for his bad verses
I am not Cinna the conspirator
Tear him tear him
Come brands ho fire 
Some to Decius' house and some to Casca's some to Ligarius'
Away go
These many then shall die their names are prick'd
I do consent  Prick him down Antony
Upon condition Publius shall not live Who is your sister's son Mark Antony
He shall not live look with a spot I damn him
But Lepidus go you to Caesar's house Fetch the will hither and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies
What shall I find you here
Or here or at the Capitol
This is a slight unmeritable man Meet to be sent on errands
Is it fit The three fold world divided he should stand One of the three to share it
So you thought him And took his voice who should be prick'd to die In our black sentence and proscription
Octavius I have seen more days than you And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold To groan and sweat under the business Either led or driven as we point the way And having brought our treasure where we will Then take we down his load and turn him off Like to the empty ass to shake his ears And graze in commons
You may do your will But he's a tried and valiant soldier
So is my horse Octavius and for that I do appoint him store of provender
It is a creature that I teach to fight To wind to stop to run directly on His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit
Do not talk of him But as a property
And now Octavius Listen great things
Let us do so for we are at the stake And bay'd about with many enemies And some that smile have in their hearts I fear Millions of mischiefs
Stand ho
He is at hand and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master
Let me be resolved
With courtesy and with respect enough But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling
Ever note Lucilius When love begins to sicken and decay It useth an enforced ceremony
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith But hollow men like horses hot at hand Make gallant show and promise of their mettle But when they should endure the bloody spur They fall their crests and like deceitful jades Sink in the trial
Comes his army on
March gently on to meet him
Stand ho
Stand ho
Speak the word along
Stand
Stand
Stand
Most noble brother you have done me wrong
Judge me you gods
Wrong I mine enemies
And if not so how should I wrong a brother
Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs And when you do them  Cassius be content Speak your griefs softly I do know you well
Pindarus Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians Wherein my letters praying on his side Because I knew the man were slighted off
You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case
In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment
Let me tell you Cassius you yourself Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers
I an itching palm
You know that you are Brutus that speaks this Or by the gods this speech were else your last
The name of Cassius honors this corruption And chastisement doth therefore hide his head
Chastisement
Remember March the ides of March remember
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake
What shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasped thus
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman
Brutus bait not me I'll not endure it
Go to you are not Cassius
I am
I say you are not
Away slight man
Is't possible
Hear me for I will speak
Must I give way and room to your rash choler
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares
O gods ye gods
Must I endure all this
All this
Ay more
Must I bouge
Must I observe you
Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor
By the gods You shall digest the venom of your spleen Though it do split you for from this day forth I'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter When you are waspish
Is it come to this
For mine own part I shall be glad to learn of noble men
You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
I said an elder soldier not a better
Did I say “better”
If you did I care not
When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
Peace peace
You durst not so have tempted him
I durst not
No
What durst not tempt him
For your life you durst not
Do not presume too much upon my love I may do that I shall be sorry for
You have done that you should be sorry for
There is no terror Cassius in your threats For I am arm'd so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind Which I respect not
I did send to you For certain sums of gold which you denied me For I can raise no money by vile means
Was that done like Cassius
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts Dash him to pieces
I denied you not
You did
I did not
He was but a fool That brought my answer back
Brutus hath rived my heart
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities But Brutus makes mine greater than they are
I do not till you practise them on me
You love me not
I do not like your faults
A friendly eye could never see such faults
A flatterer's would not though they do appear As huge as high Olympus
Come Antony and young Octavius come Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius For Cassius is aweary of the world Hated by one he loves braved by his brother Check'd like a bondman all his faults observed Set in a notebook learn'd and conn'd by rote To cast into my teeth
Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius
Sheathe your dagger
Be angry when you will it shall have scope Do what you will dishonor shall be humor
O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire Who much enforced shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again
Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus When grief and blood ill temper'd vexeth him
When I spoke that I was ill temper'd too
Do you confess so much
Give me your hand
And my heart too
Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful
Yes Cassius and from henceforth When you are overearnest with your Brutus He'll think your mother chides and leave you so
Let me go in to see the generals
There is some grudge between 'em 'tis not meet They be alone
You shall not come to them
Nothing but death shall stay me
For shame you generals
What do you mean
Love and be friends as two such men should be For I have seen more years I'm sure than ye
Ha ha
How vilely doth this cynic rhyme
Get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence
Bear with him Brutus 'tis his fashion
I'll know his humor when he knows his time
Away away be gone
Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight
And come yourselves and bring Messala with you Immediately to us
Lucius a bowl of wine
I did not think you could have been so angry
O Cassius I am sick of many griefs
Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils
No man bears sorrow better
Portia is dead
Ha
Portia
She is dead
Impatient of my absence And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong for with her death That tidings came with this she fell distract And her attendants absent swallow'd fire
And died so
Even so
O ye immortal gods
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
Fill Lucius till the wine o'erswell the cup I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love
Portia art thou gone
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure
With what addition
That by proscription and bills of outlawry Octavius Antony and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators
Cicero one
No Messala
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her
Nothing Messala
That methinks is strange
Why ask you
Hear you ought of her in yours
No my lord
Now as you are a Roman tell me true
Why farewell Portia
We must die Messala
With meditating that she must die once I have the patience to endure it now
Even so great men great losses should endure
I have as much of this in art as you But yet my nature could not bear it so
Well to our work alive
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently
I do not think it good
Your reason
Good reasons must of force give place to better
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection For they have grudged us contribution
The enemy marching along by them By them shall make a fuller number up Come on refresh'd new added and encouraged From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there These people at our back
Hear me good brother
Under your pardon
There is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune Omitted all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries
On such a full sea are we now afloat And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures
The deep of night is crept upon our talk And nature must obey necessity Which we will niggard with a little rest
There is no more to say
No more
Good night
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence
O my dear brother
This was an ill beginning of the night
Never come such division 'tween our souls
Let it not Brutus
Good night good brother
Good night Lord Brutus
Where is thy instrument
Here in the tent
What thou speak'st drowsily
Poor knave I blame thee not thou art o'erwatch'd
Call Claudius and some other of my men I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent
Varro and Claudio
Calls my lord
I pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius
So please you we will stand and watch your pleasure
I was sure your lordship did not give it me
Bear with me good boy I am much forgetful
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes a while And touch thy instrument a strain or two
Ay my lord an't please you
It does my boy
I trouble thee too much but thou art willing
It is my duty sir
I should not urge thy duty past thy might I know young bloods look for a time of rest
I have slept my lord already
It was well done and thou shalt sleep again I will not hold thee long
If thou dost nod thou break'st thy instrument I'll take it from thee and good boy good night
Let me see let me see is not the leaf turn'd down Where I left reading
Here it is I think
How ill this taper burns
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition
Art thou some god some angel or some devil That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare
Speak to me what thou art
Thy evil spirit Brutus
Why comest thou
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi
Well then I shall see thee again
Ay at Philippi
Why I will see thee at Philippi then
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest
Varro
Claudius
The strings my lord are false
My lord
Didst thou dream Lucius that thou so criedst out
My lord I do not know that I did cry
Yes that thou didst
Didst thou see any thing
Nothing my lord
My lord
My lord
Why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep
Did we my lord
No my lord I saw nothing
Nor I my lord
It shall be done my lord
Now Antony our hopes are answered
You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions
It proves not so
Their battles are at hand They mean to warn us at Philippi here Answering before we do demand of them
Tut I am in their bosoms and I know Wherefore they do it
They could be content To visit other places and come down With fearful bravery thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage But 'tis not so
Prepare you generals
The enemy comes on in gallant show Their bloody sign of battle is hung out And something to be done immediately
Octavius lead your battle softly on Upon the left hand of the even field
Upon the right hand I keep thou the left
Why do you cross me in this exigent
I do not cross you but I will do so
They stand and would have parley
Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle
No Caesar we will answer on their charge
Make forth the generals would have some words
Stir not until the signal
Words before blows
Is it so countrymen
Not that we love words better as you do
Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart Crying “Long live
Not stingless too
O yes and soundless too For you have stol'n their buzzing Antony And very wisely threat before you sting
You show'd your teeth like apes and fawn'd like hounds And bow'd like bondmen kissing Caesar's feet Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind Struck Caesar on the neck
Come come the cause
If arguing make us sweat The proof of it will turn to redder drops
Never till Caesar's three and thirty wounds Be well avenged or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
Caesar thou canst not die by traitors' hands Unless thou bring'st them with thee
So I hope I was not born to die on Brutus' sword
O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain Young man thou couldst not die more honorable
A peevish school boy worthless of such honor Join'd with a masker and a reveller
Old Cassius still
If you dare fight today come to the field If not when you have stomachs
Why now blow and swell billow and swim bark
The storm is up and all is on the hazard
Ho Lucilius
Hark a word with you
My lord
Messala This is my birthday as this very day Was Cassius born
Give me thy hand Messala
Be thou my witness that against my will As Pompey was am I compell'd to set Upon one battle all our liberties
You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion
Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage
Coming from Sardis on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands Who to Philippi here consorted us
This morning are they fled away and gone And in their steads do ravens crows and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey
Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal under which Our army lies ready to give up the ghost
Believe not so
I but believe it partly For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly
Even so Lucilius
Now most noble Brutus The gods today stand friendly that we may Lovers in peace lead on our days to age
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain Let's reason with the worst that may befall
If we do lose this battle then is this The very last time we shall speak together
What are you then determined to do
Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself I know not how But I do find it cowardly and vile For fear of what might fall so to prevent The time of life arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below
Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome
No Cassius no
Therefore our everlasting farewell take
For ever and for ever farewell Cassius
If we do meet again why we shall smile If not why then this parting was well made
For ever and for ever farewell Brutus
If we do meet again we'll smile indeed If not 'tis true this parting was well made
Why then lead on
O that a man might know The end of this day's business ere it come
Away
Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side
Let them set on at once for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing And sudden push gives them the overthrow
Ride ride Messala
Let them all come down
O look Titinius look the villains fly
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy
This ensign here of mine was turning back I slew the coward and did take it from him
O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early Who having some advantage on Octavius Took it too eagerly
His soldiers fell to spoil Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed
Fly further off my lord fly further off Mark Antony is in your tents my lord Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off
This hill is far enough
Look look Titinius Are those my tents where I perceive the fire
They are my lord
Titinius if thou lovest me Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy
I will be here again even with a thought
O my lord
What news
O he lights too
Come hither sirrah
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner And then I swore thee saving of thy life That whatsoever I did bid thee do Thou shouldst attempt it
Come now keep thine oath Now be a freeman and with this good sword That ran through Caesar's bowels search this bosom
Far from this country Pindarus shall run Where never Roman shall take note of him
It is but change Titinius for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power As Cassius' legions are by Antony
These tidings would well comfort Cassius
Where did you leave him
All disconsolate With Pindarus his bondman on this hill
Is not that he that lies upon the ground
He lies not like the living
O my heart
Is not that he
Our day is gone Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed
O error soon conceived Thou never comest unto a happy birth But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee
What Pindarus
Where art thou Pindarus
Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus thrusting this report Into his ears
I may say “thrusting” it For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight
Did I not meet thy friends
And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee
Didst thou not hear their shouts
Alas thou hast misconstrued every thing
But hold thee take this garland on thy brow Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I Will do his bidding
Come Cassius' sword and find Titinius' heart
Where where Messala doth his body lie
Lo yonder and Titinius mourning it
Titinius' face is upward
He is slain
O Julius Caesar thou art mighty yet
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails
Brave Titinius
Look whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius
Yet countrymen O yet hold up your heads
What bastard doth not
Who will go with me
And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus I Brutus my country's friend know me for Brutus
O young and noble Cato art thou down
Why now thou diest as bravely as Titinius And mayst be honor'd being Cato's son
Yield or thou diest
Only I yield to die
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight Kill Brutus and be honor'd in his death
We must not
A noble prisoner
Room ho
Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en
I'll tell the news
Where is he
Safe Antony Brutus is safe enough
When you do find him or alive or dead He will be found like Brutus like himself
This is not Brutus friend but I assure you A prize no less in worth
Keep this man safe Give him all kindness I had rather have Such men my friends than enemies
Go on And see whether Brutus be alive or dead And bring us word unto Octavius' tent How every thing is chanced
Come poor remains of friends rest on this rock
Statilius show'd the torch light but my lord He came not back
He is or ta'en or slain
Sit thee down Clitus
Slaying is the word It is a deed in fashion
Hark thee Clitus
What I my lord
No not for all the world
Peace then no words
I'll rather kill myself
Hark thee Dardanius
Shall I do such a deed
O Dardanius
O Clitus
What ill request did Brutus make to thee
To kill him Clitus
Look he meditates
Now is that noble vessel full of grief That it runs over even at his eyes
Come hither good Volumnius list a word
What says my lord
I know my hour is come
Not so my lord
Nay I am sure it is Volumnius
Good Volumnius Thou know'st that we two went to school together Even for that our love of old I prithee Hold thou my sword hilts whilst I run on it
That's not an office for a friend my lord
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto
So fare you well at once for Brutus' tongue Hath almost ended his life's history
Night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest That have but labor'd to attain this hour
Fly my lord fly
Hence
Thou art a fellow of a good respect Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face While I do run upon it
Wilt thou Strato
Give me your hand first
Fare you well my lord
Farewell good Strato
What man is that
Ay if Messala will prefer me to you
Do so good Messala
How died my master Strato
I held the sword and he did run on it
Octavius then take him to follow thee That did the latest service to my master
This was the noblest Roman of them all
All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar He only in a general honest thought And common good to all made one of them
When shall we three meet again
In thunder lightning or in rain
When the hurlyburly's done When the battle's lost and won
That will be ere the set of sun
Where the place
Upon the heath
There to meet with Macbeth
Paddock calls
Anon
Fair is foul and foul is fair
Hover through the fog and filthy air
What bloody man is that
He can report As seemeth by his plight of the revolt The newest state
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought ’Gainst my captivity
Hail brave friend
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it
Doubtful it stood As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art
O valiant cousin
Worthy gentleman
As whence the sun ’gins his reflection Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come Discomfort swells
Dismay'd not this Our captains Macbeth and Banquo
Yes As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds Or memorize another Golgotha I cannot tell  But I am faint my gashes cry for help
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds They smack of honor both
Who comes here
The worthy Thane of Ross
What a haste looks through his eyes
So should he look That seems to speak things strange
God save the King
Whence camest thou worthy Thane
From Fife great King Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold
Great happiness
That now Sweno the Norways’ king craves composition Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest
Go pronounce his present death And with his former title greet Macbeth
I'll see it done
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won
Where hast thou been sister
Killing swine
Sister where thou
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap And mounch'd and mounch'd and mounch'd
Give me” quoth I
Aroint thee witch” the rump fed ronyon cries
I'll give thee a wind
Thou'rt kind
And I another
Weary se'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle peak and pine Though his bark cannot be lost Yet it shall be tempest tost
Look what I have
Show me show me
A drum a drum
Macbeth doth come
Peace
The charm's wound up
So foul and fair a day I have not seen
How far is't call'd to Forres
What are these So wither'd and so wild in their attire That look not like the inhabitants o’ the earth And yet are on't
Live you
or are you aught That man may question
You seem to understand me By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips
You should be women And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so
All hail Macbeth
hail to thee Thane of Glamis
All hail Macbeth
hail to thee Thane of Cawdor
Good sir why do you start and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair
I’ the name of truth Are ye fantastical or that indeed Which outwardly ye show
My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope That he seems rapt withal
To me you speak not
If you can look into the seeds of time And say which grain will grow and which will not Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear Your favors nor your hate
Hail
Hail
Hail
Lesser than Macbeth and greater
Not so happy yet much happier
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
Banquo and Macbeth all hail
Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis But how of Cawdor
The Thane of Cawdor lives A prosperous gentleman and to be King Stands not within the prospect of belief No more than to be Cawdor
Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting
Speak I charge you
The earth hath bubbles as the water has And these are of them
Whither are they vanish'd
Into the air and what seem'd corporal melted As breath into the wind
Would they had stay'd
Were such things here as we do speak about
Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner
Your children shall be kings
You shall be King
To the selfsame tune and words
Who's here
Silenced with that In viewing o'er the rest o’ the selfsame day He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make Strange images of death
As thick as hail Came post with post and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense And pour'd them down before him
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks Only to herald thee into his sight Not pay thee
And for an earnest of a greater honor He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor
In which addition hail most worthy Thane For it is thine
What can the devil speak true
The Thane of Cawdor lives
Why do you dress me In borrow'd robes
Who was the Thane lives yet But under heavy judgement bears that life Which he deserves to lose
Whether he was combined With those of Norway or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage or that with both He labor'd in his country's wreck I know not But treasons capital confess'd and proved Have overthrown him
Aside
The greatest is behind
Thanks for your pains
Do you not hope your children shall be kings When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me Promised no less to them
That trusted Might yet enkindle you unto the crown Besides the Thane of Cawdor
Aside
Aside
This supernatural Cannot be ill cannot be good
If ill Why hath it given me earnest of success Commencing in a truth
I am Thane of Cawdor
If good why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs Against the use of nature
Look how our partner's rapt
Aside
If chance will have me king why chance may crown me Without my stir
Aside
Come what come may [Aside
Come what come may Time and the hour runs through the roughest day
Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure
Kind gentlemen your pains Are register'd where every day I turn The leaf to read them
Let us toward the king
Think upon what hath chanced and at more time The interim having weigh'd it let us speak Our free hearts each to other
Very gladly
Till then enough
Come friends
Is execution done on Cawdor
Are not Those in commission yet return'd
My liege They are not yet come back
But I have spoke With one that saw him die who did report That very frankly he confess'd his treasons Implored your highness’ pardon and set forth A deep repentance
Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it he died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ’twere a careless trifle
O worthiest cousin
The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me
Thou art so far before That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee
Would thou hadst less deserved That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine
Only I have left to say More is thy due than more than all can pay
The service and the loyalty I owe In doing it pays itself
Welcome hither
I have begun to plant thee and will labor To make thee full of growing
Noble Banquo That hast no less deserved nor must be known No less to have done so let me enfold thee And hold thee to my heart
There if I grow The harvest is your own
My plenteous joys Wanton in fullness seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow
From hence to Inverness And bind us further to you
My worthy Cawdor
Aside
That is a step On which I must fall down or else o'erleap For in my way it lies
True worthy Banquo
He is full so valiant And in his commendations I am fed It is a banquet to me
Let's after him Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome It is a peerless kinsman
They met me in the day of success and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge
When I burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished
Yet do I fear thy nature It is too full o’ the milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way
Thou wouldst be great Art not without ambition but without The illness should attend it
The King comes here tonight
Thou'rt mad to say it
Is not thy master with him
One of my fellows had the speed of him Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more Than would make up his message
Give him tending He brings great news
The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements
Come you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here And fill me from the crown to the toe top full Of direst cruelty
Make thick my blood Stop up the access and passage to remorse That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between The effect and it
Come to my woman's breasts And take my milk for gall you murdering ministers Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature's mischief
Worthy Cawdor
Greater than both by the all hail hereafter
Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present and I feel now The future in the instant
My dearest love Duncan comes here tonight
And when goes hence
Tomorrow as he purposes
O never Shall sun that morrow see
Your face my Thane is as a book where men May read strange matters
We will speak further
This castle hath a pleasant seat the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses
This guest of summer The temple haunting martlet does approve By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here
No jutty frieze Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle Where they most breed and haunt I have observed The air is delicate
See see our honor'd hostess
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble Which still we thank as love
Herein I teach you How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains And thank us for your trouble
All our service In every point twice done and then done double Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your Majesty loads our house
For those of old And the late dignities heap'd up to them We rest your hermits
Where's the Thane of Cawdor
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor but he rides well And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him To his home before us
Fair and noble hostess We are your guest tonight
Your servants ever Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure Still to return your own
Give me your hand Conduct me to mine host
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him
By your leave hostess
If it were done when ’tis done then ’twere well It were done quickly
This even handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice To our own lips
He has almost supp'd
Why have you left the chamber
Hath he ask'd for me
Know you not he has
Was the hope drunk Wherein you dress'd yourself
Hath it slept since
And wakes it now to look so green and pale At what it did so freely
From this time Such I account thy love
Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire
Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life And live a coward in thine own esteem Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would” Like the poor cat i’ the adage
Prithee peace
I dare do all that may become a man Who dares do more is none
What beast was't then That made you break this enterprise to me
When you durst do it then you were a man And to be more than what you were you would Be so much more the man
Nor time nor place Did then adhere and yet you would make both They have made themselves and that their fitness now Does unmake you
If we should fail
We fail
But screw your courage to the sticking place And we'll not fail
When Duncan is asleep  Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey Soundly invite him his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory the warder of the brain Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason A limbec only
What not put upon His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell
Bring forth men children only For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males
Will it not be received When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers That they have done't
How goes the night boy
And she goes down at twelve
I take't ’tis later sir
Hold take my sword
Take thee that too
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me And yet I would not sleep
Merciful powers Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose
Give me my sword
Who's there
A friend
What sir not yet at rest
The King's a bed
Being unprepared Our will became the servant to defect Which else should free have wrought
All's well
At your kind'st leisure
If you shall cleave to my consent when ’tis It shall make honor for you
Good repose the while
Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready She strike upon the bell
Get thee to bed
Is this a dagger which I see before me The handle toward my hand
Come let me clutch thee
I have thee not and yet I see thee still
Art thou not fatal vision sensible To feeling as to sight
Or art thou but A dagger of the mind a false creation Proceeding from the heat oppressed brain
I see thee yet in form as palpable As this which now I draw
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going And such an instrument I was to use
Mine eyes are made the fools o’ the other senses Or else worth all the rest
I see thee still And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood Which was not so before
Thou sure and firm set earth Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout And take the present horror from the time Which now suits with it
Whiles I threat he lives Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
I go and it is done the bell invites me
Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell
Hark
Peace
It was the owl that shriek'd the fatal bellman Which gives the stern'st good night
He is about it The doors are open and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores I have drugg'd their possets That death and nature do contend about them Whether they live or die
Who's there
what ho
The attempt and not the deed Confounds us
Hark
Had he not resembled My father as he slept I had done't
My husband
I have done the deed
Didst thou not hear a noise
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
Did not you speak
When
Now
As I descended
Ay
Hark
Who lies i’ the second chamber
Donalbain
This is a sorry sight
There are two lodged together
But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”
I had most need of blessing and “Amen” Stuck in my throat
Me thought I heard a voice cry “Sleep no more
Why worthy Thane You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things
Go get some water And wash this filthy witness from your hand
Why did you bring these daggers from the place
They must lie there
Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood
Infirm of purpose
Give me the daggers
If he do bleed I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal For it must seem their guilt
Whence is that knocking
How is't with me when every noise appals me
What hands are here
Ha they pluck out mine eyes
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand
No this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine Making the green one red
My hands are of your color but I shame To wear a heart so white
Retire we to our chamber
Your constancy Hath left you unattended
Knock Knock Hark
more knocking Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers
Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts
To know my deed ’twere best not know myself
I would thou couldst
Here's a knocking indeed
If a man were porter of hell gate he should have old turning the key
Knock Knock Knock knock knock knock
Who's there i’ the name of Belzebub
Here's a farmer that hanged himself on th’ expectation of plenty
Knock Knock Knock knock
Who's there in th’ other devil's name
Faith here's an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale who committed treason enough for God's sake yet could not equivocate to heaven
O come in equivocator
Knock Knock Knock knock knock
Who's there
Faith here's an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose
Come in tailor here you may roast your goose
Knock Knock Knock knock
Never at quiet
What are you
But this place is too cold for hell
I'll devil porter it no further
I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire
Knock Knock Anon anon
I pray you remember the porter
Was it so late friend ere you went to bed That you do lie so late
What three things does drink especially provoke
Marry sir nose painting sleep and urine
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night
That it did sir i’ the very throat on me but I requited him for his lie and I think being too strong for him though he took up my legs sometime yet I made a shift to cast him
Is thy master stirring
Good morrow noble sir
Good morrow both
Is the King stirring worthy Thane
Not yet
I'll bring you to him
I know this is a joyful trouble to you But yet ’tis one
The labor we delight in physics pain
This is the door
I'll make so bold to call For ’tis my limited service
Goes the King hence today
The night has been unruly
Twas a rough night
My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it
O horror horror horror
Tongue nor heart Cannot conceive nor name thee
What's the matter
What's the matter
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece
Most sacrilegious Murder hath broke ope The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence The life o’ the building
What is't you say
the life
Mean you his Majesty
Approach the chamber and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon
Awake awake
Ring the alarum bell
Murder and treason
Banquo and Donalbain
Shake off this downy sleep death's counterfeit And look on death itself
Up up and see The great doom's image
Malcolm
Banquo
As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites To countenance this horror
What's the business That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house
Speak speak
O Banquo Banquo
Our royal master's murdered
Woe alas
What in our house
Too cruel any where
Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself And say it is not so
What is amiss
Your royal father's murdered
O by whom
O yet I do repent me of my fury That I did kill them
Wherefore did you so
Who can be wise amazed temperate and furious Loyal and neutral in a moment
Who could refrain That had a heart to love and in that heart Courage to make's love known
Help me hence ho
Look to the lady
Why do we hold our tongues That most may claim this argument for ours
What should be spoken here where our fate Hid in an auger hole may rush and seize us
Nor our strong sorrow [Aside to Donalbain
And so do I
So all
What will you do
To Ireland I our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer
This murderous shaft that's shot Hath not yet lighted and our safest way Is to avoid the aim
Therefore to horse And let us not be dainty of leave taking But shift away
There's warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there's no mercy left
Ah good father Thou seest the heavens as troubled with man's act Threaten his bloody stage
Tis unnatural Even like the deed that's done
On Tuesday last A falcon towering in her pride of place Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd
And Duncan's horses a thing most strange and certain  Beauteous and swift the minions of their race Turn'd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out Contending ’gainst obedience as they would make War with mankind
Tis said they eat each other
They did so to the amazement of mine eyes That look'd upon't
Here comes the good Macduff
How goes the world sir now
Why see you not
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed
Those that Macbeth hath slain
Alas the day
What good could they pretend
Gainst nature still
Thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up Thine own life's means
Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth
He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested
Where is Duncan's body
Carried to Colmekill The sacred storehouse of his predecessors And guardian of their bones
Will you to Scone
No cousin I'll to Fife
Well I will thither
Well may you see things well done there Adieu Lest our old robes sit easier than our new
Farewell father
God's benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes
If there come truth from them  As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine  Why by the verities on thee made good May they not be my oracles as well And set me up in hope
But hush no more
Here's our chief guest
If he had been forgotten It had been as a gap in our great feast And all thing unbecoming
Tonight we hold a solemn supper sir And I'll request your presence
Let your Highness Command upon me to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit
Ride you this afternoon
Ay my good lord
We should have else desired your good advice Which still hath been both grave and prosperous In this day's council but we'll take tomorrow
Is't far you ride
As far my lord as will fill up the time ’Twixt this and supper
Go not my horse the better I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain
Fail not our feast
My lord I will not
We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd In England and in Ireland not confessing Their cruel parricide filling their hearers With strange invention
But of that tomorrow When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly
Goes Fleance with you
Ay my good lord
Our time does call upon's
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot And so I do commend you to their backs
Farewell
While then God be with you
Sirrah a word with you
Attend those men Our pleasure
They are my lord without the palace gate
Bring them before us
To be thus is nothing But to be safely thus
Our fears in Banquo Stick deep and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear'd
Tis much he dares And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety
If't be so For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered Put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man To make them kings the seed of Banquo kings
Rather than so come Fate into the list And champion me to the utterance
Who's there
Now go to the door and stay there till we call
Was it not yesterday we spoke together
It was so please your Highness
Well then now Have you consider'd of my speeches
Know That it was he in the times past which held you So under fortune which you thought had been Our innocent self
I did so and went further which is now Our point of second meeting
Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go
Are you so gospell'd To pray for this good man and for his issue Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave And beggar'd yours for ever
We are men my liege
Ay in the catalogue ye go for men As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs Shoughs waterrugs and demi wolves are clept All by the name of dogs
I am one my liege Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world
And I another So weary with disasters tugg'd with fortune That I would set my life on any chance To mend it or be rid on ’t
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy
True my lord
So is he mine and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near'st of life and though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it yet I must not For certain friends that are both his and mine Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall Who I myself struck down
And thence it is That I to your assistance do make love Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons
We shall my lord Perform what you command us
Though our lives  Your spirits shine through you
Resolve yourselves apart I'll come to you anon
We are resolved my lord
I'll call upon you straight
Abide within
It is concluded Banquo thy soul's flight If it find heaven must find it out tonight
Is Banquo gone from court
Ay madam but returns again tonight
Say to the King I would attend his leisure For a few words
Madam I will
Nought's had all's spent Where our desire is got without content
Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
How now my lord
Why do you keep alone Of sorriest fancies your companions making Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on
Things without all remedy Should be without regard
What's done is done
But let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly
Better be with the dead Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy
Come on Gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
You must leave this
O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives
But in them nature's copy's not eterne
There's comfort yet they are assailable
Then be thou jocund
Ere the bat hath flown His cloister'd flight ere to black Hecate's summons The shard borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night's yawning peal there shall be done A deed of dreadful note
What's to be done
Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck Till thou applaud the deed
Come seeling night Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale
Thou marvell'st at my words but hold thee still Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
So prithee go with me
But who did bid thee join with us
Macbeth
He needs not our mistrust since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just
Then stand with us
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day Now spurs the lated traveller apace To gain the timely inn and near approaches The subject of our watch
Hark
I hear horses
Give us a light there ho
Then ’tis he the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i’ the court
His horses go about
A light a light
Tis he
Stand to't
It will be rain tonight
Let it come down
O treachery
Fly good Fleance fly fly fly
Thou mayst revenge
O slave
Who did strike out the light
We have lost best half of our affair
Well let's away and say how much is done
At first And last the hearty welcome
Thanks to your Majesty
Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host
Our hostess keeps her state but in best time We will require her welcome
Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends For my heart speaks they are welcome
See they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks
There's blood upon thy face
Tis Banquo's then
Tis better thee without than he within
Is he dispatch'd
If thou didst it Thou art the nonpareil
Most royal sir Fleance is 'scaped
Ay my good lord
Thanks for that
There the grown serpent lies the worm that's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed No teeth for the present
Get thee gone
Tomorrow We'll hear ourselves again
My royal lord You do not give the cheer
The feast is sold That is not often vouch'd while ’tis a making ’Tis given with welcome
To feed were best at home From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony Meeting were bare without it
Sweet remembrancer
Now good digestion wait on appetite And health on both
May't please your Highness sit
ROSS His absence sir Lays blame upon his promise
Please't your Highness To grace us with your royal company
The table's full
Here is a place reserved sir
Where
Here my good lord
What is't that moves your Highness
Which of you have done this
What my good lord
Pray you keep seat
The fit is momentary upon a thought He will again be well
Are you a man
Ay and a bold one that dare look on that Which might appal the devil
O these flaws and starts Impostors to true fear would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire Authorized by her grandam
Shame itself
Why do you make such faces
When all's done You look but on a stool
Prithee see there
Behold
Look
Lo
How say you
Why what care I
If thou canst nod speak too
If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back our monuments Shall be the maws of kites
Fie for shame
This is more strange Than such a murder is
My worthy lord Your noble friends do lack you
I do forget
Do not muse at me my most worthy friends
I have a strange infirmity which is nothing To those that know me
Come love and health to all Then I'll sit down
Give me some wine fill full
I drink to the general joy o’ the whole table And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss
Would he were here
To all and him we thirst And all to all
Avaunt and quit my sight
Let the earth hide thee
Think of this good peers But as a thing of custom
What man dare I dare
Or be alive again And dare me to the desert with thy sword
If trembling I inhabit then protest me The baby of a girl
Hence horrible shadow
Unreal mockery hence
Why so being gone I am a man again
Pray you sit still
You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting With most admired disorder
Can such things be And overcome us like a summer's cloud Without our special wonder
You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe When now I think you can behold such sights And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks When mine is blanch'd with fear
ROSS What sights my lord
At once good night Stand not upon the order of your going But go at once
Good night and better health Attend his Majesty
A kind good night to all
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak Augures and understood relations have By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret'st man of blood
What is the night
Almost at odds with morning which is which
How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding
Did you send to him sir
I hear it by the way but I will send
There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd
I will tomorrow And betimes I will to the weird sisters
More shall they speak for now I am bent to know By the worst means the worst
For mine own good All causes shall give way
I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that should I wade no more Returning were as tedious as go o'er
Strange things I have in head that will to hand Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd
You lack the season of all natures sleep
Come we'll to sleep
We are yet but young in deed
Why how now Hecate
You look angerly
Have I not reason beldams as you are Saucy and overbold
How did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death And I the mistress of your charms The close contriver of all harms Was never call'd to bear my part Or show the glory of our art
And which is worse all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son Spiteful and wrathful who as others do Loves for his own ends not for you
But make amends now
Get you gone And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i’ the morning
Thither he Will come to know his destiny
Your vessels and your spells provide Your charms and every thing beside
And that distill'd by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion
He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear His hopes ’bove wisdom grace and fear
And you all know security Is mortals’ chiefest enemy
Music and a song Music and a song Hark
And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late Whom you may say if't please you Fleance kill'd For Fleance fled
Men must not walk too late
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father
Damned fact
How it did grieve Macbeth
Did he not straight In pious rage the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
Was not that nobly done
Ay and wisely too For ’twould have anger'd any heart alive To hear the men deny't
So that I say He has borne all things well and I do think That had he Duncan's sons under his key  As an't please heaven he shall not they should find What ’twere to kill a father so should Fleance
But peace
For from broad words and ’cause he fail'd His presence at the tyrant's feast I hear Macduff lives in disgrace
Sir can you tell Where he bestows himself
The son of Duncan From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth Lives in the English court and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect
And this report Hath so exasperate the King that he Prepares for some attempt of war
Sent he to Macduff
Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed
I'll send my prayers with him
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd
Thrice and once the hedge pig whined
Toad that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty one Swelter'd venom sleeping got Boil thou first i’ the charmed pot
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Fillet of a fenny snake In the cauldron boil and bake Eye of newt and toe of frog Wool of bat and tongue of dog Adder's fork and blind worm's sting Lizard's leg and howlet's wing For a charm of powerful trouble Like a hell broth boil and bubble
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Scale of dragon tooth of wolf Witch's mummy maw and gulf Of the ravin'd salt sea shark Root of hemlock digg'd i’ the dark Liver of blaspheming Jew Gall of goat and slips of yew Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips Finger of birth strangled babe Ditch deliver'd by a drab Make the gruel thick and slab
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron For the ingredients of our cauldron
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Cool it with a baboon's blood Then the charm is firm and good
O well done
How now you secret black and midnight hags
What is't you do
A deed without a name
I conjure you by that which you profess Howe'er you come to know it answer me Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches though the yeasty waves Confound and swallow navigation up Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down Though castles topple on their warders’ heads Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations though the treasure Of nature's germens tumble all together Even till destruction sicken answer me To what I ask you
Speak
Demand
We'll answer
Say if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths or from our masters
Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten Her nine farrow grease that's sweaten From the murderer's gibbet throw Into the flame
Come high or low Thyself and office deftly show
Macbeth
Macbeth
Macbeth
Beware Macduff Beware the Thane of Fife
Dismiss me
Enough
Whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks Thou hast harp'd my fear aright
Here's another More potent than the first
Macbeth
Macbeth
Macbeth
Had I three ears I'd hear thee
What need I fear of thee
What is this That rises like the issue of a king And wears upon his baby brow the round And top of sovereignty
Listen but speak not to't
That will never be
Who can impress the forest bid the tree Unfix his earth bound root
Sweet bodements good
Rebellion's head rise never till the Wood Of Birnam rise and our high placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature pay his breath To time and mortal custom
Seek to know no more
I will be satisfied
Deny me this And an eternal curse fall on you
Show
Show
Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo
Down
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs
Filthy hags
Why do you show me this
A fourth
Start eyes
What will the line stretch out to the crack of doom
Another yet
A seventh
Now I see ’tis true For the blood bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me And points at them for his
Ay sir all this is so
But why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly
Come sisters cheer we up his sprites And show the best of our delights
I'll charm the air to give a sound While you perform your antic round That this great King may kindly say Our duties did his welcome pay
Where are they
Gone
Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursed in the calendar
Come in without there
What's your Grace's will
Saw you the weird sisters
No my lord
Came they not by you
No indeed my lord
Infected be the air whereon they ride And damn'd all those that trust them
I did hear The galloping of horse
Who was't came by
Tis two or three my lord that bring you word Macduff is fled to England
Fled to England
Ay my good lord
Time thou anticipatest my dread exploits
Time thou The flighty purpose never is o'ertook Unless the deed go with it
From this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand
No boasting like a fool This deed I'll do before this purpose cool
Come bring me where they are
What had he done to make him fly the land
You must have patience madam
When our actions do not Our fears do make us traitors
You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear
Wisdom
To leave his wife to leave his babes His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly
My dearest coz I pray you school yourself
But for your husband He is noble wise judicious and best knows The fits o’ the season
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward To what they were before
My pretty cousin Blessing upon you
Father'd he is and yet he's fatherless
I am so much a fool should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort
I take my leave at once
How will you live
As birds do Mother
What with worms and flies
With what I get I mean and so do they
Poor bird
Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime The pitfall nor the gin
Why should I Mother
Poor birds they are not set for
My father is not dead for all your saying
Yes he is dead
How wilt thou do for a father
Nay how will you do for a husband
Why I can buy me twenty at any market
Then you'll buy ’em to sell again
Thou speak'st with all thy wit and yet i’ faith With wit enough for thee
Was my father a traitor Mother
Ay that he was
What is a traitor
Why one that swears and lies
And be all traitors that do so
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be hanged
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie
Every one
Who must hang them
Why the honest men
Then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them
Now God help thee poor monkey
But how wilt thou do for a father
Poor prattler how thou talk'st
Bless you fair dame
I am not to you known Though in your state of honor I am perfect
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly
If you will take a homely man's advice Be not found here hence with your little ones
Heaven preserve you
I dare abide no longer
Whither should I fly
I have done no harm
But I remember now I am in this earthly world where to do harm Is often laudable to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly
Where is your husband
I hope in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him
He's a traitor
Thou liest thou shag ear'd villain
What you egg
Young fry of treachery
He has kill'd me Mother
Run away I pray you
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty
Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men Bestride our downfall'n birthdom
Each new morn New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows Strike heaven on the face that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out Like syllable of dolor
What you have spoke it may be so perchance
This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues Was once thought honest
You have loved him well He hath not touch'd you yet
I am young but something You may deserve of him through me and wisdom To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb To appease an angry god
I am not treacherous
But Macbeth is
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge
Angels are bright still though the brightest fell
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace Yet grace must still look so
I have lost my hopes
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts
Why in that rawness left you wife and child Those precious motives those strong knots of love Without leave taking
I pray you Let not my jealousies be your dishonors But mine own safeties
You may be rightly just Whatever I shall think
Bleed bleed poor country
Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure For goodness dare not check thee
Wear thou thy wrongs The title is affeer'd
Fare thee well lord
I would not be the villain that thou think'st For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp And the rich East to boot
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds
I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands
But for all this When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before More suffer and more sundry ways than ever By him that shall succeed
What should he be
It is myself I mean in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That when they shall be open'd black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb being compared With my confineless harms
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd In evils to top Macbeth
I grant him bloody Luxurious avaricious false deceitful Sudden malicious smacking of every sin That has a name
But there's no bottom none In my voluptuousness
Your wives your daughters Your matrons and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will
Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours
You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
We have willing dames enough there cannot be That vulture in you to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves Finding it so inclined
With this there grows In my most ill composed affection such A stanchless avarice that were I King I should cut off the nobles for their lands Desire his jewels and this other's house And my more having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal Destroying them for wealth
This avarice Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root Than summer seeming lust and it hath been The sword of our slain kings
Yet do not fear Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will Of your mere own
All these are portable With other graces weigh'd
But I have none
The king becoming graces As justice verity temperance stableness Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness Devotion patience courage fortitude I have no relish of them but abound In the division of each several crime Acting it many ways
Nay had I power I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell Uproar the universal peace confound All unity on earth
O Scotland Scotland
If such a one be fit to govern speak
I am as I have spoken
Fit to govern
No not to live
Thy royal father Was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee Oftener upon her knees than on her feet Died every day she lived
Fare thee well
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself Have banish'd me from Scotland
O my breast Thy hope ends here
Macduff this noble passion Child of integrity hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor
Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me From over credulous haste
But God above Deal between thee and me
For even now I put myself to thy direction and Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself For strangers to my nature
I am yet Unknown to woman never was forsworn Scarcely have coveted what was mine own At no time broke my faith would not betray The devil to his fellow and delight No less in truth than life
My first false speaking Was this upon myself
What I am truly Is thine and my poor country's to command Whither indeed before thy here approach Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point was setting forth
Now we'll together and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel
Why are you silent
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once ’Tis hard to reconcile
Well more anon
Comes the King forth I pray you
I thank you Doctor
What's the disease he means
Tis call'd the evil A most miraculous work in this good King Which often since my here remain in England I have seen him do
With this strange virtue He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy And sundry blessings hang about his throne That speak him full of grace
See who comes here
My countryman but yet I know him not
My ever gentle cousin welcome hither
I know him now
Good God betimes remove The means that makes us strangers
Sir amen
Stands Scotland where it did
Alas poor country Almost afraid to know itself
It cannot Be call'd our mother but our grave
Where nothing But who knows nothing is once seen to smile Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air Are made not mark'd where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy
The dead man's knell Is there scarce ask'd for who and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps Dying or ere they sicken
O relation Too nice and yet too true
What's the newest grief
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker Each minute teems a new one
How does my wife
Why well
And all my children
Well too
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace
No they were well at peace when I did leave ’em
Be't their comfort We are coming thither
Would I could answer This comfort with the like
But I have words That would be howl'd out in the desert air Where hearing should not latch them
What concern they
The general cause
Or is it a fee grief Due to some single breast
No mind that's honest But in it shares some woe though the main part Pertains to you alone
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard
Your castle is surprised your wife and babes Savagely slaughter'd
To relate the manner Were on the quarry of these murder'd deer To add the death of you
Merciful heaven
What man
Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows Give sorrow words
The grief that does not speak Whispers the o'er fraught heart and bids it break
My children too
Wife children servants all That could be found
And I must be from thence
My wife kill'd too
I have said
Be comforted
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge To cure this deadly grief
He has no children
All my pretty ones
Did you say all
O hell kite
All
What all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop
Dispute it like a man
I shall do so But I must also feel it as a man
I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me
Did heaven look on And would not take their part
Sinful Macduff They were all struck for thee
Naught that I am Not for their own demerits but for mine Fell slaughter on their souls
Heaven rest them now
Be this the whetstone of your sword
O I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue
This tune goes manly
Come go we to the King our power is ready Our lack is nothing but our leave
Macbeth Is ripe for shaking and the powers above Put on their instruments
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report
When was it she last walked
Since his Majesty went into the field I have seen her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upon't read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep
A great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching
In this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say
That sir which I will not report after her
You may to me and ’tis most meet you should
Neither to you nor any one having no witness to confirm my speech
Lo you here she comes
This is her very guise and upon my life fast asleep
Observe her stand close
How came she by that light
Why it stood by her
She has light by her continually ’tis her command
You see her eyes are open
Ay but their sense is shut
What is it she does now
Look how she rubs her hands
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands
I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour
Yet here's a spot
Hark she speaks
I will set down what comes from her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
Out damned spot
Out I say
One–two  why then ’tis time to do't
Hell is murky
Fie my lord fie
A soldier and afeard
What need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account
Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him
Do you mark that
The Thane of Fife had a wife where is she now
What will these hands ne'er be clean
No more o’ that my lord no more o’ that
You mar all with this starting
Go to go to you have known what you should not
She has spoke what she should not I am sure of that
Heaven knows what she has known
Here's the smell of the blood still
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand
Oh oh oh
What a sigh is there
The heart is sorely charged
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body
Well well well  Pray God it be sir
This disease is beyond my practice
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds
Wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so pale
I tell you yet again Banquo's buried he cannot come out on's grave
Even so
To bed to bed there's knocking at the gate
Come come come come give me your hand
What's done cannot be undone
To bed to bed to bed
Will she go now to bed
Directly
Foul whisperings are abroad
God God forgive us all
Good night good doctor
The English power is near led on by Malcolm His uncle Siward and the good Macduff
Revenges burn in them for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man
Near Birnam Wood Shall we well meet them that way are they coming
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother
There is Siward's son And many unrough youths that even now Protest their first of manhood
What does the tyrant
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies
Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him like a giant's robe Upon a dwarfish thief
Who then shall blame His pester'd senses to recoil and start When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there
Well march we on To give obedience where ’tis truly owed
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal And with him pour we in our country's purge Each drop of us
Or so much as it needs To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
Make we our march towards Birnam
Bring me no more reports let them fly all
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear
What's the boy Malcolm
Was he not born of woman
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear
The devil damn thee black thou cream faced loon
Where got'st thou that goose look
Soldiers sir
Go prick thy face and over red thy fear Thou lily liver'd boy
What soldiers patch
Death of thy soul
Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear
What soldiers whey face
The English force so please you
Take thy face hence
Seyton I am sick at heart When I behold Seyton I say This push Will cheer me ever or disseat me now
I have lived long enough
My way of life Is fall'n into the sear the yellow leaf And that which should accompany old age As honor love obedience troops of friends I must not look to have but in their stead Curses not loud but deep mouth honor breath Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not
Seyton
What's your gracious pleasure
What news more
All is confirm'd my lord which was reported
I'll fight ’til from my bones my flesh be hack'd
Give me my armor
Tis not needed yet
I'll put it on
Give me mine armor
How does your patient doctor
Not so sick my lord As she is troubled with thick coming fancies That keep her from her rest
Cure her of that
Therein the patient Must minister to himself
Throw physic to the dogs I'll none of it
Seyton send out
Doctor the thanes fly from me
Come sir dispatch
If thou couldst doctor cast The water of my land find her disease And purge it to a sound and pristine health I would applaud thee to the very echo That should applaud again
Pull't off I say
What rhubarb senna or what purgative drug Would scour these English hence
Hear'st thou of them
Bring it after me
I will not be afraid of death and bane Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane
Cousins I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe
We doubt it nothing
What wood is this before us
The Wood of Birnam
It shall be done
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before't
Let our just censures Attend the true event and put we on Industrious soldiership
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate But certain issue strokes must arbitrate Towards which advance the war
Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up
Were they not forced with those that should be ours We might have met them dareful beard to beard And beat them backward home
What is that noise
It is the cry of women my good lord
Wherefore was that cry
The Queen my lord is dead
Out out brief candle
Life's but a walking shadow a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more
It is a tale Told by an idiot full of sound and fury Signifying nothing
Gracious my lord I should report that which I say I saw But know not how to do it
Well say sir
As I did stand my watch upon the hill I look'd toward Birnam and anon methought The Wood began to move
Liar and slave
Let me endure your wrath if't be not so
Within this three mile may you see it coming I say a moving grove
I pull in resolution and begin To doubt the equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth
Fear not till Birnam Wood Do come to Dunsinane” and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane
Arm arm and out
If this which he avouches does appear There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
I ’gin to be aweary of the sun And wish the estate o’ the world were now undone
Ring the alarum bell
Blow wind
Come wrack
At least we'll die with harness on our back
Now near enough your leavy screens throw down And show like those you are
Fare you well
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight Let us be beaten if we cannot fight
What's he That was not born of woman
Such a one Am I to fear or none
What is thy name
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it
My name's Macbeth
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear
No nor more fearful
Thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword I'll prove the lie thou speak'st
Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born
That way the noise is
Tyrant show thy face
If thou beest slain and with no stroke of mine My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still
Let me find him fortune
And more I beg not
This way my lord the castle's gently render'd
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight The noble thanes do bravely in the war The day almost itself professes yours And little is to do
We have met with foes That strike beside us
Enter sir the castle
Why should I play the Roman fool and die On mine own sword
Whiles I see lives the gashes Do better upon them
Turn hell hound turn
Of all men else I have avoided thee
Thou losest labor
Despair thy charm And let the angel whom thou still hast served Tell thee Macduff was from his mother's womb Untimely ripp'd
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so For it hath cow'd my better part of man
And be these juggling fiends no more believed That palter with us in a double sense That keep the word of promise to our ear And break it to our hope
I'll not fight with thee
Then yield thee coward And live to be the show and gaze o’ the time
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane And thou opposed being of no woman born Yet I will try the last
Before my body I throw my warlike shield
Macduff is missing and your noble son
Then he is dead
Ay and brought off the field
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth for then It hath no end
Had he his hurts before
Ay on the front
Why then God's soldier be he
Had I as many sons as I have hairs I would not wish them to a fairer death
And so his knell is knoll'd
Here comes newer comfort
Behold where stands The usurper's cursed head
The time is free
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl That speak my salutation in their minds Whose voices I desire aloud with mine Hail King of Scotland
Hail King of Scotland
We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves And make us even with you
My thanes and kinsmen Henceforth be Earls the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named
In sooth I know not why I am so sad It wearies me you say it wearies you But how I caught it found it or came by it What stuff 'tis made of whereof it is born I am to learn And such a want wit sadness makes of me That I have much ado to know myself
Your mind is tossing on the ocean There where your argosies with portly sail  Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood Or as it were the pageants of the sea  Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curt'sy to them do them reverence As they fly by them with their woven wings
Believe me sir had I such venture forth The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad
I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad
My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea
I should not see the sandy hour glass run But I should think of shallows and of flats And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial
Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks Which touching but my gentle vessel's side Would scatter all her spices on the stream Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks And in a word but even now worth this And now worth nothing
Shall I have the thought To think on this and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad
But tell not me I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise
Believe me no I thank my fortune for it My ventures are not in one bottom trusted Nor to one place nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
Not in love neither
Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry and 'twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad
Now by two headed Janus Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bag piper And other of such vinegar aspect That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry If worthier friends had not prevented me
Your worth is very dear in my regard
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace the occasion to depart
Good morrow my good lords
Good signiors both when shall we laugh
say when
You grow exceeding strange must it be so
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours
My Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio We two will leave you but at dinner time I pray you have in mind where we must meet
I will not fail you
I hold the world but as the world Gratiano A stage where every man must play a part And mine a sad one
Well we will leave you then till dinner time
I must be one of these same dumb wise men For Gratiano never lets me speak
Well keep me company but two years more Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
Farewell I'll grow a talker for this gear
Thanks i' faith for silence is only commendable In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible
Is that any thing now
Well tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage That you to day promis'd to tell me of
Tis not unknown to you Antonio How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd From such a noble rate but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time something too prodigal Hath left me gag'd
To you Antonio I owe the most in money and in love And from your love I have a warranty To unburthen all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe
I pray you good Bassanio let me know it And if it stand as you yourself still do Within the eye of honour be assur'd My purse my person my extremest means Lie all unlock'd to your occasions
In my schooldays when I had lost one shaft I shot his fellow of the self same flight The self same way with more advised watch To find the other forth and by adventuring both I oft found both I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence
I owe you much and like a wilful youth That which I owe is lost but if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt As I will watch the aim or to find both Or bring your latter hazard back again And thankfully rest debtor for the first
You know me well and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have
Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done And I am prest unto it therefore speak
In Belmont is a lady richly left And she is fair and fairer than that word Of wondrous virtues
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand And many Jasons come in quest of her
O my Antonio
had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do That shall be rack'd even to the uttermost To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia
Go presently inquire and so will I Where money is and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake
By my troth Nerissa my little body is a weary of this great world
You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing
It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer
Good sentences and well pronounced
They would be better if well followed
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces
It is a good divine that follows his own instructions I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching
The brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband O me the word choose
Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead (whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you) will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love
But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come
Ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself I am much afraid my lady his mother played false with a smith
Then is there the county Palatine
He doth nothing but frown as who should say An you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth
I had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these
God defend me from these two
How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man
In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but he
What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron of England
You know I say nothing to him for he understands not me nor I him he hath neither Latin French nor Italian and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English
How oddly he is suited
I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his behaviour everywhere
What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another
How like you the young German the Duke of Saxony's nephew
Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast and the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall make shift to go without him
If he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your father's will if you should refuse to accept him
Therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without I know he will choose it
I will do anything Nerissa ere I will be married to a sponge
You need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposition depending on the caskets
If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will
I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence and I pray God grant them a fair departure
Do you not remember lady in your father's time a Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat
Yes yes it was Bassanio as I think so was he called
True madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady
I remember him well and I remember him worthy of thy praise
How now
what news
The four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the prince his master will be here to night
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had rather he should shrive me than wive me
Come Nerissa
Three thousand ducats well
Ay sir for three months
For three months well
For the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound
Antonio shall become bound well
May you stead me
Will you pleasure me
Shall I know your answer
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound
Your answer to that
Antonio is a good man
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary
But ships are but boards sailors but men there be land rats and water rats land thieves and water thieves I mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks
The man is notwithstanding sufficient three thousand ducats  I think I may take his bond
Be assured you may
I will be assured I may and that I may be assured I will bethink me
May I speak with Antonio
If it please you to dine with us
Yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into
This is Signior Antonio
How like a fawning publican he looks
I hate him for he is a Christian But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice
If I can catch him once upon the hip I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him
He hates our sacred nation and he rails Even there where merchants most do congregate On me my bargains and my well won thrift Which he calls interest
Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him
Shylock do you hear
I am debating of my present store And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats
What of that
Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe Will furnish me
Shylock albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend I'll break a custom Is he yet possess'd How much you would
Ay ay three thousand ducats
And for three months
Well then your bond and let me see
but hear you Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage
I do never use it
did he take interest
No not take interest not as you would say Directly interest mark what Jacob did
When Laban and himself were compromis'd That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied Should fall as Jacob's hire the ewes being rank In the end of autumn turned to the rams And when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act The skilful shepherd pill'd me certain wands And in the doing of the deed of kind He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes Who then conceiving did in eaning time Fall party colour'd lambs and those were Jacob's
This was a way to thrive and he was blest And thrift is blessing if men steal it not
This was a venture sir that Jacob serv'd for A thing not in his power to bring to pass But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of Heaven
Was this inserted to make interest good
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
I cannot tell I make it breed as fast But note me signior
Mark you this Bassanio The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek A goodly apple rotten at the heart O what a goodly outside falsehood hath
Three thousand ducats 'tis a good round sum
Three months from twelve then let me see the rate
Well Shylock shall we be beholden to you
Signior Antonio many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances Still have I borne it with a patient shrug For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe You call me misbeliever cut throat dog And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine And all for use of that which is mine own
Well then it now appears you need my help Go to then you come to me and you say Shylock we would have monies you say so You that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold monies is your suit
What should I say to you
Should I not say Hath a dog money
Why look you how you storm
This were kindness
Content in faith I'll seal to such a bond And say there is much kindness in the Jew
You shall not seal to such a bond for me I'll rather dwell in my necessity
Why fear not man I will not forfeit it Within these two months that's a month before This bond expires I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond
O father Abram what these Christians are Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others
Pray you tell me this If he should break his day what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable profitable neither As flesh of muttons beefs or goats
I say To buy his favour I extend this friendship If he will take it so if not adieu And for my love I pray you wrong me not
Yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's Give him direction for this merry bond And I will go and purse the ducats straight See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave and presently I will be with you
Hie thee gentle Jew
This Hebrew will turn Christian he grows kind
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind
Come on in this there can be no dismay My ships come home a month before the day
Mislike me not for my complexion The shadowed livery of the burnish'd sun To whom I am a neighbour and near bred
Bring me the fairest creature northward born Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles And let us make incision for your love To prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden's eyes Besides the lottery of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing But if my father had not scanted me And hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself His wife who wins me by that means I told you Yourself renowned prince then stood as fair As any comer I have look'd on yet For my affection
Even for that I thank you Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune
By this scimitar  That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman  I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she bear Yea mock the lion when he roars for prey To win thee lady
But alas the while
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice Which is the better man the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker hand So is Alcides beaten by his page And so may I blind fortune leading me Miss that which one unworthier may attain And die with grieving
You must take your chance And either not attempt to choose at all Or swear before you choose if you choose wrong Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage therefore be advis'd
First forward to the temple after dinner Your hazard shall be made
To make me bless'd or cursed'st among men
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master
The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me saying to me Gobbo Launcelot Gobbo good Launcelot or good Gobbo or good Launcelot Gobbo use your legs take the start run away My conscience says no take heed honest Launcelot take heed honest Gobbo or (as aforesaid) honest Launcelot Gobbo do not run scorn running with thy heels well the most courageous fiend bids me pack Via
says the fiend away
Master young man you I pray you which is the way to master Jew's
O heavens this is my true begotten father
who being more than sand blind high gravel blind knows me not I will try confusions with him
Master young gentleman I pray you which is the way to master Jew's
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning but at the next turning of all on your left marry at the very next turning turn of no hand but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house
By God's sonties 'twill be a hard way to hit
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him dwell with him or no
Talk you of young Master Launcelot Mark me now now will I raise the waters Talk you of young master Launcelot
No master sir but a poor man's son his father though I say it is an honest exceeding poor man and God be thanked well to live
Well let his father be what a will we talk of young master Launcelot
Your worship's friend and Launcelot sir
But I pray you ergo old man ergo I beseech you talk you of young master Launcelot
Of Launcelot an't please your mastership
Marry God forbid
the boy was the very staff of my age my very prop
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel post a staff or a prop
Do you know me father
Do you not know me father
Alack sir I am sand blind I know you not
Nay indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of the knowing me it is a wise father that knows his own child
Pray you sir stand up I am sure you are not Launcelot my boy
Pray you let's have no more fooling about it but give me your blessing I am Launcelot your boy that was your son that is your child that shall be
I cannot think you are my son
I know not what I shall think of that but I am Launcelot the Jew's man and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother
Her name is Margery indeed I'll be sworn if thou be Launcelot thou art mine own flesh and blood
thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my phill horse has on his tail
It should seem then that Dobbin's tail grows backward I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him
How dost thou and thy master agree
I have brought him a present
How 'gree you now
Well well but for mine own part as I have set up my rest to run away so I will not rest till I have run some ground
My master's a very Jew
give him a halter I am famished in his service you may tell every finger I have with my ribs
here comes the man to him father for I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer
You may do so but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock
See these letters delivered put the liveries to making and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging
To him father
God bless your worship
wouldst thou aught with me
Here's my son sir a poor boy  Not a poor boy sir but the rich Jew's man that would sir as my father shall specify  He hath a great infection sir as one would say to serve  Indeed the short and the long is I serve the Jew and have a desire as my father shall specify  His master and he (saving your worship's reverence) are scarce cater cousins  To be brief the very truth is that the Jew having done me wrong doth cause me as my father being I hope an old man shall frutify unto you   I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship and my suit is  In very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as your worship shall know by this honest old man and though I say it though old man yet poor man my father
One speak for both what would you
That is the very defect of the matter sir
The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you sir you have the grace of God sir and he hath enough
Thou speak'st it well
If any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book I shall have good fortune
here's a small trifle of wives alas fifteen wives is nothing aleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming in for one man and then to 'scape drowning thrice and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather bed here are simple 'scapes
Well if fortune be a woman she's a good wench for this gear Father come
I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye
My best endeavours shall be done herein
Where's your master
Yonder sir he walks
Signior Bassanio  Gratiano
I have a suit to you
You have obtain'd it
Signior Bassanio hear me If I do not put on a sober habit Talk with respect and swear but now and then Wear prayer books in my pocket look demurely Nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes Thus with my hat and sigh and say Amen Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam never trust me more
Well we shall see your bearing
Nay but I bar to night you shall not gage me By what we do to night
No that were pity I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends That purpose merriment
But fare you well I have some business
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest But we will visit you at supper time
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so Our house is hell and thou a merry devil Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness But fare thee well there is a ducat for thee
Adieu tears exhibit my tongue
Most beautiful pagan most sweet Jew
If a Christian did not play the knave and get thee I am much deceived
But adieu
these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit adieu
Farewell good Launcelot
Alack what heinous sin is it in me To be asham'd to be my father's child
If thou keep promise I shall end this strife Become a Christian and thy loving wife
Nay we will slink away in supper time Disguise us at my lodging and return All in an hour
We have not made good preparation
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers
Tis vile unless it may be quaintly ordered And better in my mind not undertook
An it shall please you to break up this it shall seem to signify
I know the hand in faith 'tis a fair hand And whiter than the paper it writ on Is the fair hand that writ
Love news in faith
By your leave sir
Whither goest thou
Marry sir to bid my old master the Jew to sup to night with my new master the Christian
I am provided of a torch bearer
Ay marry I'll be gone about it straight
And so will I
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence
Tis good we do so
Was not that letter from fair Jessica
I must needs tell thee all
She hath directed How I shall take her from her father's house What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with What page's suit she hath in readiness
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven It will be for his gentle daughter's sake And never dare misfortune cross her foot Unless she do it under this excuse  That she is issue to a faithless Jew
Come go with me peruse this as thou goest Fair Jessica shall be my torchbearer
Quick quick I pray thee draw the curtain straight The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently
Behold there stand the caskets noble prince If you choose that wherein I am contain'd Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd But if you fail without more speech my lord You must be gone from hence immediately
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things First never to unfold to any one Which casket 'twas I chose next if I fail Of the right casket never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage Lastly If I do fail in fortune of my choice Immediately to leave you and be gone
To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self
What says the golden chest
ha
let me see Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
What many men desire that many may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach Which pries not to th' interior but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall Even in the force and road of casualty
I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes
and that clear honour Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer
Well but to my choice Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
I will assume desert Give me a key for this And instantly unlock my fortunes here
Too long a pause for that which you find there
What's here
the portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a schedule
I will read it
How much unlike art thou to Portia
Is that my prize
are my deserts no better
To offend and judge are distinct offices And of opposed natures
What is here
Sweet adieu
I'll keep my oath Patiently to bear my wroth
Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth
O these deliberate fools
when they do choose They have the wisdom by their wit to lose
Where is my lady
Here what would my lord
No more I pray thee I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee Thou spend'st such high day wit in praising him
Come come Nerissa for I long to see Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly
Bassanio lord Love if thy will it be
Well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio  What Jessica thou shalt not gormandise As thou hast done with me What Jessica  And sleep and snore and rend apparel out  Why Jessica I say
Why Jessica
Who bids thee call
I do not bid thee call
Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding
Call you
What is your will
I am not bid for love they flatter me But yet I'll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian Jessica my girl Look to my house I am right loath to go There is some ill a brewing towards my rest For I did dream of money bags to night
I beseech you sir go my young master doth expect your reproach
So do I his
And they have conspired together I will not say you shall see a masque but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on Black  Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in the afternoon
What
are there masques
Hear you me Jessica Lock up my doors and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry neck'd fife Clamber not you up to the casements then Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces But stop my house's ears I mean my casements Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter My sober house By Jacob's staff I swear I have no mind of feasting forth to night But I will go Go you before me sirrah Say I will come
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring ha
His words were Farewell mistress nothing else
Farewell and if my fortune be not cross'd I have a father you a daughter lost
This is the pent house under which Lorenzo Desir'd us to make stand
His hour is almost past
And it is marvel he out dwells his hour For lovers ever run before the clock
That ever holds who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down
Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first
All things that are Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd
How like a younger or a prodigal The scarfed bark puts from her native bay Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind
How like a prodigal doth she return With over weather'd ribs and ragged sails Lean rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind
Here comes Lorenzo more of this hereafter
Sweet friends your patience for my long abode Not I but my affairs have made you wait When you shall please to play the thieves for wives I'll watch as long for you then Approach Here dwells my father Jew Ho
who's within
Who are you
Tell me for more certainty Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue
Lorenzo and thy love
Lorenzo certain and my love indeed For who love I so much
And now who knows But you Lorenzo whether I am yours
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
Here catch this casket it is worth the pains
I am glad 'tis night you do not look on me For I am much asham'd of my exchange But love is blind and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit For if they could Cupid himself would blush To see me thus transformed to a boy
Descend for you must be my torchbearer
They in themselves good sooth are too too light
Why 'tis an office of discovery love And I should be obscur'd
So are you sweet Even in the lovely garnish of a boy
But come at once For the close night doth play the run away And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats and be with you straight
Now by my hood a Gentile and no Jew
Beshrew me but I love her heartily For she is wise if I can judge of her And fair she is if that mine eyes be true And true she is as she hath prov'd herself And therefore like herself wise fair and true Shall she be placed in my constant soul
Who's there
Signior Antonio
where are all the rest
I am glad on't I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone to night
The one of them contains my picture prince If you choose that then I am yours withal
Some god direct my judgment
Let me see
for lead
hazard for lead
This casket threatens Men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead
What says the silver with her virgin hue
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves
What if I strayed no further but chose here  Let's see once more this saying grav'd in gold Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire
One of these three contains her heavenly picture
Is't like that lead contains her
Twere damnation To think so base a thought it were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
Or shall I think in silver she's immur'd Being ten times undervalued to tried gold
O sinful thought
Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold
There take it prince and if my form lie there Then I am yours
He unlocks the golden casket] [He unlocks the golden casket] O hell
what have we here
A carrion Death within whose empty eye There is a written scroll
I'll read the writing
All that glisters is not gold Often have you heard that told Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold Gilded tombs do worms enfold
Why man I saw Bassanio under sail With him is Gratiano gone along And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not
the law
my ducats and my daughter
A sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats Of double ducats stol'n from me by my daughter
find the girl
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear Yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return he answer'd Do not so Slubber not business for my sake Bassanio But stay the very riping of the time And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me Let it not enter in your mind of love Be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts To courtship and such fair ostents of love As shall conveniently become you there And even there his eye being big with tears Turning his face he put his hand behind him And with affection wondrous sensible He wrung Bassanio's hand and so they parted
I think he only loves the world for him
I pray thee let us go and find him out And quicken his embraced heaviness With some delight or other
Do we so
Now what news on the Rialto
Why yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrack'd on the narrow seas the Goodwins I think they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband
But it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the honest Antonio O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company  Come the full stop
I would it might prove the end of his losses
what news among the merchants
You knew none so well none so well as you of my daughter's flight
And Shylock for his own part knew the bird was fledged and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam
She is damn'd for it
That's certain if the devil may be her judge
My own flesh and blood to rebel
Out upon it old carrion
rebels it at these years
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood
To bait fish withal if it will feed nothing else it will feed my revenge
If you prick us do we not bleed
if you tickle us do we not laugh
if you poison us do we not die
and if you wrong us shall we not revenge
If we are like you in the rest we will resemble you in that
If a Jew wrong a Christian what is his humility
revenge
If a Christian wrong a Jew what should his sufferance be by Christian example
why revenge
The villany you teach me I will execute and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction
Gentlemen my master Antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both
We have been up and down to seek him
Here comes another of the tribe a third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew
hast thou found my daughter
I often came where I did hear of her but cannot find her
Why there there there there
a diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort
would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin
Why thou loss upon loss
the thief gone with so much and so much to find the thief and no satisfaction no revenge nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o' my shoulders no sighs but o' my breathing no tears but o' my shedding
Yes other men have ill luck too
Antonio as I heard in Genoa  What what what
ill luck ill luck
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis
is it true
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack
ha Where
in Genoa
Your daughter spent in Genoa as I heard one night fourscore ducats
fourscore ducats
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break
I am very glad of it I'll plague him I'll torture Him I am glad of it
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey
Out upon her
Thou torturest me Tubal it was my turquoise I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys
But Antonio is certainly undone
Nay that's true that's very true
Go Tubal fee me an officer bespeak him a fortnight before I will have the heart of him if he forfeit forwere he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will
Go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue go good Tubal at our synagogue Tubal
I could teach you How to choose right but then I am forsworn So will I never be so may you miss me But if you do you'll make me wish a sin That I had been forsworn
Beshrew your eyes They have o'erlook'd me and divided me One half of me is yours the other half yours  Mine own I would say but if mine then yours And so all yours O
Let me choose For as I am I live upon the rack
Upon the rack Bassanio
then confess What treason there is mingled with your love
None but that ugly treason of mistrust Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love
Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything
Well then confess and live
Confess and love Had been the very sum of my confession O happy torment when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance
But let me to my fortune and the caskets
He may win And what is music then
Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new crowned monarch such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear And summon him to marriage
Now he goes With no less presence but with much more love Than young Alcides when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the sea monster I stand for sacrifice The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of the exploit
Go Hercules
Tell me where is fancy bred Or in the heart or in the head
How begot how nourished
Ding dong bell
So may the outward shows be least themselves The world is still deceiv'd with ornament
In law what plea so tainted and corrupt But being season'd with a gracious voice Obscures the show of evil
In religion What damned error but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text Hiding the grossness with fair ornament
There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest
How all the other passions fleet to air As doubtful thoughts and rash embrac'd despair And shudd'ring fear and green eyed jealousy
O Love be moderate
What find I here
Fair Portia's counterfeit
What demi god Hath come so near creation
Move these eyes
Here in her hairs The painter plays the spider and hath woven A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes  How could he see to do them
You that choose not by the view Chance as fair and choose as true
Since this fortune falls to you Be content and seek no new
If you be well pleas'd with this And hold your fortune for your bliss Turn you where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss
A gentle scroll Fair lady by your leave I come by note to give and to receive
Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes Hearing applause and universal shout Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise be his or no So thrice fair lady stand I even so As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirm'd sign'd ratified by you
Madam you have bereft me of all words Only my blood speaks to you in my veins And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude Where every something being blent together Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy Express'd and not express'd
But when this ring Parts from this finger then parts life from hence O then be bold to say Bassanio's dead
My lord and lady it is now our time That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper To cry good joy Good joy my lord and lady
My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady I wish you all the joy that you can wish For I am sure you can wish none from me And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too
With all my heart so thou canst get a wife
I thank your lordship you have got me one
Your fortune stood upon the caskets there And so did mine too as the matter falls For wooing here until I sweat again And swearing until my very roof was dry With oaths of love at last if promise last  I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love provided that your fortune Achiev'd her mistress
Is this true Nerissa
Madam it is so you stand pleas'd withal
And do you Gratiano mean good faith
Yes faith my lord
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats
No we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down
But who comes here
Lorenzo and his infidel
What and my old Venetian friend Salerio
So do I my lord
They are entirely welcome
I thank your honour For my part my lord My purpose was not to have seen you here But meeting with Salerio by the way He did entreat me past all saying nay To come with him along
I did my lord And I have reason for it
Signior Antonio Commends him to you
Ere I ope his letter I pray you tell me how my good friend doth
Not sick my lord unless it be in mind Nor well unless in mind his letter there Will show you his estate
Nerissa cheer yon stranger bid her welcome
Your hand Salerio
What's the news from Venice
How doth that royal merchant good Antonio
I know he will be glad of our success We are the Jasons we have won the fleece
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek Some dear friend dead else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man
When I told you My state was nothing I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing for indeed I have engag'd myself to a dear friend Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means
Here is a letter lady The paper as the body of my friend And every word in it a gaping wound Issuing life blood
But is it true Salerio
Have all his ventures fail'd
What not one hit
From Tripolis from Mexico and England From Lisbon Barbary and India
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch Of merchant marring rocks
Not one my lord
Besides it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew He would not take it
When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonio's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him and I know my lord If law authority and power deny not It will go hard with poor Antonio
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
The dearest friend to me the kindest man The best condition'd and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy
What sum owes he the Jew
For me three thousand ducats
What no more
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond Double six thousand and then treble that Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault
First go with me to church and call me wife And then away to Venice to your friend For never shall you lie by Portia's side With an unquiet soul
But let me hear the letter of your friend
Reads] Sweet Bassanio my ships have all Reads] miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible I should live all debts are cleared between you and I if I might but see you at my death Notwithstanding use your pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter
Since I have your good leave to go away I will make haste but till I come again No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay Nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain
Gaoler look to him
tell not me of mercy  This is the fool that lent out money gratis  Gaoler look to him
Hear me yet good Shylock
I pray thee hear me speak
I'll not be made a soft and dull ey'd fool To shake the head relent and sigh and yield To Christian intercessors
Follow not I'll have no speaking I will have my bond
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men
Let him alone I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers
I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold
The Duke cannot deny the course of law For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice if it be denied 'Twill much impeach the justice of the state Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations
Therefore go These griefs and losses have so 'bated me That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh To morrow to my bloody creditor
Well gaoler on Pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt and then I care not
Madam although I speak it in your presence You have a noble and a true conceit Of god like amity which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord
But if you knew to whom you show this honour How true a gentleman you send relief How dear a lover of my lord your husband I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you
I never did repent for doing good Nor shall not now for in companions That do converse and waste the time together Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments of manners and of spirit Which makes me think that this Antonio Being the bosom lover of my lord Must needs be like my lord
If it be so How little is the cost I have bestow'd In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty
This comes too near the praising of myself Therefore no more of it hear other things
I do desire you Not to deny this imposition The which my love and some necessity Now lays upon you
Madam with all my heart I shall obey you in all fair commands
My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself
So fare you well till we shall meet again
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
I wish your ladyship all heart's content
Madam I go with all convenient speed
Come on Nerissa I have work in hand That you yet know not of we'll see our husbands Before they think of us
Shall they see us
They shall Nerissa but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack
Why shall we turn to men
But come I'll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach which stays for us At the park gate and therefore haste away For we must measure twenty miles to day
Yes truly for look you the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children therefore I promise you I fear you
I was always plain with you and so now I speak my agitation of the matter therefore be of good chee for truly I think you are damned
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither
And what hope is that I pray thee
Marry you may partly hope that your father got you not that you are not the Jew's daughter
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I fall into Charybdis your mother well you are gone both ways
I shall be saved by my husband he hath made me a Christian
I'll tell my husband Launcelot what you say here he comes
I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if you thus get my wife into corners
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro's belly the Moor is with child by you Launcelot
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than I took her for
How every fool can play upon the word
That is done sir they have all stomachs
Goodly Lord what a wit snapper are you
then bid them prepare dinner
That is done too sir only cover is the word
Will you cover then sir
Not so sir neither I know my duty
Yet more quarrelling with occasion
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant
I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinner
For the table sir it shall be served in for the meat sir it shall be covered for your coming into dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall govern
O dear discretion how his words are suited
The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words and I do know A many fools that stand in better place Garnish'd like him that for a tricksy word Defy the matter
How cheer'st thou Jessica
And now good sweet say thy opinion  How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife
Past all expressing
It is very meet The Lord Bassanio live an upright life For having such a blessing in his lady He finds the joys of heaven here on earth And if on earth he do not mean it then In reason he should never come to heaven
Why if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women And Portia one there must be something else Pawn'd with the other for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow
Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife
Nay but ask my opinion too of that
I will anon first let us go to dinner
Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach
No pray thee let it serve for table talk Then howso'er thou speak'st 'mong other things I shall digest it
Well I'll set you forth
What is Antonio here
Ready so please your grace
I am sorry for thee thou art come to answer A stony adversary an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity void and empty From any dram of mercy
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach I do oppose My patience to his fury and am arm'd To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his
Go one and call the Jew into the court
He is ready at the door he comes my lord
Make room and let him stand before our face
Shylock the world thinks and I think so too That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act and then 'tis thought Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty And where thou now exact'st the penalty (Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh) Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture But touch'd with human gentleness and love Forgive a moiety of the principal Glancing an eye of pity on his losses That have of late so huddled on his back Enough to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint From stubborn Turks and Tartars never train'd To offices of tender courtesy
We all expect a gentle answer Jew
You'll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats I'll not answer that But say it is my humour
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats To have it ban'd
What are you answer'd yet
Some men there are love not a gaping pig Some that are mad if they behold a cat And others when the bagpipe sings i' the nose Cannot contain their urine for affection Master of passion sways it to the mood Of what it likes or loathes
Are you answer'd
This is no answer thou unfeeling man To excuse the current of thy cruelty
I am not bound to please thee with my answers
Do all men kill the things they do not love
Hates any man the thing he would not kill
Every offence is not a hate at first
For thy three thousand ducats here is six
If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts and every part a ducat I would not draw them I would have my bond
How shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none
What judgment shall I dread doing no wrong
let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be season'd with such viands
Upon my power I may dismiss this court Unless Bellario a learned doctor Whom I have sent for to determine this Come here to day
My lord here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor New come from Padua
Good cheer Antonio
The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
Came you from Padua from Bellario
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew Thou mak'st thy knife keen but no metal can No not the hangman's axe bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy
Can no prayers pierce thee
No none that thou hast wit enough to make
O be thou damn'd inexecrable dog
And for thy life let justice be accus'd
Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith To hold opinion with Pythagoras That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men thy currish spirit Govern'd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet And whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam Infus'd itself in thee for thy desires Are wolvish bloody sterved and ravenous
He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you'll admit him
I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for I never knew so young a body with so old a head
Come you from old Bellario
I did my lord
You are welcome take your place
Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court
I am informed thoroughly of the cause
Which is the merchant here and which the Jew
Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth
Is your name Shylock
Shylock is my name
Ay so he says
Do you confess the bond
I do
Then must the Jew be merciful
On what compulsion must I
tell me that
Therefore Jew Though justice be thy plea consider this  That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation we do pray for mercy And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy
I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there
My deeds upon my head
I crave the law The penalty and forfeit of my bond
Is he not able to discharge the money
Yes here I tender it for him in the court Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er On forfeit of my hands my head my heart If this will not suffice it must appear That malice bears down truth
And I beseech you Wrest once the law to your authority To do a great right do a little wrong And curb this cruel devil of his will
A Daniel come to judgment
yea a Daniel
O wise young judge how I do honour thee
I pray you let me look upon the bond
Here 'tis most reverend doctor here it is
Shylock there's thrice thy money offer'd thee
No not for Venice
When it is paid according to the tenor
Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment
Why then thus it is You must prepare your bosom for his knife
O noble judge
O excellent young man
How much more elder art thou than thy looks
Therefore lay bare your bosom
It is so
Are there balance here to weigh The flesh
I have them ready
Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
Is it so nominated in the bond
It is not so express'd but what of that
Twere good you do so much for charity
I cannot find it 'tis not in the bond
Come merchant have you any thing to say
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom it is still her use To let the wretched man out live his wealth To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty from which lingering penance Of such misery doth she cut me off
Commend me to your honourable wife Tell her the process of Antonio's end Say how I lov'd you speak me fair in death And when the tale is told bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love
Repent not you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt For if the Jew do cut but deep enough I'll pay it instantly with all my heart
Antonio I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself But life itself my wife and all the world Are not with me esteem'd above thy life I would lose all ay sacrifice them all Here to this devil to deliver you
Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer
I have a wife whom I protest I love I would she were in heaven so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew
Tis well you offer it behind her back The wish would make else an unquiet house
We trifle time I pray thee pursue sentence
Most rightful judge
come prepare
Is that the law
Thyself shalt see the act For as thou urgest justice be assur'd Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest
I take this offer then pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go
Here is the money
O Jew
an upright judge a learned judge
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh if thou tak'st more Or less than a just pound be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair  Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
A second Daniel a Daniel Jew
Now infidel I have thee on the hip
Why doth the Jew pause
take thy forfeiture
Give me my principal and let me go
I have it ready for thee here it is
He hath refus'd it in the open court He shall have merely justice and his bond
Shall I not have barely my principal
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril Jew
Why then the devil give him good of it
I'll stay no longer question
It is enacted in the laws of Venice  If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state And the offender's life lies in the mercy Of the duke only 'gainst all other voice
In which predicament I say thou stand'st For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly and directly too Thou hast contriv'd against the very life Of the defendant and thou hast incurr'd The danger formerly by me rehears'd
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state Thou hast not left the value of a cord Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge
Ay for the state not for Antonio
Nay take my life and all pardon not that You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house you take my life When you do take the means whereby I live
What mercy can you render him Antonio
A halter gratis nothing else for God's sake
So please my lord the duke and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter Two things provided more that for this favour He presently become a Christian The other that he do record a gift Here in the court of all he dies possess'd Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter
He shall do this or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here
Art thou contented Jew
what dost thou say
I am content
Clerk draw a deed of gift
I pray you give me leave to go from hence I am not well send the deed after me And I will sign it
Get thee gone but do it
In christening shalt thou have two god fathers Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more To bring thee to the gallows not the font
Sir I entreat you home with me to dinner
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not
Antonio gratify this gentleman For in my mind you are much bound to him
Most worthy gentleman I and my friend Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted Of grievous penalties in lieu whereof Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew We freely cope your courteous pains withal
And stand indebted over and above In love and service to you evermore
He is well paid that is well satisfied And I delivering you am satisfied And therein do account myself well paid My mind was never yet more mercenary
I pray you know me when we meet again I wish you well and so I take my leave
You press me far and therefore I will yield
I will have nothing else but only this And now methinks I have a mind to it
There's more depends on this than on the value
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you And find it out by proclamation Only for this I pray you pardon me
I see sir you are liberal in offers You taught me first to beg and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd
Good sir this ring was given me by my wife And when she put it on she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts
An if your wife be not a mad woman And know how well I have deserv'd the ring She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me
Well peace be with you
My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment
Go Gratiano run and overtake him Give him the ring and bring him if thou canst Unto Antonio's house away
Inquire the Jew's house out give him this deed And let him sign it we'll away to night And be a day before our husbands home
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo
Fair sir you are well o'erta'en My Lord Bassanio upon more advice Hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat Your company at dinner
That cannot be His ring I do accept most thankfully And so I pray you tell him furthermore I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house
That will I do
Thou may'st I warrant we shall have old swearing That they did give the rings away to men But we'll outface them and outswear them too
Away
make haste thou know'st where I will tarry
Come good sir will you show me to this house
The moon shines bright in such a night as this When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night
In such a night Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew And saw the lion's shadow ere himself And ran dismay'd away
In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love To come again to Carthage
In such a night Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs That did renew old Æson
In such a night Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew And with an unthrift love did run from Venice As far as Belmont
In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well Stealing her soul with many vows of faith And ne'er a true one
In such a night Did pretty Jessica like a little shrew Slander her love and he forgave it her
I would out night you did no body come But hark I hear the footing of a man
Who comes so fast in silence of the night
A friend
A friend
what friend
your name I pray you friend
Stephano is my name and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont she doth stray about By holy crosses where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours
Who comes with her
None but a holy hermit and her maid
I pray you is my master yet return'd
Sola sola
wo ha ho
sola sola
Who calls
Sola
sola sola
Sola
Where
where
Here
Tell him there's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news my master will be here ere morning
My friend Stephano signify I pray you Within the house your mistress is at hand And bring your music forth into the air
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony
and wake Diana with a hymn With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear And draw her home with music
I am never merry when I hear sweet music
The man that hath no music in himself Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils The motions of his spirit are dull as night And his affections dark as Erebus Let no such man be trusted Mark the music
So shines a good deed in a naughty world
When the moon shone we did not see the candle
So doth the greater glory dim the less A substitute shines brightly as a king Unto the king be by and then his state Empties itself as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters
Music
hark
It is your music madam of the house
Nothing is good I see without respect Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
Silence bestows that virtue on it madam
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended and I think The nightingale if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling would be thought No better a musician than the wren
the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awak'd
That is the voice Or I am much deceiv'd of Portia
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo By the bad voice
Dear lady welcome home
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare Which speed we hope the better for our words
Are they return'd
Madam they are not yet But there is come a messenger before To signify their coming
Go in Nerissa Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence Nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you
We should hold day with the Antipodes If you would walk in absence of the sun
I thank you madam Give welcome to my friend  This is the man this is Antonio To whom I am so infinitely bound
No more than I am well acquitted of
A quarrel ho already
what's the matter
You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death And that it should lie with you in your grave Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths You should have been respective and have kept it
Gave it a judge's clerk no God's my judge
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it
He will an if he live to be a man
Ay if a woman live to be a man
Now by this hand I gave it to a youth  A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy No higher than thyself the judge's clerk A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee I could not for my heart deny it him
You were to blame I must be plain with you To part so slightly with your wife's first gift A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it and here he stands  I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters
Now in faith Gratiano You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief An 'twere to me I should be mad at it
Why I were best to cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending it
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed Deserv'd it too and then the boy his clerk That took some pains in writing he begg'd mine And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings
What ring gave you my lord
Not that I hope which you receiv'd of me
If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it it is gone
Nor I in yours Till I again see mine
Sweet Portia If you did know to whom I gave the ring If you did know for whom I gave the ring And would conceive for what I gave the ring And how unwillingly I left the ring When nought would be accepted but the ring You would abate the strength of your displeasure
If you had known the virtue of the ring Or half her worthiness that gave the ring Or your own honour to contain the ring You would not then have parted with the ring
What man is there so much unreasonable If you had pleas'd to have defended it With any terms of zeal wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony
Nerissa teaches me what to believe I'll die for't but some woman had the ring
No by mine honour madam by my soul No woman had it but a civil doctor Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me And begg'd the ring the which I did deny him And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away Even he that had uphold the very life Of my dear friend
What should I say sweet lady
I was enforc'd to send it after him I was beset with shame and courtesy My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it
Pardon me good lady For by these blessed candles of the night Had you been there I think you would have begg'd The ring of me to give the worthy doctor
And I his clerk therefore be well advis'd How you do leave me to mine own protection
Well do you so let not me take him then For if I do I'll mar the young clerk's pen
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels
Sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding
Portia forgive me this enforced wrong And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself  Mark you but that
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself In each eye one swear by your double self And there's an oath of credit
Nay but hear me Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee
Then you shall be his surety
Give him this And bid him keep it better than the other
Here Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring
I had it of him pardon me Bassanio For by this ring the doctor lay with me
And pardon me my gentle Gratiano For that same scrubbed boy the doctor's clerk In lieu of this last night did lie with me
are we cuckolds ere we have deserv'd it
I am dumb
Were you the doctor and I knew you not
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
Ay but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he live until he be a man
Sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow When I am absent then lie with my wife
Sweet lady you have given me life and living For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road
How now Lorenzo
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you
Fair ladies you drop manna in the way Of starved people
It is almost morning And yet I am sure you are not satisfied Of these events at full
Let us go in And charge us there upon inter'gatories And we will answer all things faithfully
Well while I live I'll fear no other thing So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring
Now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour Draws on apace four happy days bring in Another moon but O methinks how slow This old moon wanes
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night Four nights will quickly dream away the time And then the moon like to a silver bow New bent in heaven shall behold the night Of our solemnities
Go Philostrate Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth Turn melancholy forth to funerals The pale companion is not for our pomp
Hippolyta I woo'd thee with my sword And won thy love doing thee injuries But I will wed thee in another key With pomp with triumph and with revelling
Happy be Theseus our renowned duke
And my gracious duke Be it so she will not here before your Grace Consent to marry with Demetrius I beg the ancient privilege of Athens As she is mine I may dispose of her Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death according to our law Immediately provided in that case
What say you Hermia
Be advis'd fair maid
To you your father should be as a god One that composed your beauties yea and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman
So is Lysander
In himself he is But in this kind wanting your father's voice The other must be held the worthier
I would my father look'd but with my eyes
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look
I do entreat your Grace to pardon me
Either to die the death or to abjure For ever the society of men
Therefore fair Hermia question your desires Know of your youth examine well your blood Whether if you yield not to your father's choice You can endure the livery of a nun For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd To live a barren sister all your life Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
Thrice blessed they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd Than that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows lives and dies in single blessedness
So will I grow so live so die my lord Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty
Take time to pause and by the next new moon  The sealing day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship  Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father's will Or else to wed Demetrius as he would Or on Diana's altar to protest For aye austerity and single life
Relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield Thy crazed title to my certain right
Scornful Lysander
True he hath my love And what is mine my love shall render him And she is mine and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius
I am my lord as well derived as he As well possess'd my love is more than his My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd If not with vantage as Demetrius' And which is more than all these boasts can be I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia
Why should not I then prosecute my right
Demetrius I'll avouch it to his head Made love to Nedar's daughter Helena And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry Upon this spotted and inconstant man
Come my Hippolyta what cheer my love
Demetrius and Egeus go along I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves
With duty and desire we follow you
How now my love
Why is your cheek so pale
How chance the roses there do fade so fast
Ay me
too high to be enthrall'd to low
Or else misgraffed in respect of years  O spite
too old to be engag'd to young
to choose love by another's eyes
A good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia
There gentle Hermia may I marry thee And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us
If thou lovest me then Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night And in the wood a league without the town Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May There will I stay for thee
My good Lysander
I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow By his best arrow with the golden head By the simplicity of Venus' doves By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queen When the false Trojan under sail was seen By all the vows that ever men have broke In number more than ever women spoke In that same place thou hast appointed me Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee
Keep promise love
Look here comes Helena
God speed fair Helena
Whither away
Were the world mine Demetrius being bated The rest I'd give to be to you translated
O teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart
I frown upon him yet he loves me still
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
I give him curses yet he gives me love
O that my prayers could such affection move
The more I hate the more he follows me
The more I love the more he hateth me
His folly Helena is no fault of mine
Take comfort he no more shall see my face Lysander and myself will fly this place
Before the time I did Lysander see Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me
O then what graces in my love do dwell That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell
Keep word Lysander we must starve our sight From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight
I will my Hermia
How happy some o'er other some can be
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she
But what of that
Demetrius thinks not so He will not know what all but he do know
Things base and vile holding no quantity Love can transpose to form and dignity
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear So the boy Love is perjured everywhere For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt So he dissolv'd and showers of oaths did melt
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her and for this intelligence If I have thanks it is a dear expense
But herein mean I to enrich my pain To have his sight thither and back again
Is all our company here
You were best to call them generally man by man according to the scrip
Here is the scroll of every man's name which is thought fit through all Athens to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess on his wedding day at night
First good Peter Quince say what the play treats on then read the names of the actors and so grow to a point
Marry our play is The Most Lamentable Comedy and Most Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisbe
Masters spread yourselves
Ready
Name what part I am for and proceed
You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus
What is Pyramus
A lover or a tyrant
A lover that kills himself most gallant for love
That will ask some tears in the true performing of it
If I do it let the audience look to their eyes I will move storms I will condole in some measure
Francis Flute the bellows mender
Here Peter Quince
Flute you must take Thisbe on you
What is Thisbe
A wandering knight
It is the lady that Pyramus must love
Nay faith let not me play a woman I have a beard coming
That's all one you shall play it in a mask and you may speak as small as you will
An I may hide my face let me play Thisbe too
Well proceed
Robin Starveling the tailor
Here Peter Quince
Here Peter Quince
Have you the lion's part written
Pray you if it be give it me for I am slow of study
You may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring
Let me play the lion too
I will roar that I will do any man's heart good to hear me I will roar that I will make the duke say ‘Let him roar again let him roar again’ An you should do it too terribly you would fright the duchess and the ladies that they would shriek and that were enough to hang us all
That would hang us every mother's son
You can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a sweet faced man a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day a most lovely gentleman like man therefore you must needs play Pyramus
Well I will undertake it
What beard were I best to play it in
Why what you will
I will discharge it in either your straw color beard your orange tawny beard your purple in grain beard or your French crown color beard your perfect yellow
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all and then you will play barefaced
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants
I pray you fail me not
We will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously
Take pains be perfect adieu
At the duke's oak we meet
Enough hold or cut bow strings
How now spirit
whither wander you
Over hill over dale Thorough bush thorough brier Over park over pale Thorough flood thorough fire I do wander every where Swifter than the moon's sphere And I serve the fairy queen To dew her orbs upon the green
Farewell thou lob of spirits I'll be gone
Our queen and all her elves come here anon
The king doth keep his revels here tonight Take heed the queen come not within his sight For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king
And now they never meet in grove or green By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen But they do square that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups and hide them there
Are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery Skim milk and sometimes labor in the quern And bootless make the breathless housewife churn And sometime make the drink to bear no barm Mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck You do their work and they shall have good luck
Thou speakest aright I am that merry wanderer of the night
I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean fed horse beguile Neighing in likeness of a filly foal And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab And when she drinks against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale
Ill met by moonlight proud Titania
What jealous Oberon
Fairies skip hence I have forsworn his bed and company
Tarry rash wanton am not I thy lord
Then I must be thy lady but I know When thou hast stolen away from fairy land And in the shape of Corin sat all day Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida
How canst thou thus for shame Titania Glance at my credit with Hippolyta Knowing I know thy love to Theseus
Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna whom he ravished
And make him with fair Aegle break his faith With Ariadne and Antiopa
Therefore the winds piping to us in vain As in revenge have suck'd up from the sea Contagious fogs which falling in the land Hath every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents
The human mortals want their winter here No night is now with hymn or carol blest Therefore the moon the governess of floods Pale in her anger washes all the air That rheumatic diseases do abound
And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter hoary headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is as in mockery set
The spring the summer The childing autumn angry winter change Their wonted liveries and the mazed world By their increase now knows not which is which
Do you amend it then it lies in you
Why should Titania cross her Oberon
But she being mortal of that boy did die And for her sake do I rear up her boy And for her sake I will not part with him
How long within this wood intend you stay
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding day
If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels go with us If not shun me and I will spare your haunts
Give me that boy and I will go with thee
Not for thy fairy kingdom
Fairies away
We shall chide downright if I longer stay
My gentle Puck come hither
Thou rememberest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea maid's music
I remember
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell
The juice of it on sleeping eye lids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees
Fetch me this herb and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league
I'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes
And ere I take this charm from off her sight As I can take it with another herb I'll make her render up her page to me
But who comes here
I am invisible And I will overhear their conference
I love thee not therefore pursue me not
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia
The one I'll slay the other slayeth me
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood And here am I and wood within this wood Because I cannot meet my Hermia
Hence get thee gone and follow me no more
Leave you your power to draw And I shall have no power to follow you
Do I entice you
Do I speak you fair
Or rather do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you
And even for that do I love you the more
I am your spaniel and Demetrius The more you beat me I will fawn on you
What worser place can I beg in your love  And yet a place of high respect with me  Than to be used as you use your dog
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit For I am sick when I do look on thee
And I am sick when I look not on you
You do impeach your modesty too much To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity
Your virtue is my privilege
For that It is not night when I do see your face Therefore I think I am not in the night Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company For you in my respect are all the world
Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
Run when you will the story shall be changed Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed When cowardice pursues and valour flies
Ay in the temple in the town the field You do me mischief
Fie Demetrius
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell To die upon the hand I love so well
Welcome wanderer
Ay there it is
I pray thee give it me
Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on
Effect it with some care that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
Fear not my lord your servant shall do so
Come now a roundel and a fairy song Then for the third part of a minute hence Some to kill cankers in the musk rose buds Some war with rere mice for their leathern wings To make my small elves coats and some keep back The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders At our quaint spirits
Sing me now asleep Then to your offices and let me rest
song] You spotted snakes with double tongue Thorny hedgehogs be not seen Newts and blind worms do no wrong Come not near our fairy Queen
Philomel with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby
Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
Philomel with melody &ampc Hence away now all is well
One aloof stand sentinel
Wake when some vile thing is near
Fair love you faint with wandering in the wood And to speak troth I have forgot our way We'll rest us Hermia if you think it good And tarry for the comfort of the day
Be it so Lysander find you out a bed For I upon this bank will rest my head
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
O take the sense sweet of my innocence
Love takes the meaning in love's conference
Then by your side no bed room me deny For lying so Hermia I do not lie
Lysander riddles very prettily
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end
Amen amen to that fair prayer say I And then end life when I end loyalty
Through the forest have I gone But Athenian found I none On whose eyes I might approve This flower's force in stirring love
Pretty soul
she durst not lie Near this lack love this kill courtesy
So awake when I am gone For I must now to Oberon
Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius
I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
O wilt thou darkling leave me
Do not so
Stay on thy peril I alone will go
O I am out of breath in this fond chase
The more my prayer the lesser is my grace
Happy is Hermia wheresoe'er she lies For she hath blessed and attractive eyes
How came her eyes so bright
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne
But who is here
on the ground
I see no blood no wound
Lysander if you live good sir awake
Waking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake
Transparent Helena
Nature shows art That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
Where is Demetrius
O how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword
Do not say so Lysander say not so
What though he love your Hermia
Lord what though
Content with Hermia
The will of man is by his reason sway'd And reason says you are the worthier maid
Things growing are not ripe until their season So I being young till now ripe not to reason And touching now the point of human skill Reason becomes the marshal to my will And leads me to your eyes where I o'erlook Love's stories written in Love's richest book
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn
Is't not enough is't not enough young man That I did never no nor never can Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye But you must flout my insufficiency
Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do In such disdainful manner me to woo
O that a lady of one man refused Should of another therefore be abused
Lysander look how I do quake with fear
What removed
Lysander
lord
What out of hearing
gone
No sound no word
Alack where are you
Speak an if you hear Speak of all loves
I swoon almost with fear
Then I well perceive you are not nigh
Either death or you I'll find immediately
Are we all met
Pat pat and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal
This green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn brake our tiring house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the Duke
Peter Quince  What sayest thou bully Bottom
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please
First Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot abide
How answer you that
By'r lakin a parlous fear
I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done
This will put them out of fear
No make it two more let it be written in eight and eight
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion
I fear it I promise you
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion
Nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect  ‘Ladies’  or ‘Fair ladies I would wish you’ or ‘I would request you’  or ‘I would entreat you not to fear not to tremble
My life for yours
If you think I come hither as a lion it were pity of my life
Well it shall be so
But there is two hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play
A calendar a calendar
Yes it doth shine that night
Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement
Ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of moonshine
Some man or other must present Wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough cast about him to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper
If that may be then all is well
Come sit down every mother's son and rehearse your parts
What hempen home spuns have we swagg'ring here So near the cradle of the fairy queen
What a play toward
I'll be an auditor An actor too perhaps if I see cause
Must I speak now
Ay marry must you for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again
You speak all your part at once cues and all
O strange
We are haunted
fly masters
Help
I'll follow you I'll lead you about a round Through bog through bush through brake through brier Sometime a horse I'll be sometime a hound A hog a headless bear sometime a fire And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn
Why do they run away
This is a knavery of them to make me afeard
O Bottom thou art changed
What do I see on thee
What do you see
You see an ass head of your own do you
I see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could
The ousel cock so black of hue With orange tawny bill The throstle with his note so true The wren with little quill
Awakening] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed
Mine ear is much enamored of thy note So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me On the first view to say to swear I love thee
The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends
Nay I can gleek upon occasion
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
I am a spirit of no common rate The summer still doth tend upon my state And I do love thee therefore go with me
Moth
and Mustardseed
Ready
And I
And I
And I
Where shall we go
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes Feed him with apricocks and dewberries With purple grapes green figs and mulberries The honey bags steal from the humble bees And for night tapers crop their waxen thighs And light them at the fiery glow worm's eyes To have my love to bed and to arise And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
Nod to him elves and do him courtesies
Hail mortal
Hail
Hail
Hail
I cry your worships mercy heartily I beseech your worship's name
Cobweb
I shall desire you of more acquaintance good Master Cobweb
Peaseblossom
Mustardseed
Good Master Mustardseed I know your patience well
That same cowardly giant like ox beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now
I desire your more acquaintance good Master Mustardseed
Come wait upon him lead him to my bower
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye And when she weeps weeps every little flower Lamenting some enforced chastity
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently
I wonder if Titania be awaked Then what it was that next came in her eye Which she must dote on in extremity
What night rule now about this haunted grove
My mistress with a monster is in love
Near to her close and consecrated bower While she was in her dull and sleeping hour A crew of patches rude mechanicals That work for bread upon Athenian stalls Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day
The shallowest thick skin of that barren sort Who Pyramus presented in their sport Forsook his scene and ent'red in a brake When I did him at this advantage take An ass's nole I fixed on his head
Anon his Thisbe must be answered And forth my mimic comes
Their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong Made senseless things begin to do them wrong For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch Some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch
This falls out better than I could devise
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes With the love juice as I did bid thee do
I took him sleeping that is finish'd too  And the Athenian woman by his side That when he waked of force she must be eyed
Stand close this is the same Athenian
This is the woman but not this the man
O why rebuke you him that loves you so
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
Now I but chide but I should use thee worse For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep Being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep And kill me too
The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me
Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia
I'll believe as soon This whole earth may be bored and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displease Her brother's noontide with the Antipodes
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him So should a murderer look so dead so grim
What's this to my Lysander
Where is he
Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds
Out dog
out cur
Thou drivest me past the bounds Of maiden's patience
Hast thou slain him then
Henceforth be never number'd among men
O once tell true tell true even for my sake
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake And hast thou kill'd him sleeping
O brave touch
Could not a worm an adder do so much
You spend your passion on a misprised mood I am not guilty of Lysander's blood Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell
I pray thee tell me then that he is well
An if I could what should I get therefore
And from thy hated presence part I so See me no more whether he be dead or no
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe Which now in some slight measure it will pay If for his tender here I make some stay
What hast thou done
Thou hast mistaken quite And laid the love juice on some true love's sight
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true
Then fate o'er rules that one man holding troth A million fail confounding oath on oath
I go I go look how I go Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow
Flower of this purple dye Hit with Cupid's archery Sink in apple of his eye
Captain of our fairy band Helena is here at hand And the youth mistook by me Pleading for a lover's fee Shall we their fond pageant see
Lord what fools these mortals be
Stand aside
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn
Scorn and derision never come in tears
Look when I vow I weep and vows so born In their nativity all truth appears
How can these things in me seem scorn to you Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
You do advance your cunning more and more
When truth kills truth O devilish holy fray
These vows are Hermia's
Will you give her o'er
I had no judgment when to her I swore
Nor none in my mind now you give her o'er
Demetrius loves her and he loves not you
To what my love shall I compare thine eyne
Crystal is muddy
O how ripe in show Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
That pure congealed white high Taurus' snow Fann'd with the eastern wind turns to a crow When thou hold'st up thy hand
O let me kiss This princess of pure white this seal of bliss
O spite
O hell
I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment
If you were civil and knew courtesy You would not do me thus much injury
Can you not hate me as I know you do But you must join in souls to mock me too
If you were men as men you are in show You would not use a gentle lady so To vow and swear and superpraise my parts When I am sure you hate me with your hearts
You both are rivals and love Hermia And now both rivals to mock Helena
A trim exploit a manly enterprise To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes With your derision
None of noble sort Would so offend a virgin and extort A poor soul's patience all to make you sport
You are unkind Demetrius be not so For you love Hermia
Never did mockers waste more idle breath
Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none
If e'er I loved her all that love is gone
My heart to her but as guest wise so journ'd And now to Helen is it home return'd There to remain
Helen it is not so
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go
What love could press Lysander from my side
Lysander's love that would not let him bide Fair Helena who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light
Why seek'st thou me
Could not this make thee know The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so
You speak not as you think it cannot be
Lo she is one of this confederacy
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three To fashion this false sport in spite of me
Injurious Hermia
most ungrateful maid
Have you conspired have you with these contrived To bait me with this foul derision
Is all the counsel that we two have shared The sisters' vows the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty footed time For parting us O is all forgot
All school days' friendship childhood innocence
We Hermia like two artificial gods Have with our needles created both one flower Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion Both warbling of one song both in one key As if our hands our sides voices and minds Had been incorporate
And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend
Have you not set Lysander as in scorn To follow me and praise my eyes and face
And made your other love Demetrius Who even but now did spurn me with his foot To call me goddess nymph divine and rare Precious celestial
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love so rich within his soul And tender me forsooth affection But by your setting on by your consent
What though I be not so in grace as you So hung upon with love so fortunate But miserable most to love unloved
This you should pity rather than despise
I understand not what you mean by this
If you have any pity grace or manners You would not make me such an argument
Stay gentle Helena hear my excuse My love my life my soul fair Helena
O excellent
Sweet do not scorn her so
If she cannot entreat I can compel
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers Helen I love thee by my life I do I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not
I say I love thee more than he can do
If thou say so withdraw and prove it too
Away you Ethiope
You are a tame man go
Why are you grown so rude
What change is this Sweet love
Thy love
Out tawny Tartar out
Out loathed medicine
O hated potion hence
Do you not jest
Yes sooth and so do you
Demetrius I will keep my word with thee
I would I had your bond for I perceive A weak bond holds you I'll not trust your word
Although I hate her I'll not harm her so
What
Can you do me greater harm than hate
Hate me
wherefore
O me
what news my love
Am not I Hermia
Are not you Lysander
Why then you left me O the gods forbid  In earnest shall I say
Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt Be certain nothing truer 'tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena
O me
you juggler
you cankerb lossom
You thief of love
What
Have you come by night And stolen my love's heart from him
Fine i' faith
Have you no modesty no maiden shame No touch of bashfulness
What
Will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue
Fie fie
you counterfeit you puppet you
Ay that way goes the game
How low am I thou painted maypole
I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
I pray you though you mock me gentlemen Let her not hurt me
I was never curst I have no gift at all in shrewishness I am a right maid for my cowardice Let her not strike me
You perhaps may think Because she is something lower than myself That I can match her
Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me
I evermore did love you Hermia Did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you Save that in love unto Demetrius I told him of your stealth unto this wood
Let me go
You see how simple and how fond I am
Why get you gone
Who is't that hinders you
A foolish heart that I leave here behind
What
with Lysander
With Demetrius
Be not afraid she shall not harm thee Helena
No sir she shall not though you take her part
Little’ again
Let me come to her
Get you gone you dwarf You minimus of hind'ring knot grass made You bead you acorn
You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services
Follow
Nay I'll go with thee cheek by jowl
You mistress all this coil is 'long of you
Nay go not back
I will not trust you I Nor longer stay in your curst company
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray My legs are longer though to run away
I am amazed and know not what to say
This is thy negligence
Still thou mistakest Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully
Believe me king of shadows I mistook
Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he had on
And so far blameless proves my enterprise That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes And so far am I glad it so did sort As this their jangling I esteem a sport
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight
Hie therefore Robin overcast the night The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another's way
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong And sometime rail thou like Demetrius And from each other look thou lead them thus Till o'er their brows death counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye Whose liquor hath this virtuous property To take from thence all error with his might And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
When they next wake all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision And back to Athens shall the lovers wend With league whose date till death shall never end
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy And then I will her charmed eye release From monster's view and all things shall be peace
My fairy lord this must be done with haste For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger At whose approach ghosts wandering here and there Troop home to churchyards
Up and down up and down I will lead them up and down
I am fear'd in field and town
Goblin lead them up and down
Here comes one
Where art thou proud Demetrius
Speak thou now
Here villain drawn and ready
Where art thou
I will be with thee straight
Follow me then To plainer ground
Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
Speak
In some bush
Where dost thou hide thy head
Thou coward art thou bragging to the stars Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars And wilt not come
Come recreant come thou child I'll whip thee with a rod
He is defiled That draws a sword on thee
Yea art thou there
Follow my voice we'll try no manhood here
He goes before me and still dares me on When I come where he calls then he is gone
Come thou gentle day
For if but once thou show me thy grey light I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite
Ho ho ho
Coward why com'st thou not
Abide me if thou darest for well I wot Thou runnest before me shifting every place And darest not stand nor look me in the face
Where art thou now
Come hither I am here
Nay then thou mock'st me
O weary night O long and tedious night Abate thy hours
Yet but three
Come one more Two of both kinds makes up four
Never so weary never so in woe Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers I can no further crawl no further go My legs can keep no pace with my desires
Here will I rest me till the break of day
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray
Come sit thee down upon this flowery bed While I thy amiable cheeks do coy And stick musk roses in thy sleek smooth head And kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy
Where's Peaseblossom
Ready
Ready
Monsieur Cobweb good monsieur get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red hipped humble bee on the top of a thistle and good monsieur bring me the honey bag
Ready
Give me your neaf Monsieur Mustardseed
Pray you leave your courtesy good monsieur
What's your will
Nothing good monsieur but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch
I must to the barber's monsieur for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face and I am such a tender ass if my hair do but tickle me I must scratch
What wilt thou hear some music my sweet love
I have a reasonable good ear in music
Or say sweet love what thou desirest to eat
Truly a peck of provender I could munch your good dry oats
Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay
Good hay sweet hay hath no fellow
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel's hoard and fetch thee new nuts
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas
But I pray you let none of your people stir me I have an exposition of sleep come upon me
Sleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms
Fairies be gone and be all ways away
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist the female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm
O how I love thee
how I dote on thee
Welcome good Robin
See'st thou this sweet sight
For she his hairy temples then had rounded With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers And that same dew which sometime on the buds Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
When I had at my pleasure taunted her And she in mild terms begg'd my patience I then did ask of her her changeling child Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent To bear him to my bower in fairy land
And now I have the boy I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes
And gentle Puck take this transformed scalp From off the head of this Athenian swain That he awaking when the other do May all to Athens back again repair And think no more of this night's accidents But as the fierce vexation of a dream
But first I will release the fairy queen
Be as thou wast wont to be See as thou was wont to see
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower Hath such force and blessed power
Now my Titania wake you my sweet queen
My Oberon
What visions have I seen
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass
There lies your love
How came these things to pass
Robin take off this head
Titania music call and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense
Now when thou wakest with thine own fool's eyes peep
Sound music
Come my Queen take hands with me And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
Now thou and I are new in amity And will tomorrow midnight solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly And bless it to all fair prosperity
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be Wedded with Theseus all in jollity
Fairy king attend and mark I do hear the morning lark
Then my Queen in silence sad Trip we after night's shade
We the globe can compass soon Swifter than the wandering moon
Come my lord and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground
I was with Hercules and Cadmus once When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear With hounds of Sparta never did I hear Such gallant chiding for besides the groves The skies the fountains every region near Seem'd all one mutual cry
I never heard So musical a discord such sweet thunder
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind So flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew Crook knee'd and dew lapp'd like Thessalian bulls Slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells Each under each
A cry more tuneable Was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly
My lord this is my daughter here asleep And this Lysander this Demetrius is This Helena old Nedar's Helena
I wonder of their being here together
It is my lord
Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
Good morrow friends
Saint Valentine is past Begin these wood birds but to couple now
Pardon my lord
I pray you all stand up
I know you two are rival enemies How comes this gentle concord in the world That hatred is so far from jealousy To sleep by hate and fear no enmity
Our intent Was to be gone from Athens where we might Without the peril of the Athenian law
My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth Of this their purpose hither to this wood And I in fury hither followed them Fair Helena in fancy following me
To her my lord Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia
But like a sickness did I loathe this food But as in health come to my natural taste Now I do wish it love it long for it And will for evermore be true to it
Fair lovers you are fortunately met Of this discourse we more will hear anon
Egeus I will overbear your will For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit
These things seem small and undistinguishable Like far off mountains turned into clouds
Methinks I see these things with parted eye When every thing seems double
Yea and my father
And Hippolyta
And he did bid us follow to the temple
Wakes) When my cue comes call me and I will answer
My next is ‘Most fair Pyramus’ Heigh ho
Peter Quince
Flute the bellows mender
Snout the tinker
Starveling
God's my life stolen hence and left me asleep
I have had a most rare vision
I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was
Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this Methought I was there is no man can tell what dream
Methought I was and methought I had but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had
The eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man's hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was
I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream
It shall be call'd ‘Bottom's Dream’ because it hath no bottom and I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the Duke
Peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it at her death
Have you sent to Bottom's house
Is he come home yet
He cannot be heard of
Out of doubt he is transported
If he come not then the play is marred it goes not forward doth it
It is not possible
You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he
No he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens
You must say ‘paragon’ A paramour is God bless us A thing of naught
Masters the Duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married
If our sport had gone forward we had all been made men
O sweet bully Bottom
He would have deserved it sixpence a day in Pyramus or nothing
Where are these lads
Where are these hearts
O most courageous day
O most happy hour
I will tell you everything right as it fell out
Let us hear sweet Bottom
Not a word of me
All that I will tell you is that the Duke hath dined
Get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look o'er his part for the short and the long is our play is preferred
In any case let Thisbe have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall hang out for the lion's claws
And most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy
No more words
Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak of
More strange than true
I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains Such shaping fantasies that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends
The lunatic the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold That is the madman
The lover all as frantic Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt
The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling Doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown the poet's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name
Such tricks hath strong imagination That if it would but apprehend some joy It comprehends some bringer of that joy Or in the night imagining some fear How easy is a bush supposed a bear
But all the story of the night told over And all their minds transfigured so together More witnesseth than fancy's images And grows to something of great constancy But howsoever strange and admirable
Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
Joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts
More than to us Wait in your royal walks your board your bed
Come now what masques what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after supper and bed time
Where is our usual manager of mirth
What revels are in hand
Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour
Call Philostrate
Say what abridgment have you for this evening
What masque
what music
How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight
There is a brief how many sports are ripe Make choice of which your Highness will see first
tedious and brief
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
How shall we find the concord of this discord
A play there is my lord some ten words long Which is as brief as I have known a play But by ten words my lord it is too long Which makes it tedious for in all the play There is not one word apt one player fitted
What are they that do play it
Hard handed men that work in Athens here Which never labour'd in their minds till now And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptial
And we will hear it
No my noble lord It is not for you
I have heard it over And it is nothing nothing in the world Unless you can find sport in their intents Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain To do you service
I will hear that play For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it
I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged And duty in his service perishing
Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
He says they can do nothing in this kind
The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake And what poor duty cannot do noble respect Takes it in might not merit
Where I have come great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes Where I have seen them shiver and look pale Make periods in the midst of sentences Throttle their practised accent in their fears And in conclusion dumbly have broke off Not paying me a welcome
Trust me sweet Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence
Love therefore and tongue tied simplicity In least speak most to my capacity
So please your Grace the Prologue is address'd
Let him approach
If we offend it is with our good will
That you should think we come not to offend But with good will
To show our simple skill That is the true beginning of our end
Consider then we come but in despite
We do not come as minding to content you Our true intent is
All for your delight We are not here
He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop
Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government
His speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered
Who is next
Gentles perchance you wonder at this show But wonder on till truth make all things plain
This man is Pyramus if you would know This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain
This man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn Presenteth Moonshine for if you will know By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus' tomb there there to woo
This grisly beast which Lion hight by name The trusty Thisbe coming first by night Did scare away or rather did affright And as she fled her mantle she did fall Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
For all the rest Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain At large discourse while here they do remain
I wonder if the lion be to speak
Would you desire lime and hair to speak better
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse my lord
Pyramus draws near the wall silence
O grim look'd night
O night with hue so black
O night which ever art when day is not
Thanks courteous wall
Jove shield thee well for this
But what see I
No Thisbe do I see
O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss Curs'd he thy stones for thus deceiving me
The wall methinks being sensible should curse again
No in truth sir he should not
Deceiving me is Thisbe's cue
She is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall
You shall see it will fall pat as I told you yonder she comes
O wall full often hast thou heard my moans For parting my fair Pyramus and me
I see a voice now will I to the chink To spy an I can hear my Thisbe's face
Thisbe
My love
thou art my love I think
Think what thou wilt I am thy lover's grace And like Limander am I trusty still
And I like Helen till the Fates me kill
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true
As Shafalus to Procrus I to you
O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
I kiss the wall's hole not your lips at all
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway
Tide life 'tide death I come without delay
Thus have I wall my part discharged so And being done thus Wall away doth go
Now is the mural down between the two neighbors
No remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard
The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them
It must be your imagination then and not theirs
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men
Here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion
You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor May now perchance both quake and tremble here When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
A very gentle beast and of a good conscience
The very best at a beast my lord that e'er I saw
This lion is a very fox for his valour
True and a goose for his discretion
Not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose
His discretion I am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox
He is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference
This lanthorn doth the horned moon present Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be
How is it else the man i' the moon
He dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff
I am aweary of this moon
Would he would change
It appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time
Proceed Moon
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I the man i' the moon this thorn bush my thorn bush and this dog my dog
Why all these should be in the lantern for all these are in the moon
But silence here comes Thisbe
This is old Ninny's tomb
Where is my love
Well run Thisbe
Well moused Lion
And then came Pyramus
And so the lion vanished
But stay O spite
But mark poor knight What dreadful dole is here
Eyes do you see
How can it he
O dainty duck
O dear
Thy mantle good What
stain'd with blood
Approach ye Furies fell
O Fates
come come Cut thread and thrum Quail crush conclude and quell
This passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad
Beshrew my heart but I pity the man
O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear Which is no no which was the fairest dame That lived that loved that liked that looked with cheer
Come tears confound Out sword and wound The pap of Pyramus Ay that left pap Where heart doth hop
Thus die I thus thus thus
Now am I dead Now am I fled My soul is in the sky
Now die die die die die
No die but an ace for him for he is but one
Less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass
How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover
A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which Thisbe is the better he for a man God warrant us She for a woman God bless us
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
And thus she moans videlicet  Asleep my love
What dead my dove
O Pyramus arise Speak speak
Quite dumb
Dead dead
A tomb Must cover thy sweet eyes
O Sisters Three Come come to me With hands as pale as milk Lay them in gore Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk
Dies] [Dies] Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead
Ay and Wall too
No I assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers
Will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company
No epilogue I pray you for your play needs no excuse
Never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed
Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter it would have been a fine tragedy
And so it is truly and very notably discharged
But come your Bergomask let your epilogue alone
I fear we shall out sleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatch'd
Through the house give glimmering light By the dead and drowsy fire Every elf and fairy sprite Hop as light as bird from brier And this ditty after me Sing and dance it trippingly
Now until the break of day Through this house each fairy stray
To the best bride bed will we Which by us shall blessed be And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate
Trip away make no stay Meet me all by break of day
If we shadows have offended Think but this and all is mended That you have but slumber'd here While these visions did appear
And this weak and idle theme No more yielding but a dream Gentles do not reprehend
So good night unto you all
Give me your hands if we be friends And Robin shall restore amends
Tush never tell me
I take it much unkindly That thou Iago who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine shouldst know of this
Sblood but you will not hear me
If ever I did dream of such a matter Abhor me
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate
Despise me if I do not
Forsooth a great arithmetician One Michael Cassio a Florentine A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife That never set a squadron in the field Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster unless the bookish theoric Where in the toga'd consuls can propose As masterly as he mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership
By heaven I rather would have been his hangman
Why there's no remedy
Tis the curse of service Preferment goes by letter and affection And not by old gradation where each second Stood heir to the first
Now sir be judge yourself Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor
I would not follow him then
You shall mark Many a duteous and kneecrooking knave That doting on his own obsequious bondage Wears out his time much like his master's ass For naught but provender and when he's old cashier'd
Whip me such honest knaves
Others there are Who trimm'd in forms and visages of duty Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves And throwing but shows of service on their lords Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats Do themselves homage
These fellows have some soul And such a one do I profess myself
For sir It is as sure as you are Roderigo Were I the Moor I would not be Iago
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe If he can carry't thus
Though that his joy be joy Yet throw such changes of vexation on't As it may lose some color
Do with like timorous accent and dire yell As when by night and negligence the fire Is spied in populous cities
What ho Brabantio
Signior Brabantio ho
Awake
What ho Brabantio
thieves
thieves
thieves
Look to your house your daughter and your bags
Thieves
thieves
What is the reason of this terrible summons
What is the matter there
Signior is all your family within
Are your doors lock'd
Arise I say
What have you lost your wits
Most reverend signior do you know my voice
What are you
My name is Roderigo
The worser welcome
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee and now in madness  Being full of supper and distempering draughts  Upon malicious bravery dost thou come To start my quiet
Sir sir sir  But thou must needs be sure My spirit and my place have in them power To make this bitter to thee
Patience good sir
What tell'st thou me of robbing
This is Venice My house is not a grange
Most grave Brabantio In simple and pure soul I come to you
Zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse you'll have your nephews neigh to you you'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans
What profane wretch art thou
I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs
Thou art a villain
You are a senator
Sir I will answer any thing
Give me a taper
Call up all my people
Farewell for I must leave you
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place To be produced as if I stay I shall  Against the Moor
For I do know the state However this may gall him with some check Cannot with safety cast him for he's embark'd With such loud reason to the Cyprus' wars Which even now stands in act that for their souls Another of his fathom they have none To lead their business in which regard Though I do hate him as I do hell pains Yet for necessity of present life I must show out a flag and sign of love Which is indeed but sign
That you shall surely find him Lead to the Sagittary the raised search And there will I be with him
So farewell
How didst thou know 'twas she
Raise all my kindred
Are they married think you
Truly I think they are
O heaven How got she out
O treason of the blood
Fathers from hence trust not your daughters' minds By what you see them act
Have you not read Roderigo Of some such thing
Yes sir I have indeed
Call up my brother
Do you know Where we may apprehend her and the Moor
I think I can discover him if you please To get good guard and go along with me
Pray you lead on
Though in the trade of war I have slain men Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience To do no contrived murder
I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service
Nine or ten times I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs
Tis better as it is
Nay but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That with the little godliness I have I did full hard forbear him
But I pray you sir Are you fast married
Be assured of this That the magnifico is much beloved And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the Duke's
He will divorce you Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The law with all his might to enforce it on Will give him cable
Let him do his spite
My services which I have done the signiory Shall out tongue his complaints
But look
What lights come yond
Those are the raised father and his friends
You were best go in
Is it they
By Janus I think no
The goodness of the night upon you friends
What is the news
The Duke does greet you general And he requires your haste post haste appearance Even on the instant
What is the matter think you
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another's heels And many of the consuls raised and met Are at the Duke's already
You have been hotly call'd for When being not at your lodging to be found The Senate hath sent about three quests To search you out
Tis well I am found by you
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you
Ancient what makes he here
I do not understand
He's married
To who
Marry to Come captain will you go
Have with you
Here comes another troop to seek for you
It is Brabantio General be advised He comes to bad intent
Holla
Stand there
Signior it is the Moor
You Roderigo
Come sir I am for you
O thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter
Damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her For I'll refer me to all things of sense If she in chains of magic were not bound Whether a maid so tender fair and happy So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd The wealthy curled darlings of our nation Would ever have to incur a general mock Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world a practicer Of arts inhibited and out of warrant  Lay hold upon him
If he do resist Subdue him at his peril
To prison till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answer
What if I do obey
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied Whose messengers are here about my side Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him
Tis true most worthy signior The Duke's in council and your noble self I am sure is sent for
How
The Duke in council
The Duke himself Or any of my brothers of the state Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own For if such actions may have passage free Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be
There is no composition in these news That gives them credit
Indeed they are disproportion'd My letters say a hundred and seven galleys
And mine a hundred and forty
And mine two hundred
What ho
What ho
What ho
A messenger from the galleys
Now what's the business
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo
How say you by this change
Nay in all confidence he's not for Rhodes
Here is more news
The Ottomites reverend and gracious Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes Have there injointed them with an after fleet
Ay so I thought
How many as you guess
Signior Montano Your trusty and most valiant servitor With his free duty recommends you thus And prays you to believe him
Tis certain then for Cyprus
Marcus Luccicos is not he in town
He's now in Florence
Write from us to him postposthaste dispatch
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor
Valiant Othello we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman
I did not see you welcome gentle signior We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight
So did I yours
Why what's the matter
My daughter
O my daughter
Dead
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter After your own sense
Humbly I thank your Grace
Here is the man this Moor whom now it seems Your special mandate for the state affairs Hath hither brought
We are very sorry for't
What in your own part can you say to this
Nothing but this is so
Most potent grave and reverend signiors My very noble and approved good masters That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter It is most true true I have married her The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent no more
Rude am I in my speech And little blest with the soft phrase of peace For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith Till now some nine moons wasted they have used Their dearest action in the tented field And little of this great world can I speak More than pertains to feats of broil and battle And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself
Yet by your gracious patience I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver Of my whole course of love what drugs what charms What conjuration and what mighty magic For such proceeding I am charged withal I won his daughter
A maiden never bold Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blush'd at herself and she in spite of nature Of years of country credit everything  To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on
It is judgement maim'd and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram conjured to this effect He wrought upon her
To vouch this is no proof Without more certain and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him
But Othello speak
Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maid's affections
Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth
Fetch Desdemona hither
Ancient conduct them you best know the place
And till she come as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I'll present How I did thrive in this fair lady's love And she in mine
Say it Othello
Her father loved me oft invited me Still question'd me the story of my life From year to year the battles sieges fortunes That I have pass'd
This to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline But still the house affairs would draw her thence Which ever as she could with haste dispatch She'ld come again and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse which I observing Took once a pliant hour and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively
I did consent And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffer'd
This only is the witchcraft I have used
Here comes the lady let her witness it
I think this tale would win my daughter too
My noble father I do perceive here a divided duty
To you I am bound for life and education My life and education both do learn me How to respect you you are the lord of duty I am hitherto your daughter
But here's my husband And so much duty as my mother show'd To you preferring you before her father So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord
God be with you
I have done
For your sake jewel I am glad at soul I have no other child For thy escape would teach me tyranny To hang clogs on them
I have done my lord
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which as a grise or step may help these lovers Into your favor
When remedies are past the griefs are ended By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes Patience her injury a mockery makes
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief He robs himself that spends a bootless grief
These sentences to sugar or to gall Being strong on both sides are equivocal
I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus
Othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you
You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition
The tyrant custom most grave senators Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice driven bed of down
I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites
Most humbly therefore bending to your state I crave fit disposition for my wife Due reference of place and exhibition With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding
Nor I
Nor I I would not there reside To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye
Most gracious Duke To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
What would you Desdemona
That I did love the Moor to live with him My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world
So that dear lords if I be left behind A moth of peace and he go to the war The rites for which I love him are bereft me And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence
Let me go with him
Let her have your voices
No when lightwing'd toys Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness My speculative and officed instruments That my disports corrupt and taint my business Let housewives make a skillet of my helm And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimation
Tonight my lord
This night
With all my heart
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again
Othello leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you With such things else of quality and respect As doth import you
Let it be so
Good night to everyone
And noble signior If virtue no delighted beauty lack Your son in law is far more fair than black
Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well
My life upon her faith
Iago
What say'st thou noble heart
What will I do thinkest thou
Why go to bed and sleep
I will incontinently drown myself
If thou dost I shall never love thee after
Why thou silly gentleman
It is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician
O villainous
I have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen I would change my humanity with a baboon
What should I do
I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it
Virtue
a fig
Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions
It cannot be
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will
Come be a man
Drown thyself
Drown cats and blind puppies
Put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard
It was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answer  able sequestration put but money in thy purse
These Moors are changeable in their wills fill thy purse with money
The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida
If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning
A pox of drowning thyself
It is clean out of the way
Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue
I have told thee often and I retell thee again and again I hate the Moor
My cause is hearted thine hath no less reason
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him
If thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport
There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered
Traverse go provide thy money
We will have more of this tomorrow
Adieu
Where shall we meet i' the morning
At my lodging
I'll be with thee betimes
Go to farewell
Do you hear Roderigo
What say you
No more of drowning do you hear
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit
I hate the Moor And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets He has done my office
I know not if't be true But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety
He holds me well The better shall my purpose work on him
Cassio's a proper man
Let me see now To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery How how
He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected framed to make women false
The Moor is of a free and open nature That thinks men honest that but seem to be so And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are
I have't
It is engender'd
Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light
What from the cape can you discern at sea
Nothing at all
It is a highwrought flood I cannot 'twixt the heaven and the main Descry a sail
What shall we hear of this
If that the Turkish fleet Be not enshelter'd and embay'd they are drown'd It is impossible to bear it out
News lads
Our wars are done
How
Is this true
I am glad on't 'tis a worthy governor
But this same Cassio though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe for they were parted With foul and violent tempest
Pray heavens he be For I have served him and the man commands Like a full soldier
Come let's do so For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance
Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor
O let the heavens Give him defense against the elements For I have lost him on a dangerous sea
Is he well shipp'd
His bark is stoutly timber'd and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance Therefore my hopes not surfeited to death Stand in bold cure
A sail a sail a sail
What noise
The town is empty on the brow o' the sea Stand ranks of people and they cry “A sail” My hopes do shape him for the governor
I pray you sir go forth And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived
I shall
But good lieutenant is your general wived
How now
who has put in
Tis one Iago ancient to the general
What is she
She that I spake of our great captain's captain Left in the conduct of the bold Iago Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A se'nnight's speed
Great Jove Othello guard And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath That he may bless this bay with his tall ship Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits And bring all Cyprus comfort
O behold The riches of the ship is come on shore
Ye men of Cyprus let her have your knees
Hail to thee lady
And the grace of heaven Before behind thee and on every hand Enwheel thee round
I thank you valiant Cassio
What tidings can you tell me of my lord
He is not yet arrived nor know I aught But that he's well and will be shortly here
O but I fear How lost you company
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship But hark
a sail
See for the news
Good ancient you are welcome
Welcome mistress
Sir would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me You'ld have enough
Alas she has no speech
In faith too much I find it still when I have list to sleep Marry before your ladyship I grant She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking
You have little cause to say so
O fie upon thee slanderer
You shall not write my praise
No let me not
What wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me
O gentle lady do not put me to't For I am nothing if not critical
Ay madam
I am not merry but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise
Come how wouldst thou praise me
I am about it but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze It plucks out brains and all
But my Muse labors And thus she is deliver'd
If she be fair and wise fairness and wit The one's for use the other useth it
Well praised
How if she be black and witty
If she be black and thereto have a wit She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit
Worse and worse
How if fair and foolish
She never yet was foolish that was fair For even her folly help'd her to an heir
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse
What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish
Thou praisest the worst best
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer
O most lame and impotent conclusion
Do not learn of him Emilia though he be thy husband
How say you Cassio
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor
He speaks home madam
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio
Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship
You say true 'tis so indeed
If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in
an excellent courtesy
tis so indeed
Yet again your fingers to your lips
Would they were clysterpipes for your sake
The Moor
I know his trumpet
Tis truly so
Let's meet him and receive him
Lo where he comes
O my fair warrior
My dear Othello
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me
O my soul's joy
If after every tempest come such calms May the winds blow till they have waken'd death
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas Olympus high and duck again as low As hell's from heaven
If it were now to die 'Twere now to be most happy for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate
The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow
Amen to that sweet powers
I cannot speak enough of this content It stops me here it is too much of joy And this and this the greatest discords be They kiss
O you are well tuned now
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music As honest as I am
Come let us to the castle
News friends our wars are done the Turks are drown'd
Honey you shall be well desired in Cyprus I have found great love amongst them
O my sweet I prattle out of fashion and I dote In mine own comforts
Come Desdemona Once more well met at Cyprus
Do thou meet me presently at the harbor
Come hither
If thou be'st valiant as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them list me
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard
First I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him
With him
Why 'tis not possible
Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies
And will she love him still for prating
Let not thy discreet heart think it
Her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil
When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor is defec  tive in
Now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does
A knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better com  passing of his salt and most hidden loose affection
I cannot believe that in her she's full of most blest condition
Blest fig'send
The wine she drinks is made of grapes
If she had been blest she would never have loved the Moor
Blest pudding
Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand
Didst not mark that
Yes that I did but that was but courtesy
Lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together
Villainous thoughts Roderigo
When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion
Pish
But sir be you ruled by me
I have brought you from Venice
Cassio knows you not
I'll not be far from you
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favorably minister
Provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qual  ification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio
So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed with  out the which there were no expectation of our prosperity
I warrant thee
Meet me by and by at the citadel
I must fetch his necessaries ashore
Farewell
Adieu
It is Othello's pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial
So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed
All offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven
Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello
Iago hath direction what to do But notwithstanding with my personal eye Will I look to't
Iago is most honest
Michael good night
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you
Come my dear love The purchase made the fruits are to ensue That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you
Good night
Welcome Iago we must to the watch
Not this hour lieutenant 'tis not yet ten o' the clock
Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame
He hath not yet made wan  ton the night with her and she is sport for Jove
She's a most exquisite lady
And I'll warrant her full of game
Indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature
What an eye she has
Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation
An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
And when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
She is indeed perfection
Well happiness to their sheets
Come lieutenant I have a stoup of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello
I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment
O they are our friends
But one cup I'll drink for you
I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here
I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more
What man
Where are they
Here at the door I pray you call them in
I'll do't but it dislikes me
If I can fasten but one cup upon him With that which he hath drunk tonight already He'll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog
Now 'mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle
Some wine ho
And let me the canakin clink clink [Sings
Fore God an excellent song
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking
Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your Almain he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled
To the health of our general
King Stephen was a worthy peer His breeches cost him but a crown He held them sixpence all too dear With that he call'd the tailor lown
Will you hear't again
It's true good lieutenant
For mine own part no offense to the general nor any man of quality I hope to be saved
And so do I too lieutenant
Let's have no more of this let's to our affairs
God forgive us our sins
Gentlemen let's look to our business
I am not drunk now I can stand well enough and I speak well enough
Excellent well
And do but see his vice 'Tis to his virtue a just equinox The one as long as the other
Tis pity of him
I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island
But is he often thus
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep He'll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle
It were well The general were put in mind of it
How now Roderigo
I pray you after the lieutenant go
What noise
You rogue
You rascal
What's the matter lieutenant
A knave teach me my duty
But I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle
Beat me
Nay good lieutenant I pray you sir hold your hand
Let me go sir or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard
Come come you're drunk
Drunk
What is the matter here
Zounds I bleed still I am hurt to the death
Hold for your lives
Hold ho Lieutenant sir Montano gentlemen  Have you forgot all place of sense and duty
Hold
Why how now ho
from whence ariseth this
Are we turn'd Turks and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites
What is the matter masters
Honest Iago that look'st dead with grieving Speak who began this
How comes it Michael you are thus forgot
I pray you pardon me I cannot speak
Worthy Montano you were wont be civil The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure
What's the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a nightbrawler
Give me answer to it
Nor know I aught By me that's said or done amiss this night Unless self charity be sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us
Now by heaven My blood begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgement collied Assays to lead the way
If I once stir Or do but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke
Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approved in this offense Though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth Shall lose me
What
in a town of war Yet wild the people's hearts brimful of fear To manage private and domestic quarrel In night and on the court and guard of safety
Tis monstrous
Iago who began't
If partially affined or leagued in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier
Touch me not so near I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him
Thus it is general
Montano and myself being in speech There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determined sword To execute upon him
He swift of foot Outran my purpose and I return'd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I ne'er might say before
When I came back  For this was brief  I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them
More of this matter cannot I report
But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass
I know Iago Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter Making it light to Cassio
Cassio I love thee But never more be officer of mine
Look if my gentle love be not raised up
I'll make thee an example
What's the matter
All's well now sweeting come away to bed
Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
Lead him off
Iago look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
What are you hurt lieutenant
Ay past all surgery
Marry heaven forbid
Reputation reputation reputation
O I have lost my reputation
I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial
My reputation Iago my reputation
As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputa  tion
Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving
You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser
What man
there are ways to recover the general again
You are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion
Sue to him again and he's yours
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer
Drunk
and speak parrot
and squabble
swagger
swear
and discourse fustian with one's own shadow
O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil
What was he that you followed with your sword
What had he done to you
I know not
Is't possible
I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore
O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains
that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts
Why but you are now well enough
How came you thus recovered
Come you are too severe a moraler
As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good
I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard
Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all
To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast
O strange
Every inordinate cup is unblest and the ingredient is a devil
Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used
Exclaim no more against it
And good lieutenant I think you think I love you
I have well approved it sir
I drunk
You or any man living may be drunk at some time man
I'll tell you what you shall do
Confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again
She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested
This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before
You advise me well
I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
You are in the right
Good night lieutenant I must to the watch
Good night honest Iago
And what's he then that says I play the villain
When this advice is free I give and honest Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again
For 'tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit
She's framed as fruitful As the free elements
And then for her To win the Moor were't to renounce his baptism All seals and symbols of redeemed sin His soul is so enfetter'd to her love That she may make unmake do what she list Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good
Divinity of hell
So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all
How now Roderigo
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry
How poor are they that have not patience
What wound did ever heal but by degrees
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on dilatory time
Does't not go well
By the mass 'tis morning Pleasure and action make the hours seem short
Retire thee go where thou art billeted Away I say
Thou shalt know more hereafter Nay get thee gone
Masters play here I will content your pains Something that's brief and bid “Good morrow general” Why masters have your instruments been in Naples that they speak i' the nose thus
How sir how
Are these I pray you wind instruments
Ay marry are they sir
Whereby hangs a tale sir
Marry sir
Well sir we will not
We have none such sir
Then put up your pipes in your bag for I'll away
Dost thou hear my honest friend
No I hear not your honest friend I hear you
Prithee keep up thy quillets
There's a poor piece of gold for thee
If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favor of speech
Wilt thou do this
Do good my friend
In happy time Iago
You have not been abed then
Why no the day had broke Before we parted
I have made bold Iago To send in to your wife
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access
I'll send her to you presently And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way that your converse and business May be more free
I humbly thank you for't
I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest
The general and his wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly
The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again
Yet I beseech you If you think fit or that it may be done Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone
Pray you come in
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely
I am much bound to you
Well my good lord I'll do't
This fortification gentlemen shall we see't
We'll wait upon your lordship
Be thou assured good Cassio I will do All my abilities in thy behalf
O that's an honest fellow
Do not doubt Cassio But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were
Bounteous madam Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio He's never anything but your true servant
Ay but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet Or breed itself so out of circumstances That I being absent and my place supplied My general will forget my love and service
My lord shall never rest I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift I'll intermingle everything he does With Cassio's suit
Therefore be merry Cassio For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away
Madam here comes my lord
Madam I'll take my leave
Nay stay and hear me speak
Madam not now
I am very ill at ease Unfit for mine own purposes
Well do your discretion
Ha
I like not that
What dost thou say
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife
Cassio my lord
No sure I cannot think it That he would steal away so guiltylike Seeing you coming
I do believe 'twas he
How now my lord
I have been talking with a suitor here A man that languishes in your displeasure
Who is't you mean
Why your lieutenant Cassio
Went he hence now
Ay sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him
Good love call him back
Not now sweet Desdemona some other time
But shall't be shortly
The sooner sweet for you
Shall't be tonight at supper
No not tonight
Tomorrow dinner then
I shall not dine at home I meet the captains at the citadel
In faith he's penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason  Save that they say the wars must make examples Out of their best is not almost a fault To incur a private check
When shall he come
Tell me Othello
I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mammering on
What
Nay when I have a suit  Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted
Shall I deny you
No
Farewell my lord
Emilia come
Be as your fancies teach you Whate'er you be I am obedient
Excellent wretch
Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee
and when I love thee not Chaos is come again
Did Michael Cassio when you woo'd my lady Know of your love
He did from first to last
Why dost thou ask
But for a satisfaction of my thought No further harm
Why of thy thought Iago
I did not think he had been acquainted with her
O yes and went between us very oft
Indeed
Indeed
ay indeed
Discern'st thou aught in that
Is he not honest
Honest my lord
Honest
Ay honest
My lord for aught I know
What dost thou think
Think my lord
Think my lord
By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown
What didst not like
If thou dost love me Show me thy thought
My lord you know I love you
I think thou dost And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man that's just They're close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot rule
For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest
I think so too
Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none
Certain men should be what they seem
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man
Utter my thoughts
Why say they are vile and false As where's that palace where in to foul things Sometimes intrude not
Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and lawdays and in session sit With meditations lawful
Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear A stranger to thy thoughts
I do beseech you  Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my nature's plague To spy into abuses and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not that your wisdom yet From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance
It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts
What dost thou mean
By heaven I'll know thy thoughts
You cannot if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst 'tis in my custody
Ha
That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he o'er Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
O misery
Why why is this
Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions
Exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference
Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me
No Iago I'll see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this Away at once with love or jealousy
I am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit
Therefore as I am bound Receive it from me
I speak not yet of proof
Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands their best conscience Is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown
Dost thou say so
She did deceive her father marrying you And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks She loved them most
And so she did
I am bound to thee forever
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits
Not a jot not a jot
I' faith I fear it has
I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love
But I do see you're moved I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion
I will not
Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aim not at
No not much moved
I do not think but Desdemona's honest
Long live she so
and long live you to think so
But pardon me
I do not in position Distinctly speak of her though I may fear Her will recoiling to her better judgement May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent
Leave me Iago
My lord I take my leave
Why did I marry
This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds
In the meantime Let me be thought too busy in my fears  As worthy cause I have to fear I am  And hold her free I do beseech your honor
Fear not my government
I once more take my leave
This fellow's of exceeding honesty And knows all qualities with a learned spirit Of human dealings
If I do prove her haggard Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune
O curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites
I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses
Yet 'tis the plague of great ones Prerogatived are they less than the base 'Tis destiny unshunnable like death Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken
I'll not believe't
How now my dear Othello
Your dinner and the generous islanders By you invited do attend your presence
I am to blame
Why do you speak so faintly
Are you not well
I have a pain upon my forehead here
Come I'll go in with you
I am very sorry that you are not well
I'll have the work ta'en out And give't Iago
What he will do with it Heaven knows not I I nothing but to please his fantasy
Do not you chide I have a thing for you
A thing for me
It is a common thing  Ha
To have a foolish wife
O is that all
What will you give me now For that same handkerchief
What handkerchief
What handkerchief
Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona That which so often you did bid me steal
Hast stol'n it from her
Look here it is
A good wench give it me
What will you do with't that you have been so earnest To have me filch it
Why what is that to you
If't be not for some purpose of import Give't me again
Poor lady she'll run mad When she shall lack it
Be not acknown on't I have use for it
Go leave me
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin And let him find it
Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday
Why how now general
No more of that
Avaunt
be gone
How now my lord
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust
I am sorry to hear this
I had been happy if the general camp Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body So I had nothing known
O now forever Farewell the tranquil mind
Farewell content
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars That make ambition virtue
O farewell Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump The spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife The royal banner and all quality Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
And O you mortal engines whose rude throats The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit Farewell
Othello's occupation's gone
Is't possible my lord
Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore Be sure of it
Give me the ocular proof Or by the worth of man's eternal soul Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my waked wrath
Is't come to this
Make me to see't or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
O grace
O heaven defend me
Are you a man
have you a soul or sense
God be wi' you take mine office
O wretched fool That livest to make thine honesty a vice
O monstrous world
Take note take note O world To be direct and honest is not safe
I thank you for this profit and from hence I'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense
I should be wise for honesty's a fool And loses that it works for
By the world I think my wife be honest and think she is not I think that thou art just and think thou art not
I'll have some proof
Her name that was as fresh As Dian's visage is now begrimed and black As mine own face
If there be cords or knives Poison or fire or suffocating streams I'll not endure it
Would I were satisfied
You would be satisfied
Would
Nay I will
And may
But how
how satisfied my lord
Death and damnation
O
It were a tedious difficulty I think To bring them to that prospect
Damn them then If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own
What then
how then
What shall I say
Where's satisfaction
It is impossible you should see this Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk
But yet I say If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction you may have't
Give me a living reason she's disloyal
I do not like the office But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love I will go on
I lay with Cassio lately And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep
Nay this was but his dream
And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly
I'll tear her all to pieces
Tell me but this Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand
I gave her such a one 'twas my first gift
Now do I see 'tis true
Arise black vengeance from thy hollow cell
Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate
Swell bosom with thy fraught For 'tis of aspics' tongues
Yet be content
O blood blood blood
Patience I say your mind perhaps may change
Let him command And to obey shall be in me remorse What bloody business ever
Damn her lewd minx
O damn her
Come go with me apart I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil
Now art thou my lieutenant
I am your own forever
Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies
I dare not say he lies anywhere
Why man
He's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stab  bing
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie
Can anything be made of this
I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report
I will catechize the world for him that is make ques  tions and by them answer
Seek him bid him come hither
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
To do this is within the compass of man's wit and therefore I will attempt the doing it
Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia
I know not madam
Believe me I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes and but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are it were enough To put him to ill thinking
Is he not jealous
Who he
I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him
Look where he comes
I will not leave him now till Cassio Be call'd to him
How is't with you my lord
Well my good lady
O hardness to dissemble
How do you Desdemona
Well my good lord
Give me your hand
This hand is moist my lady
This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer Much castigation exercise devout For here's a young and sweating devil here That commonly rebels
Tis a good hand A frank one
You may indeed say so For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart
A liberal hand
The hearts of old gave hands But our new heraldry is hands not hearts
I cannot speak of this
Come now your promise
What promise chuck
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me Lend me thy handkerchief
Here my lord
That which I gave you
I have it not about me
Not
No faith my lord
That's a fault
That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give She was a charmer and could almost read The thoughts of people
She told her while she kept it 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love but if she lost it Or made a gift of it my father's eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies
She dying gave it me And bid me when my fate would have me wive To give it her
Is't possible
Indeed
is't true
Most veritable therefore look to't well
Then would to God that I had never seen't
Ha
wherefore
Why do you speak so startingly and rash
Is't lost
is't gone
speak is it out o' the way
Heaven bless us
Say you
It is not lost but what an if it were
How
I say it is not lost
Fetch't let me see it
Why so I can sir but I will not now
This is a trick to put me from my suit
Pray you let Cassio be received again
Come come You'll never meet a more sufficient man
The handkerchief
A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love Shared dangers with you  The handkerchief
In sooth you are to blame
Away
Is not this man jealous
I ne'er saw this before
Sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief I am most unhappy in the loss of it
Go and importune her
How now good Cassio
What's the news with you
I would not be delay'd
Alas thrice gentle Cassio
My advocation is not now in tune My lord is not my lord nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor alter'd
So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech
You must awhile be patient
What I can do I will and more I will Than for myself I dare
Let that suffice you
Is my lord angry
He went hence but now And certainly in strange unquietness
Can he be angry
Something of moment then
I prithee do so
Something sure of state Either from Venice or some unhatch'd practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things Though great ones are their object
Tis even so For let our finger ache and it indues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain
Nay we must think men are not gods I was unhandsome warrior as I am Arraigning his unkindness with my soul But now I find I had suborn'd the witness And he's indicted falsely
Pray heaven it be state matters as you think And no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning you
Alas the day I never gave him cause
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so They are not ever jealous for the cause But jealous for they are jealous
Tis a monster Begot upon itself born on itself
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind
Lady amen
I will go seek him
Cassio walk hereabout
If I do find him fit I'll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost
I humbly thank your ladyship
Save you friend Cassio
What make you from home
How is it with you my most fair Bianca
I'faith sweet love I was coming to your house
seven days and nights
Eight score eight hours
and lovers' absent hours More tedious than the dial eight score times
O weary reckoning
O Cassio whence came this
This is some token from a newer friend
Well well
Go to woman
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth From whence you have them
You are jealous now That this is from some mistress some remembrance No by my faith Bianca
Why whose is it
I know not sweet
I found it in my chamber
I like the work well
Leave you
wherefore
I do attend here on the general And think it no addition nor my wish To have him see me woman'd
Why I pray you
Not that I love you not
But that you do not love me
I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night
Tis very good I must be circumstanced
Will you think so
Think so Iago
What To kiss in private
An unauthorized kiss
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more not meaning any harm
Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm
Why then 'tis hers my lord and being hers She may I think bestow't on any man
Ay what of that
That's not so good now
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong
He hath my lord but be you well assured No more than he'll unswear
What hath he said
Faith that he did I know not what he did
What
what
With her on her what you will
Zounds that's fulsome
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction
It is not words that shakes me thus
Pish
Noses ears and lips
Is't possible
Confess Handkerchief O devil
Work on My medicine work
Thus credulous fools are caught And many worthy and chaste dames even thus All guiltless meet reproach
What ho
My lord
My lord I say
Othello
How now Cassio
What's the matter
Rub him about the temples
Look he stirs Do you withdraw yourself a little while He will recover straight
When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you
How is it general
Have you not hurt your head
Dost thou mock me
I mock you
No by heaven
Would you would bear your fortune like a man
A horned man's a monster and a beast
There's many a beast then in a populous city And many a civil monster
Did he confess it
Good sir be a man Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked May draw with you
There's millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar
Your case is better
O 'tis the spite of hell the fiend's archmock To lip a wanton in a secure couch And to suppose her chaste
No let me know And knowing what I am I know what she shall be
O thou art wise 'tis certain
Stand you awhile apart Confine yourself but in a patient list
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief  A passion most unsuiting such a man  Cassio came hither
I shifted him away And laid good ‘scuse upon your ecstasy Bade him anon return and here speak with me The which he promised
Do but encave yourself And mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns That dwell in every region of his face For I will make him tell the tale anew Where how how oft how long ago and when He hath and is again to cope your wife I say but mark his gesture
Marry patience Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen And nothing of a man
Dost thou hear Iago
That's not amiss But yet keep time in all
Will you withdraw
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca A housewife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio as 'tis the strumpet's plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one
He when he hears of her cannot refrain From the excess of laughter
Here he comes
As he shall smile Othello shall go mad And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio's smiles gestures and light behavior Quite in the wrong
How do you now lieutenant
The worser that you give me the addition Whose want even kills me
Ply Desdemona well and you are sure on't
Now if this suit lay in Bianca's power How quickly should you speed
Alas poor caitiff
Look how he laughs already
I never knew a woman love man so
Alas poor rogue
I think i'faith she loves me
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
Do you hear Cassio
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er
Go to well said well said
Ha ha ha
Do you triumph Roman
Do you triumph
I marry her
What
A customer
I prithee bear some charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome
Ha ha ha
So so so so
They laugh that win
Faith the cry goes that you shall marry her
Prithee say true
I am a very villain else
Have you scored me
Well
This is the monkey's own giving out
She is persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise
Iago beckons me now he begins the story
She was here even now she haunts me in every place
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales and pulls me
Ha ha ha
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber
O I see that nose of yours but not that dog I shall throw it to
Well I must leave her company
Before me
look where she comes
Tis such another fitchew
marry a perfumed one
What do you mean by this haunting of me
Let the devil and his dam haunt you
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now
I was a fine fool to take it
I must take out the work
A likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there
This is some minx's token and I must take out the work
There give it your hobby horse
Wheresoever you had it I'll take out no work on't
How now my sweet Bianca
how now
how now
By heaven that should be my handkerchief
An you'll come to supper tonight you may an you will not come when you are next prepared for
After her after her
Faith I must she'll rail i' the street else
Will you sup there
Faith I intend so
Well I may chance to see you for I would very fain speak with you
Prithee come will you
Go to say no more
How shall I murder him Iago
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice
O Iago
And did you see the handkerchief
Was that mine
Yours by this hand
And to see how he prizes the fool  ish woman your wife
She gave it him and he hath given it his whore
I would have him nine years akilling
A fine woman
a fair woman
a sweet woman
Nay you must forget that
Ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight for she shall not live
No my heart is turned to stone I strike it and it hurts my hand
O the world hath not a sweeter creature
She might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks
Nay that's not your way
Hang her
I do but say what she is
O she will sing the savageness out of a bear
Of so high and plenteous wit and invention
She's the worse for all this
O a thousand a thousand times
And then of so gentle a condition
Ay too gentle
Nay that's certain
But yet the pity of it Iago
O Iago the pity of it Iago
If you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody
I will chop her into messes
Cuckold me
O 'tis foul in her
With mine officer
That's fouler
Get me some poison Iago this night
I'll not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again
And for Cassio let me be his undertaker
You shall hear more by midnight
Excellent good
A trumpet without
What trumpet is that same
Something from Venice sure
Tis Lodovico Come from the Duke
And see your wife is with him
God save the worthy general
With all my heart sir
The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures
And what's the news good cousin Lodovico
I am very glad to see you signior Welcome to Cyprus
I thank you
How does Lieutenant Cassio
Lives sir
Cousin there's fall'n between him and my lord An unkind breech but you shall make all well
Are you sure of that
My lord
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio
A most unhappy one
I would do much To atone them for the love I bear to Cassio
Fire and brimstone
My lord
Are you wise
What is he angry
May be the letter moved him For as I think they do command him home Deputing Cassio in his government
By my troth I am glad on't
Indeed
My lord
I am glad to see you mad
I have not deserved this
My lord this would not be believed in Venice Though I should swear I saw't
O devil devil
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile
Out of my sight
I will not stay to offend you
Mistress
My lord
What would you with her sir
Who I my lord
Proceed you in your tears
Concerning this sir O well painted passion  I am commanded home
Get you away I'll send for you anon
Sir I obey the mandate And will return to Venice
Hence avaunt
Cassio shall have my place
And sir tonight I do entreat that we may sup together
You are welcome sir to Cyprus
Goats and monkeys
Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate Call all in all sufficient
This the nature Whom passion could not shake
whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce
He is much changed
Are his wits safe
Is he not light of brain
He's that he is
What strike his wife
Faith that was not so well yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst
Is it his use
Or did the letters work upon his blood And new create this fault
Alas alas
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known
I am sorry that I am deceived in him
You have seen nothing then
Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
Yes you have seen Cassio and she together
But then I saw no harm and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them
What did they never whisper
Never my lord
Nor send you out o' the way
Never
To fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
Never my lord
That's strange
I durst my lord to wager she is honest Lay down my soul at stake
If any wretch have put this in your head Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse
For if she be not honest chaste and true There's no man happy the purest of their wives Is foul as slander
She says enough yet she's a simple bawd That cannot say as much
My lord what is your will
Pray chuck come hither
What is your pleasure
Let me see your eyes Look in my face
What horrible fancy's this
Upon my knees what doth your speech import
I understand a fury in your words But not the words
Why what art thou
Your wife my lord your true and loyal wife
Come swear it damn thyself Lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves Should fear to seize thee
Therefore be doubledamn'd Swear thou art honest
Heaven doth truly know it
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
To whom my lord
with whom
how am I false
O Desdemona
Away
away
away
Alas the heavy day
Why do you weep
Am I the motive of these tears my lord
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back Lay not your blame on me
If you have lost him Why I have lost him too
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in
Turn thy complexion there Patience thou young and roselipp'd cherubin Ay there look grim as hell
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest
O ay as summer flies are in the shambles That quicken even with blowing
O thou weed Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee would thou hadst ne'er been born
Alas what ignorant sin have I committed
Was this fair paper this most goodly book Made to write “whore” upon
What committed
Committed
O thou public commoner
I should make very forges of my cheeks That would to cinders burn up modesty Did I but speak thy deeds
What committed
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth And will not hear it
What committed
Impudent strumpet
By heaven you do me wrong
Are not you a strumpet
No as I am a Christian
If to preserve this vessel for my lord From any other foul unlawful touch Be not to be a strumpet I am none
What not a whore
No as I shall be saved
Is't possible
O heaven forgive us
You mistress That have the office opposite to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hell
You you ay you
Alas what does this gentleman conceive
How do you madam
How do you my good lady
Faith half asleep
Good madam what's the matter with my lord
With who
Why with my lord madam
Who is thy lord
He that is yours sweet lady
I have none
Do not talk to me Emilia I cannot weep nor answer have I none But what should go by water
Prithee tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets
Remember And call thy husband hither
Here's a change indeed
Tis meet I should be used so very meet
How have I been behaved that he might stick The small'st opinion on my least misuse
What is your pleasure madam
How is't with you
I cannot tell
What's the matter lady
Alas Iago my lord hath so bewhored her Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her As true hearts cannot bear
Am I that name Iago
What name fair lady
Such as she says my lord did say I was
Why did he so
I do not know I am sure I am none such
Do not weep do not weep
Alas the day
Hath she forsook so many noble matches Her father and her country and her friends To be call'd whore
Would it not make one weep
It is my wretched fortune
How comes this trick upon him
Nay heaven doth know
I will be hang'd if some eternal villain Some busy and insinuating rogue Some cogging cozening slave to get some office Have not devised this slander I'll be hang'd else
Fie there is no such man it is impossible
If any such there be heaven pardon him
A halter pardon him
And hell gnaw his bones
Why should he call her whore
Who keeps her company
What place
What time
What form
What likelihood
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave Some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
O heaven that such companions thou'ldst unfold And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to the west
Speak within door
O fie upon them
Some such squire he was That turn'd your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor
You are a fool go to
O good Iago What shall I do to win my lord again
Good friend go to him for by this light of heaven I know not how I lost him
Unkindness may do much And his unkindness may defeat my life But never taint my love
If 'twere no other  'Tis but so I warrant
Hark how these instruments summon to supper
How now Roderigo
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me
What in the contrary
Every day thou daffest me with some device Iago and rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conve  niency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope
Will you hear me Roderigo
Faith I have heard too much for your words and per  formances are no kin together
You charge me most unjustly
With nought but truth
I have wasted myself out of my means
The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist
Well go to very well
Very well
go to
I cannot go to man nor 'tis not very well
By this hand I say 'tis very scurvy and begin to find myself fopped in it
Very well
I tell you 'tis not very well
You have said now
Ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing
Why now I see there's mettle in thee and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before
Give me thy hand Roderigo
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet I protest have dealt most directly in thy affair
It hath not appeared
I grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without wit and judgement
Well what is it
Is it within reason and compass
Sir there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place
Is that true
Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice
O no he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio
How do you mean removing of him
Why by making him uncapable of Othello's place knocking out his brains
And that you would have me to do
Ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right
He sups tonight with a harlotry and thither will I go to him
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune
Come stand not amazed at it but go along with me I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him
It is now high sup  pertime and the night grows to waste
About it
I will hear further reason for this
And you shall be satisfied
I do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further
O pardon me ‘twill do me good to walk
Madam good night I humbly thank your ladyship
Your honor is most welcome
Will you walk sir
O Desdemona  My lord
I will my lord
How goes it now
He looks gentler than he did
Dismiss me
It was his bidding therefore good Emilia Give me my nightly wearing and adieu
We must not now displease him
I would you had never seen him
So would not I
My love doth so approve him That even his stubbornness his checks his frowns  Prithee unpin me have grace and favor in them
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
All's one
Good faith how foolish are our minds
If I do die before thee prithee shroud me In one of those same sheets
Come come you talk
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara She was in love and he she loved proved mad And did forsake her
She had a song of “willow” An old thing 'twas but it express'd her fortune And she died singing it
Prithee dispatch
Shall I go fetch your nightgown
No unpin me here
This Lodovico is a proper man
A very handsome man
He speaks well
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip
The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree Sing all a green willow Her hand on her bosom her head on her knee Sing willow willow willow
It's the wind
I call'd my love false love but what said he then
Mine eyes do itch Doth that bode weeping
Tis neither here nor there
I have heard it said so
O these men these men
Dost thou in conscience think tell me Emilia  That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind
There be some such no question
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
Why would not you
No by this heavenly light
Nor I neither by this heavenly light I might do't as well i' the dark
Wouldst thou do such a thing for all the world
The world's a huge thing it is a great price For a final vice
In troth I think thou wouldst not
In troth I think I should and undo't when I had done
Marry I would not do such a thing for a jointring nor for measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition but for the whole world why who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch
I should venture purgatory for't
Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong For the whole world
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world and hav  ing the world for your labor 'tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right
I do not think there is any such woman
Yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for
What is it that they do When they change us for others
Is it sport
I think it doth
Is't frailty that thus errs
It is so too
And have not we affections Desires for sport and frailty as men have
Good night good night
Heaven me such uses send Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend
Quick quick fear nothing I'll be at thy elbow
It makes us or it mars us think on that And fix most firm thy resolution
Be near at hand I may miscarry in't
Forth my sword he dies
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense And he grows angry
Now whether he kill Cassio Or Cassio him or each do kill the other Every way makes my gain
Live Roderigo He calls me to a restitution large Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him As gifts to Desdemona It must not be
If Cassio do remain He hath a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly and besides the Moor May unfold me to him there stand I in much peril No he must die
I know his gait 'tis he
Villain thou diest
O I am slain
I am maim'd forever
Help ho
Murder
Murder
O villain that I am
It is even so
O help ho
Light
A surgeon
Tis he
O brave Iago honest and just That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong
Strumpet I come
Forth of my heart those charms thine eyes are blotted Thy bed lust stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted
What ho
No watch
No passage
Murder
Murder
Tis some mischance the cry is very direful
O help
Hark
O wretched villain
Nobody come
Then shall I bleed to death
Hark
Here's one comes in his shirt with light and weapons
Who's there
Did not you hear a cry
Here here
for heaven's sake help me
What's the matter
This is Othello's ancient as I take it
The same indeed a very valiant fellow
What are you here that cry so grievously
Iago
O I am spoil'd undone by villains
Give me some help
O me lieutenant
What villains have done this
I think that one of them is hereabout And cannot make away
O treacherous villains
What are you there
Come in and give some help
O help me here
That's one of them
O murderous slave
O villain
O damn'd Iago
O inhuman dog
Kill men i' the dark
Where be these bloody thieves
How silent is this town
Ho
Murder
Murder
What may you be
Are you of good or evil
As you shall prove us praise us
Signior Lodovico
He sir
I cry you mercy
Here's Cassio hurt by villains
Cassio
How is't brother
My leg is cut in two
Marry heaven forbid
What is the matter ho
Who is't that cried
Who is't that cried
O my dear Cassio my sweet Cassio
O Cassio Cassio Cassio
O notable strumpet
Cassio may you suspect Who they should be that have thus mangled you
No
Lend me a garter
So
O for a chair To bear him easily hence
Alas he faints
O Cassio Cassio Cassio
Gentlemen all I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury
Patience awhile good Cassio
Come come Lend me a light
Know we this face or no
Alas my friend and my dear countryman Roderigo
No yes sure
O heaven
Roderigo
What of Venice
Even he sir
Did you know him
Know him
ay
Signior Gratiano
I cry you gentle pardon These bloody accidents must excuse my manners That so neglected you
O a chair a chair
Roderigo
He he ’tis he
Some good man bear him carefully from hence I'll fetch the general's surgeon
For you mistress Save you your labor
None in the world nor do I know the man
What look you pale
O bear him out o' the air
Stay you good gentlemen
Look you pale mistress
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye
Nay if you stare we shall hear more anon
Behold her well I pray you look upon her
Do you see gentlemen
Nay guiltiness will speak Though tongues were out of use
Las what's the matter
What's the matter husband
Alas good gentleman
alas good Cassio
This is the fruit of whoring
Prithee Emilia Go know of Cassio where he supp'd tonight
What do you shake at that
He supp'd at my house but I therefore shake not
O did he so
I charge you go with me
Fie fie upon thee strumpet
I am no strumpet but of life as honest As you that thus abuse me
As I
foh
fie upon thee
Kind gentlemen let's go see poor Cassio dress'd
Come mistress you must tell's another tale
Emilia run you to the citadel And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd
Will you go on
Aside
This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite
It is the cause
Yet I'll not shed her blood Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster
Yet she must die else she'll betray more men
Put out the light and then put out the light
O balmy breath that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword
One more one more Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee And love thee after
One more and this the last So sweet was ne'er so fatal
She wakes
Who's there
Othello
Ay Desdemona
Will you come to bed my lord
Have you pray'd tonight Desdemona
Ay my lord
If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace Solicit for it straight
Alas my lord what may you mean by that
I would not kill thy soul
Talk you of killing
Ay I do
Then heaven have mercy on me
Amen with all my heart
If you say so I hope you will not kill me
Hum
And yet I fear you for you are fatal then When your eyes roll so
Why I should fear I know not Since guiltiness I know not but yet I feel I fear
Think on thy sins
They are loves I bear to you
Ay and for that thou diest
That death's unnatural that kills for loving
Alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
Peace and be still
I will so
What's the matter
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee Thou gavest to Cassio
No by my life and soul
Send for the man and ask him
Sweet soul take heed Take heed of perjury thou are on thy deathbed
Ay but not yet to die
Thou art to die
Then Lord have mercy on me
I say amen
And have you mercy too
I never did Offend you in my life never loved Cassio But with such general warranty of heaven As I might love
I never gave him token
By heaven I saw my handkerchief in ‘s hand
O perjured woman
He found it then I never gave it him
He hath confess'd
What my lord
That he hath used thee
How
unlawfully
Ay
He will not say so
No his mouth is stopp'd Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't
O my fear interprets
What is he dead
Had all his hairs been lives my great revenge Had stomach for them all
Alas he is betray'd and I undone
Out strumpet
Weep'st thou for him to my face
O banish me my lord but kill me not
Down strumpet
Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
Nay if you strive  But half an hour
Being done there is no pause
But while I say one prayer
It is too late
My lord my lord
What ho
my lord my lord
What noise is this
Not dead
not yet quite dead
I that am cruel am yet merciful I would not have thee linger in thy pain
So so
What ho
my lord my lord
Who's there
O good my lord I would speak a word with you
By and by
She's dead
Ha
no more moving
Still as the grave
Shall she come in
were't good
I think she stirs again
No
What's best to do
If she come in she'll sure speak to my wife
My wife
My wife
What wife
I have no wife
O insupportable
O heavy hour
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse Of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe Should yawn at alteration
I do beseech you That I may speak with you O good my lord
I had forgot thee
O come in Emilia
Soft by and by
Let me the curtains draw
Where art thou
What's the matter with thee now
O my good lord yonder's foul murders done
What now
But now my lord
It is the very error of the moon She comes more nearer earth than she was wont And makes men mad
Cassio my lord hath kill'd a young Venetian Call'd Roderigo
Roderigo kill'd
And Cassio kill'd
No Cassio is not kill'd
Not Cassio kill'd
Then murder 's out of tune And sweet revenge grows harsh
O falsely falsely murdered
Alas what cry is that
That
what
Out and alas
That was my lady's voice
Help
help ho
help
O lady speak again
Sweet Desdemona
O sweet mistress speak
A guiltless death I die
O who hath done this deed
Nobody I myself
O farewell
Why how should she be murdered
Alas who knows
You heard her say herself it was not I
O the more angel she And you the blacker devil
She turn'd to folly and she was a whore
Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
She was false as water
Thou art rash as fire to say That she was false
O she was heavenly true
Cassio did top her ask thy husband else
O I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity
Thy husband knew it all
My husband
Thy husband
That she was false to wedlock
Ay with Cassio
Nay had she been true If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite I'ld not have sold her for it
My husband
My husband
What needs this iteration woman
I say thy husband
O mistress villainy hath made mocks with love
My husband say that she was false
He woman I say thy husband
Dost understand the word
My friend thy husband honest honest Iago
If he say so may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day
He lies to the heart
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain
Ha
Peace you were best
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt
O gull
O dolt
As ignorant as dirt
Thou hast done a deed  I care not for thy sword I'll make thee known Though I lost twenty lives
Help
help ho
help
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress
Murder murder
What is the matter
How now general
O are you come Iago
You have done well That men must lay their murders on your neck
What is the matter
Speak for my heart is full
I told him what I thought and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true
But did you ever tell him she was false
I did
You told a lie an odious damned lie Upon my soul a lie a wicked lie
She false with Cassio
Did you say with Cassio
With Cassio mistress
Go to charm your tongue
I will not charm my tongue I am bound to speak
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed
O heavens forfend
And your reports have set the murder on
Tis a strange truth
O monstrous act
Villainy villainy villainy
I think upon't I think I smell't O villainy
What are you mad
I charge you get you home
Perchance Iago I will ne'er go home
O
O
O
Nay lay thee down and roar For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye
O she was foul
I scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd
I know this act shows horrible and grim
Poor Desdemon
I saw it in his hand It was a handkerchief an antique token My father gave my mother
O heaven
O heavenly powers
Hold your peace
Twill out 'twill
I peace
Be wise and get you home
I will not
Fie
Your sword upon a woman
O thou dull Moor
That handkerchief thou speak'st of I found by fortune and did give my husband For often with a solemn earnestness More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle He begg'd of me to steal it
Villainous whore
She give it Cassio
No alas I found it And I did give't my husband
Filth thou liest
By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen
O murderous coxcomb
What should such a fool Do with so good a wife
Are there not stones in heaven But what serve for thunder
Precious villain
The woman falls sure he hath kill'd his wife
Ay ay
O lay me by my mistress’ side
He's gone but his wife's kill'd
Tis a notorious villain
I'll after that same villain For 'tis a damned slave
I am not valiant neither But every puny whipster gets my sword
But why should honor outlive honesty
Let it go all
What did thy song bode lady
Hark canst thou hear me
I will play the swan And die in music
Sings
Moor she was chaste she loved thee cruel Moor So come my soul to bliss as I speak true So speaking as I think I die I die
Uncle I must come forth
If thou attempt it it will cost thee dear Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer
Look in upon me then and speak with me Or naked as I am I will assault thee
What is the matter
Behold I have a weapon A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier's thigh
I have seen the day That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop
But O vain boast
Who can control his fate
Tis not so now
Be not afraid though you do see me weapon'd Here is my journey's end here is my butt And very seamark of my utmost sail
Do you go back dismay'd
Tis a lost fear Man but a rush against Othello's breast And he retires
Where should Othello go
Now how dost thou look now
O ill starr'd wench
Pale as thy smock
When we shall meet at compt This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven And fiends will snatch at it
O cursed cursed slave
Whip me ye devils From the possession of this heavenly sight
Blow me about in winds
Roast me in sulphur
Wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire
O Desdemon
dead Desdemon
dead
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man
Where is that viper
Bring the villain forth
I look down towards his feet but that's a fable
If that thou be'st a devil I cannot kill thee
Wrench his sword from him
I bleed sir but not kill'd
I am not sorry neither
I'ld have thee live For in my sense 'tis happiness to die
O thou Othello that wert once so good What shall be said to thee
Why anything An honorable murderer if you will For nought did I in hate but all in honor
This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death
Ay
Dear general I never gave you cause
I do believe it and I ask your pardon
Will you I pray demand that demidevil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
From this time forth I never will speak word
What not to pray
Torments will ope your lips
Well thou dost best
Sir you shall understand what hath befall'n Which as I think you know not
Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo And here another
The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo
O villain
Most heathenish and most gross
Now here's another discontented paper Found in his pocket too and this it seems Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain But that belike Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied him
O the pernicious caitiff
How came you Cassio by that handkerchief That was my wife's
I found it in my chamber And he himself confess'd but even now That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire
O fool
fool
fool
For this slave If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long It shall be his
You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state
Come bring away
Soft you a word or two before you go
I have done the state some service and they know't
No more of that
I pray you in your letters When you shall these unlucky deeds relate Speak of me as I am nothing extenuate Nor set down aught in malice
Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well Of one not easily jealous but being wrought Perplex'd in the extreme of one whose hand Like the base Indian threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes Albeit unused to the melting mood Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their medicinal gum
Set you down this And say besides that in Aleppo once Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state I took by the throat the circumcised dog And smote him thus
O bloody period
All that's spoke is marr'd
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee
No way but this Killing myself to die upon a kiss
This did I fear but thought he had no weapon For he was great of heart
O Spartan dog More fell than anguish hunger or the sea
Look on the tragic loading of this bed This is thy work
The object poisons sight Let it be hid
Gratiano keep the house And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor For they succeed on you
Myself will straight aboard and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie And young affection gapes to be his heir That fair for which love groan'd for and would die With tender Juliet match'd is now not fair
Now Romeo is belov'd and loves again Alike bewitched by the charm of looks But to his foe suppos'd he must complain And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks
Gregory on my word we'll not carry coals
No for then we should be colliers
I mean an we be in choler we'll draw
Ay while you live draw your neck out of the collar
I strike quickly being moved
But thou art not quickly moved to strike
A dog of the house of Montague moves me
Tis all one
When I have fought with the men I will be civil with the maids I will cut off their heads
Ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads
Take it in what sense thou wilt
Tis well thou art not fish if thou hadst thou hadst been poor John
My naked weapon is out
How
turn thy back and run
Fear me not
No marry
I fear thee
Let us take the law of our sides let them begin
I will frown as I pass by and let them take it as they list
Do you bite your thumb at us sir
I do bite my thumb sir
Do you bite your thumb at us sir
No sir I do not bite my thumb at you sir but I bite my thumb sir
Do you quarrel sir
Quarrel sir
No sir
But if you do sir I am for you
I serve as good a man as you
No better
Well sir
Say ‘better’ Here comes one of my master's kinsmen
Yes better sir
You lie
You know not what you do
What art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
I do but keep the peace
Put up thy sword Or manage it to part these men with me
Have at thee coward
Clubs bills and partisans
Strike
beat them down
Down with the Capulets
Down with the Montagues
What noise is this
Give me my long sword ho
A crutch a crutch
Why call you for a sword
My sword I say
Old Montague is come And flourishes his blade in spite of me
Thou villain Capulet Hold me not let me go
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe
Rebellious subjects enemies to peace Profaners of this neighbour stained steel  Will they not hear
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word By thee old Capulet and Montague Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets And made Verona's ancient citizens Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments To wield old partisans in hands as old Canker’d with peace to part your canker'd hate
If ever you disturb our streets again Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
Once more on pain of death all men depart
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
Speak nephew were you by when it began
Here were the servants of your adversary And yours close fighting ere I did approach
O where is Romeo
Saw you him to day
Right glad I am he was not at this fray
I measuring his affections by my own Which then most sought where most might not be found Being one too many by my weary self  Pursu'd my humour not pursuing his And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me
My noble uncle do you know the cause
I neither know it nor can learn of him
Have you importun'd him by any means
Both by myself and many other friends But he his own affections’ counsellor Is to himself I will not say how true  But to himself so secret and so close So far from sounding and discovery As is the bud bit with an envious worm Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air Or dedicate his beauty to the sun
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift
Come madam let's away Good morrow cousin
Is the day so young
But new struck nine
Ay me
sad hours seem long
Was that my father that went hence so fast
It was
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours
Not having that which having makes them short
In love
Out  Of love
Out of her favour where I am in love
Alas that love so gentle in his view Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
Alas that love whose view is muffled still Should without eyes see pathways to his will
Where shall we dine
O me
What fray was here
Yet tell me not for I have heard it all
O loving hate
O any thing of nothing first create
O heavy lightness
serious vanity
Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms
Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
This love feel I that feel no love in this
Dost thou not laugh
No coz I rather weep
Good heart at what
At thy good heart's oppression
Why such is love's transgression
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest With more of thine
This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs Being purg'd a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers’ tears
What is it else
A madness most discreet A choking gall and a preserving sweet
Farewell my coz
Soft
I will go along
An if you leave me so you do me wrong
Tut
Tell me in sadness who is that you love
What shall I groan and tell thee
Groan
Why no But sadly tell me who
In sadness cousin I do love a woman
I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd
A right good markman
And she's fair I love
A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
Well in that hit you miss
She will not stay the siege of loving terms Nor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes Nor ope her lap to saint seducing gold
O she's rich in beauty only poor That when she dies with beauty dies her store
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste For beauty starv'd with her severity Cuts beauty off from all posterity
She is too fair too wise wisely too fair To merit bliss by making me despair
She hath forsworn to love and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now
Be rul'd by me forget to think of her
O teach me how I should forget to think
Tis the way To call hers exquisite in question more
Show me a mistress that is passing fair What doth her beauty serve but as a note Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair
Farewell
Thou canst not teach me to forget
I'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt
But Montague is bound as well as I In penalty alike and 'tis not hard I think For men so old as we to keep the peace
Of honourable reckoning are you both And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long
But now my lord what say you to my suit
Younger than she are happy mothers made
And too soon marr'd are those so early made
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she She is the hopeful lady of my earth
But woo her gentle Paris get her heart My will to her consent is but a part
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love and you among the store One more most welcome makes my number more
At my poor house look to behold this night Earth treading stars that make dark heaven light
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well apparell'd April on the heel Of limping Winter treads even such delight Among fresh female buds shall you this night Inherit at my house
Hear all all see And like her most whose merit most shall be Which amongst view of many mine being one May stand in number though in reck'ning none
Come go with me
It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets but I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ
I must to the learned
In good time
Take thou some new infection to thy eye And the rank poison of the old will die
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that
For what I pray thee
For your broken shin
Why Romeo art thou mad
Not mad but bound more than a madman is Shut up in Prison kept without my food Whipp'd and tormented and– God eve good fellow
I pray sir can you read
Ay mine own fortune in my misery
Perhaps you have learned it without book
But I pray can you read any thing you see
Ay If I know the letters and the language
Ye say honestly
Rest you merry
Stay fellow I can read
Whither should they come
Up
Whither to supper
To our house
Whose house
My master's
Indeed I should have ask'd you that before
Now I'll tell you without asking
My master is the great rich Capulet and if you be not of the house of Montagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine
Rest you merry
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st With all the admired beauties of Verona
Go thither and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show And I will make thee think thy swan a crow
One fairer than my love
The all seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun
I'll go along no such sight to be shown But to rejoice in splendour of my own
Nurse where's my daughter
Call her forth to me
Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come
What lamb
what ladybird
God forbid
Where's this girl
What Juliet
Your mother
Madam I am here
What is your will
This is the matter Nurse give leave awhile We must talk in secret
Nurse come back again I have remember'd me thou shalt hear our counsel
Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age
Faith I can tell her age unto an hour
She's not fourteen
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth  And yet to my teen be it spoken I have but four  She is not fourteen
How long is it now To Lammastide
A fortnight and odd days
Even or odd of all days in the year Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls
Were of an age
Well Susan is with God She was too good for me
But as I said On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen That shall she marry I remember it well
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it) Of all the days of the year upon that day For I had then laid wormwood to my dug Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
Nay I do bear a brain
A’ was a merry man) took up the child
Yea’ quoth he ‘dost thou fall upon thy face
I warrant an I should live a thousand years I never should forget it
Yea’ quoth my husband ‘fall'st upon thy face
Peace I have done
God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd
An I might live to see thee married once I have my wish
Marry that ‘marry’ is the very theme I came to talk of
Tell me daughter Juliet How stands your disposition to be married
It is an honour that I dream not of
Well think of marriage now
Younger than you Here in Verona ladies of esteem Are made already mothers
By my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid
Thus then in brief The valiant Paris seeks you for his love
A man young lady
lady such a man As all the world  why he's a man of wax
Verona's summer hath not such a flower
Nay he's a flower in faith a very flower
What say you
Can you love the gentleman
The fish lives in the sea and 'tis much pride For fair without the fair within to hide
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory That in gold clasps locks in the golden story So shall you share all that he doth possess By having him making yourself no less
No less
Nay bigger
Women grow by men
Speak briefly can you like of Paris’ love
I'll look to like if looking liking move But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly
Madam the guests are come supper serv'd up you call'd my young lady ask'd for the nurse curs'd in the pantry and everything in extremity
We follow thee
Juliet the County stays
Go girl seek happy nights to happy days
What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
Or shall we on without apology
The date is out of such prolixity
Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance
Not I believe me
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move
You are a lover
Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers and so bound I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
Under love's heavy burden do I sink
And to sink in it should you burden love  Too great oppression for a tender thing
Is love a tender thing
It is too rough Too rude too boist'rous and it pricks like thorn
Give me a case to put my visage in
A visor for a visor
What care I What curious eye doth quote deformities
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
Come knock and enter and no sooner in But every man betake him to his legs
A torch for me
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase I'll be a candle holder and look on The game was ne'er so fair and I am done
dun's the mouse the constable's own word
Nay that's not so
I mean sir in delay We waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
Take our good meaning for our judgment sits Five times in that ere once in our five wits
And we mean well in going to this mask But 'tis no wit to go
Why may one ask
I dreamt a dream to night
And so did I
Well what was yours
That dreamers often lie
In bed asleep while they do dream things true
O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades Of healths five fathom deep and then anon Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again
This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs Which once untangled much misfortune bodes This is the hag when maids lie on their backs That presses them and learns them first to bear Making them women of good carriage
True I talk of dreams Which are the children of an idle brain Begot of nothing but vain fantasy Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north And being anger'd puffs away from thence Turning his face to the dew dropping south
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
Supper is done and we shall come too late
But He that hath the steerage of my course Direct my sail
On lusty gentlemen
Strike drum
Where's Potpan that he helps not to take away
He shift a trencher
he scrape a trencher
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands and they unwash'd too 'tis a foul thing
Away with the joint stools remove the court cupboard look to the plate
Good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as thou lovest me let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell
Ay boy ready
You are look'd for and call'd for ask'd for and sought for in the great chamber
Welcome gentlemen
Ladies that have their toes Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you
Ah ha my mistresses
which of you all Will now deny to dance
She that makes dainty She I'll swear hath corns
Am I come near ye now
Welcome gentlemen
You are welcome gentlemen
Come musicians play
A hall a hall
give room
Ah sirrah this unlook'd for sport comes well
By'r Lady thirty years
What man
Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio Come Pentecost as quickly as it will Some five and twenty years and then we mask'd
Tis more 'tis more
His son is elder sir His son is thirty
Will you tell me that
His son was but a ward two years ago
What lady's that which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight
I know not sir
O she doth teach the torches to burn bright
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear  Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows
The measure done I'll watch her place of stand And touching hers make blessed my rude hand
Did my heart love till now
Forswear it sight
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night
This by his voice should be a Montague
Fetch me my rapier boy
What dares the slave Come hither cover'd with an antic face To fleer and scorn at our solemnity
Now by the stock and honour of my kin To strike him dead I hold it not a sin
Why how now kinsman
Wherefore storm you so
Uncle this is a Montague our foe A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night
Young Romeo is it
Tis he that villain Romeo
Content thee gentle coz let him alone
He bears him like a portly gentleman And to say truth Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well govern'd youth
I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement
Therefore be patient take no note of him
It is my will the which if thou respect Show a fair presence and put off these frowns An ill beseeming semblance for a feast
It fits when such a villain is a guest
What goodman boy
Am I the master here or you
Go to
You'll not endure him
You will set cock a hoop
you'll be the man
Why uncle 'tis a shame
Go to go to
You are a saucy boy
Is't so indeed
You must contrary me
I'll make you quiet what Cheerly my hearts
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
I will withdraw but this intrusion shall Now seeming sweet convert to bitt'rest gall
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine the gentle fine is this My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much Which mannerly devotion shows in this For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss
Have not saints lips and holy palmers too
Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
Saints do not move though grant for prayers’ sake
Then move not while my prayer's effect I take
Thus from my lips by thine my sin is purg'd
Then have my lips the sin that they have took
Sin from my lips
O trespass sweetly urg'd
Give me my sin again
You kiss by th’ book
Madam your mother craves a word with you
What is her mother
Marry bachelor Her mother is the lady of the house
And a good lady and a wise and virtuous
Is she a Capulet
O dear account
my life is my foe's debt
Away be gone the sport is at the best
Ay so I fear the more is my unrest
Is it e'en so
More torches here
Come on then let's to bed
Ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late I'll to my rest
Come hither Nurse
What is yon gentleman
The son and heir of old Tiberio
What's he that now is going out of door
Marry that I think be young Petruchio
What's he that follows there that would not dance
I know not
His name is Romeo and a Montague The only son of your great enemy
My only love sprung from my only hate
Too early seen unknown and known too late
Prodigious birth of love it is to me That I must love a loathed enemy
What's this
what's this
A rhyme I learn'd even now Of one I danc'd withal
Anon anon
Come let's away the strangers all are gone
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse In half an hour she promis'd to return
Perchance she cannot meet him
That's not so
O she is lame
Love's heralds should be thoughts Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams Driving back shadows over low'ring hills
Therefore do nimble pinion'd doves draw Love And therefore hath the wind swift Cupid wings
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey and from nine till twelve Is three long hours yet she is not come
O God she comes
O honey nurse what news
Hast thou met with him
Send thy man away
Peter stay at the gate
Now good sweet nurse O Lord why look'st thou sad
What a jaunt have I had
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news
Jesu what haste
Can you not stay awhile
Do you not see that I am out of breath
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
Is thy news good or bad
Answer to that
Say either and I'll stay the circumstance
Let me be satisfied is't good or bad
Romeo
He is not the flower of courtesy but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb
Go thy ways wench serve God
What have you din'd at home
What says he of our marriage
What of that
Lord how my head aches
What a head have I
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces
My back o’ t’ other side ah my back my back
Beshrew your heart for sending me about To catch my death with jaunting up and down
I’ faith I am sorry that thou art not well
Sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love
Your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous and a kind and a handsome and I warrant a virtuous Where is your mother
Where is my mother
Why she is within
Where should she be
How oddly thou reply'st
Your love says like an honest gentleman “Where is your mother”’ O God's Lady dear
Are you so hot
Henceforward do your messages yourself
Here's such a coil
Come what says Romeo
Have you got leave to go to shrift to day
I have
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence’ cell There stays a husband to make you a wife
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks They'll be in scarlet straight at any news
Hie you to church I must another way To fetch a ladder by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark
I am the drudge and toil in your delight But you shall bear the burden soon at night
Go I'll to dinner hie you to the cell
Hie to high fortune
Honest nurse farewell
Can I go forward when my heart is here
Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
Romeo
He is wise And on my life hath stol'n him home to bed
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall
Call good Mercutio
Nay I'll conjure too
Romeo
humours
madman
passion
lover
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
Cry but ‘Ay me’ pronounce but ‘love’ and ‘dove’ Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word One nickname for her purblind son and heir Young Adam Cupid he that shot so trim When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid
He heareth not he stirreth not be moveth not The ape is dead and I must conjure him
An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
This cannot anger him
Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle Of some strange nature letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down
That were some spite my invocation Is fair and honest in his mistress’ name I conjure only but to raise up him
Come he hath hid himself among these trees To be consorted with the humorous night
Blind is his love and best befits the dark
If love be blind love cannot hit the mark
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone
Romeo good night
I'll to my truckle bed This field bed is too cold for me to sleep
Come shall we go
Go then for 'tis in vain ‘To seek him here that means not to be found
He jests at scars that never felt a wound
But soft
What light through yonder window breaks
It is the East and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Be not her maid since she is envious
Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it
Cast it off
It is my lady O it is my love
O that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing
What of that
I am too bold 'tis not to me she speaks
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven Having some business do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return
What if her eyes were there they in her head
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
O that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek
Ay me
She speaks
O speak again bright angel
for thou art As glorious to this night being o'er my head As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the white upturned wond'ring eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy pacing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air
O Romeo Romeo
Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this
O be some other name
What's in a name
That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet
So Romeo would were he not Romeo call'd Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title
Romeo doff thy name And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself
I take thee at thy word
Call me but love and I'll be new baptiz'd Henceforth I never will be Romeo
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my counsel
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am
My name dear saint is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee
Had I it written I would tear the word
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words Of that tongue's utterance yet I know the sound
How cam'st thou hither tell me and wherefore
If they do see thee they will murder thee
Alack there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords
Look thou but sweet And I am proof against their enmity
I would not for the world they saw thee here
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes And but thou love me let them find me here
My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued wanting of thy love
By whose direction found'st thou out this place
I am no pilot yet wert thou as far As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea I would adventure for such merchandise
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to night
Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny What I have spoke but farewell complement
Dost thou love me
I know thou wilt say ‘Ay’ And I will take thy word
Yet if thou swear'st Thou mayst prove false
At lovers’ perjuries They say Jove laughs
O gentle Romeo If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
I should have been more strange I must confess But that thou overheard'st ere I was ware My true love's passion
Therefore pardon me And not impute this yielding to light love Which the dark night hath so discovered
Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit tree tops  O swear not by the moon the inconstant moon That monthly changes in her circled orb Lest that thy love prove likewise variable
What shall I swear by
Do not swear at all Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self Which is the god of my idolatry And I'll believe thee
If my heart's dear love  Well do not swear
This bud of love by summer's ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
Good night good night
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
What satisfaction canst thou have to night
Th’ exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it And yet I would it were to give again
Would'st thou withdraw it
For what purpose love
But to be frank and give it thee again
And yet I wish but for the thing I have
My bounty is as boundless as the sea My love as deep the more I give to thee The more I have for both are infinite
I hear some noise within
Dear love adieu
Anon good nurse
Sweet Montague be true
Stay but a little I will come again
O blessed blessed night
I am afeard Being in night all this is but a dream Too flattering sweet to be substantial
Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
If that thy bent of love be honourable Thy purpose marriage send me word to morrow By one that I'll procure to come to thee Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world
Madam
I come anon But if thou meanest not well I do beseech thee  Madam
By and by I come  To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief
To morrow will I send
So thrive my soul  A thousand times good night
A thousand times the worse to want thy light
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books But love from love towards school with heavy looks
Romeo hist
O for a falconer's voice To lure this tassel gentle back again
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of my Romeo's name
It is my soul that calls upon my name
How silver sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night Like softest music to attending ears
Romeo
My dear
What o'clock to morrow Shall I send to thee
By the hour of nine
I will not fail
Tis twenty years till then
I have forgot why I did call thee back
Let me stand here till thou remember it
I shall forget to have thee still stand there Remembering how I love thy company
And I'll still stay to have thee still forget Forgetting any other home but this
I would I were thy bird
Sweet so would I
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
Good night good night
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell His help to crave and my dear hap to tell
The grey ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels
Now ere the sun advance his burning eye The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry I must up fill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious juiced flowers
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb
What is her burying grave that is her womb And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find Many for many virtues excellent None but for some and yet all different
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied And vice sometime's by action dignified
Two such opposed kings encamp them still In man as well as herbs grace and rude will And where the worser is predominant Full soon the canker death eats up that plant
Good morrow father
Benedicite
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
Young son it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye And where care lodges sleep will never lie But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature Or if not so then here I hit it right  Our Romeo hath not been in bed to night
That last is true the sweeter rest was mine
God pardon sin
Wast thou with Rosaline
With Rosaline my ghostly father
No
I have forgot that name and that name's woe
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again
I have been feasting with mine enemy Where on a sudden one hath wounded me That's by me wounded
Holy Saint Francis
What a change is here
Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear So soon forsaken
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
How much salt water thrown away in waste To season love that of it doth not taste
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
And art thou chang'd
Pronounce this sentence then Women may fall when there's no strength in men
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline
For doting not for loving pupil mine
And bad'st me bury love
Not in a grave To lay one in another out to have
I pray thee chide not
She whom I love now Doth grace for grace and love for love allow
The other did not so
But come young waverer come go with me
Wisely and slow
They stumble that run fast
Where the devil should this Romeo be
Came he not home to night
Why that same pale hard hearted wench that Rosaline torments him so that he will sure run mad
Tybalt the kinsman to old Capulet Hath sent a letter to his father's house
A challenge on my life
Romeo will answer it
Any man that can write may answer a letter
Nay he will answer the letter's master how he dares being dared
Alas poor Romeo he is already dead
Why what is Tybalt
More than Prince of Cats I can tell you
O he's the courageous captain of compliments
He fights as you sing pricksong keeps time distance and proportion rests me his minim rest one two and the third in your bosom
Ah the immortal passado
the punto reverso
the hai
The what
The pox of such antic lisping affecting fantasticoes these new tuners of accent
By Jesu a very good blade
a very tall man
O their bones their bones
Without his roe like a dried herring
O flesh flesh how art thou fishified
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in
There's a French salutation to your French slop
You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night
Good morrow to you both
What counterfeit did I give you
That's as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams
Meaning to curtsy
Thou hast most kindly hit it
A most courteous exposition
Nay I am the very pink of courtesy
Pink for flower
Right
Why then is my pump well flower'd
Well said
Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it is worn the jest may remain after the wearing solely singular
O single sold jest solely singular for the singleness
or I'll cry a match
Nay if our wits run the wild goose chase I am done for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole five
Was I with you there for the goose
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest
Nay good goose bite not
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most sharp sauce
And is it not then well serv'd in to a sweet goose
O here's a wit of cheverel that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad
I stretch it out for that word ‘broad’ which added to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
Why is not this better now than groaning for love
Now art thou sociable now art thou Romeo now art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature
For this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
Stop there stop there
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
Here's goodly gear
A sail a sail
Peter
Anon
My fan Peter
Good Peter to hide her face for her fan's the fairer face of the two
God ye good morrow gentlemen
God ye good den fair gentlewoman
Is it good den
Tis no less I tell ye for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon
Out upon you
What a man are you
One gentlewoman that God hath made for himself to mar
Gentlemen can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo
I can tell you but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him
I am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse
You say well
Yea is the worst well
If you be he sir I desire some confidence with you
She will indite him to some supper
A bawd a bawd a bawd
So ho
What hast thou found
An old hare hoar And an old hare hoar Is very good meat in Lent But a hare that is hoar Is too much for a score When it hoars ere it be spent
Romeo will you come to your father's
We'll to dinner thither
I will follow you
Marry farewell
I pray you sir what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery
A gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month
An’ a speak anything against me I'll take him down an’ a were lustier than he is and twenty such jacks and if I cannot I'll find those that shall
Scurvy knave
And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side
Now afore God I am so vexed that every part about me quivers
Scurvy knave
Nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress
I pro  test unto thee  Good heart and i’ faith I will tell her as much
What wilt thou tell her nurse
Thou dost not mark me
Bid her devise some means to come to shrift This afternoon And there she shall at Friar Laurence’ cell Be shriv'd and married
Here is for thy pains
No truly sir not a penny
This afternoon sir
Well she shall be there
And stay good nurse behind the abbey wall
Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair Which to the high topgallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night
Now God in heaven bless thee
Hark you sir
What say'st thou my dear nurse
Is your man secret
Did you ne'er hear say Two may keep counsel putting one away
I warrant thee my man's as true as steel
Well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady
Lord Lord
when 'twas a little prating thing O there is a nobleman in town one Paris that would fain lay knife aboard but she good soul had as lieve see a toad a very toad as see him
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man but I'll warrant you when I say so she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world
Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter
Ay nurse what of that
Both with an R Ah mocker
that's the dog's name
Commend me to thy lady
Ay a thousand times
Exit Romeo
Anon
Peter take my fan and go before and apace
So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after hours with sorrow chide us not
Amen amen
But come what sorrow can It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight
Do thou but close our hands with holy words Then love devouring death do what he dare  It is enough I may but call her mine
These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die like fire and powder Which as they kiss consume
The sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite
Here comes the Lady
O so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint
Good even to my ghostly confessor
Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
As much to him else is his thanks too much
Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath This neighbour air and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter
Come come with me and we will make short work For by your leaves you shall not stay alone Till Holy Church incorporate two in one
I pray thee good Mercutio let's retire
Thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says ‘God send me no need of thee’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need
Am I like such a fellow
Come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be moved
And what to
Nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for one would kill the other
Thou
why thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast
Thy head is as full of quar rels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling
Thou hast quar rell'd with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter
The fee simple
O simple
By my head here come the Capulets
By my heel I care not
Follow me close for I will speak to them
And but one word with one of us
Couple it with something make it a word and a blow
You shall find me apt enough to that sir an you will give me occasion
Could you not take some occasion without giving
Mercutio thou consortest with Romeo
What dost thou make us minstrels
An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords
We talk here in the public haunt of men
Well peace be with you sir
Here comes my man
But I'll be hang'd sir if he wear your livery
Marry go before to field he'll be your follower
Your worship in that sense may call him man
Tybalt the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting
Villain am I none
Therefore farewell
I see thou knowest me not
Boy this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me therefore turn and draw
O calm dishonourable vile submission
Alla stoccata carries it away
Tybalt you ratcatcher will you walk
What would'st thou have with me
Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears
Make haste lest mine be about your ears ere it be out
I am for you
Gentle Mercutio put thy rapier up
Come sir your passado
Gentlemen for shame
forbear this outrage
Tybalt Mercutio the Prince expressly hath Forbid this bandying in Verona streets
Hold Tybalt
Good Mercutio
I am sped
Is he gone and hath nothing
What art thou hurt
Where is my page
Go villain fetch a surgeon
No 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but 'tis enough 'twill serve
Ask for me to morrow and you shall find me a grave man
I am peppered I warrant for this world
A plague o’ both your houses
Zounds a dog a rat a mouse a cat to scratch a man to death
a braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic
Why the devil came you between us
I was hurt under your arm
I thought all for the best
Help me into some house Benvolio Or I shall faint
A plague o’ both your houses
They have made worms’ meat of me
I have it And soundly too
Your houses
That gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds Which too untimely here did scorn the earth
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again
Away to heaven respective lenity And fire ey'd fury be my conduct now
Now Tybalt take the ‘villain’ back again That late thou gavest me for Mercutio's soul Is but a little way above our heads Staying for thine to keep him company
Either thou or I or both must go with him
Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence
This shall determine that
Romeo away be gone
The citizens are up and Tybalt slain
Stand not amaz'd
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken
Hence be gone away
O I am fortune's fool
Why dost thou stay
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio
Tybalt that murderer which way ran he
There lies that Tybalt
Where are the vile beginners of this fray
There lies the man slain by young Romeo That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio
Tybalt my cousin
O my brother's child
O Prince
O husband
O the blood is spill'd Of my dear kinsman
Prince as thou art true For blood of ours shed blood of Montague
O cousin cousin
Benvolio who began this bloody fray
Tybalt here slain whom Romeo's hand did slay
Romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink How nice the quarrel was and urg'd withal Your high displeasure
Romeo he cries aloud ‘Hold friends
This is the truth or let Benvolio die
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife And all those twenty could but kill one life
I beg for justice which thou Prince must give
Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live
Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
Not Romeo Prince he was Mercutio's friend His fault concludes but what the law should end The life of Tybalt
And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
Therefore use none
Let Romeo hence in haste Else when he is found that hour is his last
Bear hence this body and attend our will
Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
Gallop apace you fiery footed steeds Towards Phoebus’ lodging
Such a wagoner As Phaeton would whip you to the west And bring in cloudy night immediately
Spread thy close curtain love performing night That runaway eyes may wink and Romeo Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen
Come civil night Thou sober suited matron all in black And learn me how to lose a winning match Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
Hood my unmann'd blood bating in my cheeks With thy black mantle till strange love grown bold Think true love acted simple modesty
Come gentle night come loving black brow'd night Give me my Romeo and when he shall die Take him and cut him out in little stars And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun
O I have bought the mansion of a love But not possess'd it and though I am sold Not yet enjoy'd
So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new robes And may not wear them
What hast thou there
the cords That Romeo bid thee fetch
Ay ay the cords
Ay me
what news
Why dost thou wring thy hands
Ah well a day
he's dead he's dead he's dead
We are undone lady we are undone
Alack the day
he's gone he's kill'd he's dead
Can heaven be so envious
Romeo can Though heaven cannot
O Romeo Romeo
Who ever would have thought it
Romeo
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell
Hath Romeo slain himself
Say thou but ‘I’ And that bare vowel ‘I’ shall poison more Than the death darting eye of cockatrice
I am not I if there be such an ‘I’ Or those eyes shut that make thee answer ‘I’ If he be slain say ‘I’ or if not ‘no’ Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
here on his manly breast
O break my heart
poor bankrout break at once
Vile earth to earth resign end motion here And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier
O courteous Tybalt
What storm is this that blows so contrary
Is Romeo slaught'red and is Tybalt dead
My dear lov'd cousin and my dearer lord
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
For who is living if those two are gone
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished Romeo that kill'd him he is banished
O God
Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood
O serpent heart hid with a flow'ring face
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
Beautiful tyrant
fiend angelical
Dove feather'd raven
wolvish ravening lamb
Despised substance of divinest show
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st  A damned saint an honourable villain
O nature what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound
O that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace
There's no trust No faith no honesty in men all perjur'd All forsworn all naught all dissemblers
Ah where's my man
Give me some aqua vitae
These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
Shame come to Romeo
Blister'd be thy tongue For such a wish
He was not born to shame
Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd Sole monarch of the universal earth
O what a beast was I to chide at him
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband
Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name When I thy three hours’ wife have mangled it
But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband
Back foolish tears back to your native spring
Your tributary drops belong to woe Which you mistaking offer up to joy
My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain And Tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband
Some word there was worser than Tybalt's death That murdered me
I would forget it fain But O it presses to my memory Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds
Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished’ That ‘banished’ that one word ‘banished’ Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death ‘Romeo is banished’  to speak that word Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet All slain all dead
Where is my father and my mother nurse
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse
Will you go to them
I will bring you thither
Wash they his wounds with tears
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry for Romeo's banishment
Take up those cords
Poor ropes you are beguil'd Both you and I for Romeo is exil'd
He made you for a highway to my bed But I a maid die maiden widowed
Hie to your chamber
I'll find Romeo To comfort you
I wot well where he is
Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night
I'll to him he is hid at Laurence’ cell
O find him
give this ring to my true knight And bid him come to take his last farewell
Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
Affliction is enamour’d of thy parts And thou art wedded to calamity
Father what news
What is the Prince's doom
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand That I yet know not
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips  Not body's death but body's banishment
Ha banishment
Be merciful say ‘death’ For exile hath more terror in his look Much more than death
Do not say ‘banishment’ Hence from Verona art thou banished
Be patient for the world is broad and wide
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory torture hell itself
Calling death ‘banishment’ Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe And smilest upon the stroke that murders me
O deadly sin
O rude unthankfulness
Thy fault our law calls death but the kind Prince Taking thy part hath rush'd aside the law And turn'd that black word death to banishment
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not
Tis torture and not mercy
Heaven is here Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog And little mouse every unworthy thing Live here in heaven and may look on her But Romeo may not
More validity More honourable state more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo
This may flies do when I from this must fly They are free men but I am banished
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death
O thou wilt speak again of banishment
Yet ‘banished’
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet Displant a town reverse a prince's doom It helps not it prevails not
Talk no more
O then I see that madmen have no ears
How should they when that wise men have no eyes
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love An hour but married Tybalt murdered Doting like me and like me banished Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground as I do now Taking the measure of an unmade grave
Good Romeo hide thyself
Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans Mist like infold me from the search of eyes
Hark how they knock
Who's there
Who knocks so hard
Whence come you
What's your will
Welcome then
There on the ground with his own tears made drunk
O he is even in my mistress’ case Just in her case
O woeful sympathy
Piteous predicament
Even so lies she Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
Nurse  Ah sir
ah sir
Well death's the end of all
Spakest thou of Juliet
How is it with her
Doth not she think me an old murderer Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy With blood remov'd but little from her own
Where is she
and how doth she
and what says My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love
O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps And now falls on her bed and then starts up And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries And then down falls again
As if that name Shot from the deadly level of a gun Did murder her as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman
O tell me friar tell me In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge
Tell me that I may sack The hateful mansion
Hold thy desperate hand
Art thou a man
Or ill beseeming beast in seeming both
Thou hast amaz'd me
By my holy order I thought thy disposition better temper'd
Hast thou slain Tybalt
Wilt thou slay thyself
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives By doing damned hate upon thyself
Why railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax Digressing from the valour of a man Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish Thy wit that ornament to shape and love Misshapen in the conduct of them both Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask Is set afire by thine own ignorance And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence
What rouse thee man
Tybalt would kill thee But thou slewest Tybalt
There art thou happy too
The law that threat'ned death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile
There art thou happy
Take heed take heed for such die miserable
Go get thee to thy love as was decreed Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
But look thou stay not till the watch be set For then thou canst not pass to Mantua Where thou shalt live till we can find a time To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than thou went'st forth in lamentation
Go before Nurse
Commend me to thy lady And bid her hasten all the house to bed Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
Romeo is coming
O Lord I could have stay'd here all the night To hear good counsel
O what learning is
My lord I'll tell my lady you will come
Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
Here is a ring she bid me give you sir
Hie you make haste for it grows very late
How well my comfort is reviv'd by this
Sojourn in Mantua
I'll find out your man And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here
Give me thy hand
Tis late
But that a joy past joy calls out on me It were a grief so brief to part with thee
Farewell
Things have fall'n out sir so unluckily That we have had no time to move our daughter
Look you she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly And so did I
Well we were born to die
I promise you but for your company I would have been abed an hour ago
These times of woe afford no tune to woo
Madam good night
Commend me to your daughter
I will and know her mind early to morrow To night she's mew'd up to her heaviness
Sir Paris I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love
I think she will be rul'd In all respects by me nay more I doubt it not
what day is this
Monday my lord
Monday
ha ha
Well Wednesday is too soon
Thursday let it be  a Thursday tell her She shall be married to this noble earl
Will you be ready
Do you like this haste
We'll keep no great ado  a friend or two For hark you Tybalt being slain so late It may be thought we held him carelessly Being our kinsman if we revel much
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends And there an end
But what say you to Thursday
My lord I would that Thursday were to morrow
Well get you gone
A Thursday be it then
Afore me it is so very very late That we may call it early by and by
Good night
Wilt thou be gone
It is not yet near day
Believe me love it was the nightingale
It was the lark the herald of the morn No nightingale
Look love what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East
Night's candles are burnt out and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
I must be gone and live or stay and die
Yon light is not daylight I know it I
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer And light thee on thy way to Mantua
Therefore stay yet thou need'st not to be gone
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads
I have more care to stay than will to go
Come death and welcome
Juliet wills it so
How is't my soul
It is it is
It is the lark that sings so out of tune Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
Some say the lark makes sweet division This doth not so for she divideth us
More light and light more dark and dark our woes
Madam
Nurse
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
Then window let day in and let life out
Farewell farewell
One kiss and I'll descend
I must hear from thee every day in the hour For in a minute there are many days
O by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo
Farewell
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings love to thee
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again
I doubt it not and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our time to come
Methinks I see thee now thou art below As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
Either my eyesight fails or thou look'st pale
And trust me love in my eye so do you
Dry sorrow drinks our blood
O Fortune Fortune
all men call thee fickle
If thou art fickle what dost thou with him That is renown'd for faith
Be fickle Fortune For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back
Ho daughter
are you up
Who is't that calls
It is my lady mother
Is she not down so late or up so early
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither
Why how now Juliet
Madam I am not well
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death
What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
An if thou could'st thou could'st not make him live
Therefore have done
Some grief shows much of love But much of grief shows still some want of wit
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
So shall you feel the loss but not the friend Which you weep for
Feeling so the loss I cannot choose but ever weep the friend
Well girl thou weep'st not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him
What villain madam
That same villain Romeo
Villain and he be many miles asunder
God pardon him
I do with all my heart And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
That is because the traitor murderer lives
Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death
We will have vengeance for it fear thou not
Then weep no more
I'll send to one in Mantua Where that same banish'd runagate doth live Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied
Indeed I never shall be satisfied With Romeo till I behold him  dead   Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd
Madam if you could find out but a man To bear a poison I would temper it That Romeo should upon receipt thereof Soon sleep in quiet
O how my heart abhors To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him
Find thou the means and I'll find such a man
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings girl
And joy comes well in such a needy time
What are they I beseech your ladyship
Well well thou hast a careful father child One who to put thee from thy heaviness Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expects not nor I look'd not for
Marry my child early next Thursday morn The gallant young and noble gentleman The County Paris at Saint Peter's Church Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
These are news indeed
Here comes your father
Tell him so yourself And see how he will take it at your hands
When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew But for the sunset of my brother's son It rains downright
How now
a conduit girl
What still in tears
Evermore show'ring
How now wife
Have you delivered to her our decree
I would the fool were married to her grave
Soft
take me with you take me with you wife
Is she not proud
Doth she not count her blest Unworthy as she is that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
Not proud you have but thankful that you have
Proud can I never be of what I hate But thankful even for hate that is meant love
How how how how choplogic
What is this
Out you green sickness carrion
Out you baggage
You tallow face
Fie fie
what are you mad
Hang thee young baggage
disobedient wretch
I tell thee what get thee to church a Thursday Or never after look me in the face
Speak not reply not do not answer me
My fingers itch
Wife we scarce thought us blest That God had lent us but this only child But now I see this one is one too much And that we have a curse in having her
Out on her hilding
God in heaven bless her
You are to blame my lord to rate her so
And why my Lady Wisdom
I speak no treason
May not one speak
Peace you mumbling fool
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl For here we need it not
You are too hot
God's bread
It makes me mad
Graze where you will you shall not house with me
Thursday is near lay hand on heart advise An you be mine I'll give you to my friend An you be not hang beg starve die in the streets For by my soul I'll ne'er acknowledge thee Nor what is mine shall never do thee good
Trust to't
Bethink you
I'll not be forsworn
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds That sees into the bottom of my grief
O sweet my mother cast me not away
Delay this marriage for a month a week Or if you do not make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies
Talk not to me for I'll not speak a word
Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
How shall that faith return again to earth Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth
Alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself
What say'st thou
Hast thou not a word of joy
Some comfort Nurse
Faith here it is
Romeo is banish'd and all the world to nothing That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you Or if he do it needs must be by stealth
Then since the case so stands as now it doth I think it best you married with the County
O he's a lovely gentleman
Romeo's a dishclout to him
An eagle madam Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye As Paris hath
Beshrew my very heart I think you are happy in this second match For it excels your first or if it did not Your first is dead or 'twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him
Speak'st thou this from thy heart
And from my soul too Else beshrew them both
Amen
What
Well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
Go in and tell my lady I am gone Having displeas'd my father to Laurence’ cell To make confession and to be absolv'd
Marry I will and this is wisely done
Ancient damnation
O most wicked fiend
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Which she hath prais'd him with above compare So many thousand times
I'll to the friar to know his remedy
If all else fail myself have power to die
On Thursday sir
The time is very short
My father Capulet will have it so And I am nothing slow to slack his haste
You say you do not know the lady's mind
Uneven is the course I like it not
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death And therefore have I little talk'd of love For Venus smiles not in a house of tears
Now sir her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway And in his wisdom hastes our marriage To stop the inundation of her tears Which too much minded by herself alone May be put from her by society
Now do you know the reason of this haste
I would I knew not why it should be slow'd
Look sir here comes the lady toward my cell
Happily met my lady and my wife
That may be sir when I may be a wife
That may be must be love on Thursday next
Come you to make confession to this father
To answer that I should confess to you
Do not deny to him that you love me
I will confess to you that I love him
So will ye I am sure that you love me
If I do so it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face
Poor soul thy face is much abus'd with tears
The tears have got small victory by that For it was bad enough before their spite
Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report
That is no slander sir which is a truth And what I spake I spake it to my face
Thy face is mine and thou hast sland'red it
It may be so for it is not mine own
Are you at leisure holy father now Or shall I come to you at evening mass
My leisure serves me pensive daughter now
My lord we must entreat the time alone
God shield I should disturb devotion
Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
O shut the door
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it On Thursday next be married to this County
Tell me not friar that thou hear'st of this Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise And with this knife I'll help it presently
Therefore out of thy long experienc'd time Give me some present counsel or behold 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the umpire arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring
Be not so long to speak
I long to die If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy
Hold daughter
I do spy a kind of hope Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent
If rather than to marry County Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame That cop’st with death himself to scape from it And if thou dar'st I'll give thee remedy
Hold then
Go home be merry give consent To marry Paris
Wednesday is to morrow
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
In the mean time against thou shalt awake Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift And hither shall he come and he and I Will watch thy waking and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
Give me give me
O tell not me of fear
Hold
I'll send a friar with speed To Mantua with my letters to thy lord
Love give me strength
and strength shall help afford
Farewell dear father
So many guests invite as here are writ
Sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks
You shall have none ill sir for I'll try if they can lick their fingers
How canst thou try them so
Marry sir 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me
Go begone
We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time
What is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence
Ay forsooth
Well be may chance to do some good on her
A peevish self will'd harlotry it is
See where she comes from shrift with merry look
How now my headstrong
Where have you been gadding
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests and am enjoin'd By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon
Pardon I beseech you
Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you
Send for the County
Go tell him of this
I'll have this knot knit up to morrow morning
I met the youthful lord at Laurence’ cell And gave him what becomed love I might Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty
Why I am glad on't
This is well
Stand up
This is as't should be
Let me see the County
Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither
Now afore God this reverend holy friar All our whole city is much bound to him
Nurse will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me to morrow
No not till Thursday
There is time enough
Go nurse go with her
We'll to church to morrow
We shall be short in our provision
Tis now near night
Tush I will stir about And all things shall be well I warrant thee wife
Go thou to Juliet help to deck up her
What ho
They are all forth well I will walk myself To County Paris to prepare him up Against to morrow
My heart is wondrous light Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd
What are you busy ho
Need you my help
No madam we have cull'd such necessaries As are behoveful for our state to morrow
So please you let me now be left alone And let the nurse this night sit up with you For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business
Good night
Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
Farewell
God knows when we shall meet again
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life
I'll call them back again to comfort me
Nurse  What should she do here
My dismal scene I needs must act alone
Come vial
What if this mixture do not work at all
Shall I be married then to morrow morning
No No
This shall forbid it
Lie thou there
What if it be a poison which the friar Subtly hath ministr'd to have me dead Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd Because he married me before to Romeo
I will not entertain so bad a thought
How if when I am laid into the tomb I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me
There's a fearful point
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
O look
methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point
Stay Tybalt stay
Romeo I come
this do I drink to thee
Hold take these keys and fetch more spices Nurse
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry
Come stir stir stir
The second cock hath crow'd The curfew bell hath rung 'tis three o'clock
Look to the bak'd meats good Angelica Spare not for cost
Faith you'll be sick to morrow For this night's watching
No not a whit
Ay you have been a mouse hunt in your time But I will watch you from such watching now
A jealous hood a jealous hood
Now fellow what is there
Things for the cook sir but I know not what
Make haste make haste
Sirrah fetch drier logs
Call Peter he will show thee where they are
I have a head sir that will find out logs And never trouble Peter for the matter
Mass and well said a merry whoreson ha
Thou shalt be loggerheadGood faith'tis day
The County will be here with music straight For so he said he would
I hear him near
Nurse
Wife
What ho
What nurse I say
I'll go and chat with Paris
Hie make haste Make haste
Mistress

Juliet
Fast I warrant her she
Why lamb
why lady
Fie you slug abed
Why love I say
madam
sweetheart
Why bride
What not a word
You take your pennyworths now
Sleep for a week for the next night I warrant The County Paris hath set up his rest That you shall rest but little
God forgive me
I needs must wake her
Madam madam madam
Ay let the County take you in your bed
Will it not be
I must needs wake you
Lady
lady
lady
Alas alas
Help help
My lady's dead
O well a day that ever I was born
Some aqua vitae ho
My lord
my lady
What noise is here
O lamentable day
What is the matter
Look look
O heavy day
O me O me
My child my only life
Revive look up or I will die with thee
Help help
Call help
For shame bring Juliet forth her lord is come
She's dead deceas'd she's dead
Alack the day
Alack the day she's dead she's dead she's dead
Ha
let me see her
Out alas
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field
O lamentable day
O woful time
Death that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
Ready to go but never to return
O son the night before thy wedding day Hath Death lain with thy wife
See there she lies Flower as she was deflowered by him
I will die And leave him all
Life living all is Death's
Have I thought long to see this morning's face And doth it give me such a sight as this
Accurs'd unhappy wretched hateful day
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labour of his pilgrimage
But one poor one one poor and loving child But one thing to rejoice and solace in And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight
O woe
O woeful woeful woeful day
Most lamentable day most woeful day That ever ever I did yet behold
O day
O day
O day
O hateful day
Never was seen so black a day as this
O woeful day
O woeful day
Beguil'd divorced wronged spited slain
O love
O life
not life but love in death
Despis'd distressed hated martyr'd kill'd
Uncomfortable time why cam'st thou now To murder murder our solemnity
O child
O child
my soul and not my child
Dead art thou dead
alack my child is dead And with my child my joys are buried
Peace ho for shame
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions
Your part in her you could not keep from death But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
O in this love you love your child so ill That you run mad seeing that she is well
Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary On this fair corse and as the custom is In all her best array bear her to church For though fond nature bids us all lament Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment
Sir go you in and madam go with him And go Sir Paris
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave
Faith we may put up our pipes and be gone
Ay by my troth the case may be amended
Not a dump we
Tis no time to play now
You will not then
No
I will then give it you soundly
What will you give us
Then will I give you the serving creature
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate
I will carry no crotchets
I'll re you I'll fa you
Do you note me
An you re us and fa us you note us
Pray you put up your dagger and put out your wit
Then have at you with my wit
I will dry beat you with an iron wit and put up my iron dagger
Answer me like men
Marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound
Pretty
What say you Hugh Rebeck
I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver
Pretty too
What say you James Soundpost
Faith I know not what to say
O I cry you mercy
you are the singer
I will say for you
It is ‘music with her silver sound’ because musi  cians have no gold for sounding
Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress’ What a pestilent knave is this same
Hang him Jack
Come we'll in here tarry for the mourners and stay dinner
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think
And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips That I reviv'd and was an emperor
Ah me
how sweet is love itself possess'd When but love's shadows are so rich in joy
News from Verona
How now Balthasar
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
How doth my lady
Is my father well
How fares my Juliet
That I ask again For nothing can be ill if she be well
Then she is well and nothing can be ill
Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument And her immortal part with angels lives
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you
O pardon me for bringing these ill news Since you did leave it for my office sir
Is it e'en so
Then I defy you stars
Thou knowest my lodging
Get me ink and paper And hire posthorses
I will hence to night
I do beseech you sir have patience
Your looks are pale and wild and do import Some misadventure
Tush thou art deceiv'd
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar
No my good lord
No matter
Get thee gone And hire those horses
I'll be with thee straight
Well Juliet I will lie with thee to night
Let's see for means
O mischief thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
I do remember an apothecary And hereabouts he dwells which late I noted In tatt'red weeds with overwhelming brows Culling of simples
Meagre were his looks Sharp misery had worn him to the bones And in his needy shop a tortoise hung An alligator stuff'd and other skins Of ill shaped fishes and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses Were thinly scattered to make up a show
Noting this penury to myself I said ‘An if a man did need a poison now Whose sale is present death in Mantua Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him’ O this same thought did but forerun my need And this same needy man must sell it me
As I remember this should be the house
Being holiday the beggar's shop is shut
What ho
apothecary
Who calls so loud
Come hither man
Let me have A dram of poison such soon speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life weary taker may fall dead And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath As violently as hasty powder fir'd Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb
Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness And fearest to die
My poverty but not my will consents
I pay thy poverty and not thy will
Put this in any liquid thing you will And drink it off and if you had the strength Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
Farewell
Buy food and get thyself in flesh
Holy Franciscan friar brother ho
This same should be the voice of Friar John
Welcome from Mantua
What says Romeo
Or if his mind be writ give me his letter
Going to find a barefoot brother out One of our order to associate me Here in this city visiting the sick And finding him the searchers of the town Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign Seal'd up the doors and would not let us forth So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd
Who bare my letter then to Romeo
I could not send it here it is again  Nor get a messenger to bring it thee So fearful were they of infection
Unhappy fortune
By my brotherhood The letter was not nice but full of charge Of dear import and the neglecting it May do much danger
Brother I'll go and bring it thee
She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents But I will write again to Mantua And keep her at my cell till Romeo come  Poor living corse clos'd in a dead man's tomb
Give me thy torch boy
Hence and stand aloof
Whistle then to me As signal that thou hear'st something approach
Give me those flowers
Do as I bid thee go
I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard yet I will adventure
The obsequies that I for thee will keep Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
The boy gives warning something doth approach
What cursed foot wanders this way to night To cross my obsequies and true love's rite
What with a torch
Muffle me night a while
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
Hold take this letter
Early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father
Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady's face But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring a ring that I must use In dear employment
But if thou jealous dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
The time and my intents are savage wild More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea
I will be gone sir and not trouble you
So shalt thou show me friendship
Take thou that
Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
For all this same I'll hide me hereabout
His looks I fear and his intents I doubt
Thou detestable maw thou womb of death Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open And in despite I'll cram thee with more food
This is that banish'd haughty Montague That murdered my love's cousin with which grief It is supposed the fair creature died  And here is come to do some villanous shame To the dead bodies
I will apprehend him
Stop thy unhallowed toil vile Montague
Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death
Condemned villain I do apprehend thee
Obey and go with me for thou must die
I beseech thee youth Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury
O be gone
By heaven I love thee better than myself For I come hither arm'd against myself
Live and hereafter say A madman's mercy bid thee run away
I do defy thy conjuration And apprehend thee for a felon here
Wilt thou provoke me
Then have at thee boy
O Lord they fight
I will go call the watch
O I am slain
If thou be merciful Open the tomb lay me with Juliet
In faith I will
Let me peruse this face
Mercutio's kinsman noble County Paris
What said my man when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet
Said he not so
or did I dream it so
Or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet To think it was so
O give me thy hand One writ with me in sour misfortune's book
O no a lantern slaughtr'd youth For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light
Death lie thou there by a dead man interr'd
How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry
which their keepers call A lightning before death
O how may I Call this a lightning
O my love
my wife
Death that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
Thou art not conquer'd
Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks And death's pale flag is not advanced there
Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
O what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy
Forgive me cousin
Ah dear Juliet Why art thou yet so fair
Shall I believe That unsubstantial Death is amorous And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour
For fear of that I still will stay with thee And never from this palace of dim night Depart again
Here here will I remain With worms that are thy chambermaids
O here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world wearied flesh
Eyes look your last
Arms take your last embrace
and lips O you The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death
Thou desperate pilot now at once run on The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
Here's to my love
Drinks
Thy drugs are quick
Thus with a kiss I die
Saint Francis be my speed
how oft to night Have my old feet stumbled at graves
Who's there
Here's one a friend and one that knows you well
Bliss be upon you
Tell me good my friend What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls
As I discern It burneth in the Capels’ monument
It doth so holy sir and there's my master One that you love
Who is it
Romeo
How long hath he been there
Full half an hour
Go with me to the vault
Stay then I'll go alone
Fear comes upon me
O much I fear some ill unlucky thing
As I did sleep under this yew tree here I dreamt my master and another fought And that my master slew him
Romeo
What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour'd by this place of peace
Romeo
O pale
Who else
What Paris too
And steep'd in blood
Ah what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance
The lady stirs
O comfortable friar
where is my lord
I do remember well where I should be And there I am
Where is my Romeo
I hear some noise
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents
Come come away
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead And Paris too
Come I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
Stay not to question for the watch is coming
Come go good Juliet
I dare no longer stay
Go get thee hence for I will not away
What's here
A cup clos'd in my true love's hand
Poison I see hath been his timeless end
O churl
drunk all and left no friendly drop To help me after
I will kiss thy lips
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them To make me die with a restorative
Thy lips are warm
Lead boy
Which way
Yea noise
Then I'll be brief
O happy dagger
Go some of you whoe'er you find attach
Pitiful sight
here lies the County slain And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead Who here hath lain this two days buried
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry
Here's Romeo's man
We found him in the churchyard
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither
Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard side
A great suspicion
Stay the friar too
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest
What should it be that they so shriek abroad
The people in the street cry ‘Romeo’ Some ‘Juliet’ and some ‘Paris’ and all run With open outcry toward our monument
What fear is this which startles in our ears
Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain And Romeo dead and Juliet dead before Warm and new kill'd
Search seek and know how this foul murder comes
Here is a friar and slaughter'd Romeo's man With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men's tombs
O heavens
O wife look how our daughter bleeds
This dagger hath mista'en for lo his house Is empty on the back of Montague And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom
O me
this sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre
Come Montague for thou art early up To see thy son and heir more early down
Alas my liege my wife is dead to night
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath
What further woe conspires against mine age
Look and thou shalt see
O thou untaught
what manners is in this To press before thy father to a grave
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring their head their true descent And then will I be general of your woes And lead you even to death
Meantime forbear And let mischance be slave to patience
Bring forth the parties of suspicion
I am the greatest able to do least Yet most suspected as the time and place Doth make against me of this direful murder And here I stand both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus'd
Then say at once what thou dost know in this
I will be brief for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale
Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet And she there dead that Romeo's faithful wife
I married them and their stol'n marriage day Was Tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death Banish'd the new made bridegroom from this city For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pin'd
You to remove that siege of grief from her Betroth'd and would have married her perforce To County Paris
Then comes she to me And with wild looks bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage Or in my cell there would she kill herself
Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) A sleeping potion which so took effect As I intended for it wrought on her The form of death
Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrowed grave Being the time the potion's force should cease
But he which bore my letter Friar John Was stay'd by accident and yesternight Return'd my letter back
Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred's vault Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo
But when I came some minute ere the time Of her awaking here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead
We still have known thee for a holy man
Where's Romeo's man
What can he say in this
I brought my master news of Juliet's death And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place to this same monument
This letter he early bid me give his father And threat'ned me with death going in the vault If I departed not and left him there
Give me the letter
I will look on it
Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch
Sirrah what made your master in this place
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave And bid me stand aloof and so I did
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb And by and by my master drew on him And then I ran away to call the watch
Where be these enemies
Capulet Montage See what a scourge is laid upon your hate That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
And I for winking at you discords too Have lost a brace of kinsmen
All are punish'd
O brother Montague give me thy hand
This is my daughter's jointure for no more Can I demand
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie  Poor sacrifices of our enmity
A glooming peace this morning with it brings
The sun for sorrow will not show his head
Good speak to the mariners
Bestir Heigh my hearts
Cheerly cheerly my hearts
Yare yare
Take in the topsail
Tend to the Master's whistle
Blow till thou burst thy wind if room enough
Where's the Master
To the Mariners] Play the men
To the Mariners] Play the I pray now keep below
Where is the Master Boatswain
Do you not hear him
Nay good be patient
When the sea is
Hence
What cares these roarers for the name of the king
Trouble us not
Good yet remember whom thou has aboard
None that I more love than myself
You are a counsellor if you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present we will not hand a rope more use your authority
I have great comfort from this fellow
Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him his complexion is perfect gallows
Stand fast good Fate to his hanging
Make the rope of his destiny our cable for our own doth little advantage
If he be not born to be hanged our case is miserable
Down with the topmast
Yare
Lower lower
A cry within] A plague [A cry within] A plague upon this howling
What do you here
Shall we give o'er and drown
Have you a mind to sink
A pox o’ your throat you bawling blasphemous incharitable dog
Work you then
Hang cur hang you whoreson insolent noise  maker
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art
I'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench
All lost
To prayers to prayers
All lost
What must our mouths be cold
The king and prince at prayers
Let's assist them For our case is theirs
I'm out of patience
He'll be hanged yet Though every drop of water swear against it And gape at wid'st to glut him
Mercy on us’ ‘We split we split’ ‘Farewell my wife and children’ ‘Farewell brother’ ‘We split we split we split’ Let's all sink wi'th’ King
Let's take leave of him
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath brown furze anything
If by your art my dearest father you have Put the wild waters in this roar allay them
The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch But that the sea mounting to th’ welkin's cheek Dashes the fire out
Poor souls the perished
Had I been any god of power I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her
No harm
I have done nothing but in care of thee Of thee my dear one thee my daughter who Art ignorant of what thou art naught knowing Of whence I am nor that I am more better Than Prospero master of a full poor cell And thy no greater father
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts
Tis time I should inform thee farther
Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me So [Lays down his cloak] [Lays down his cloak] Lie there my art Wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
The direful spectacle of the wreck which touched The very virtue of compassion in thee I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul  No not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard'st cry which though saw'st sink
Sit down For thou must now know farther
You have often Begun to tell me what I am but stopped And left me to a bootless inquisition Concluding ‘Stay not yet’ The hour's now come The very minute bids thee ope thine ear Obey and be attentive
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell
I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not Out three years old
Certainly sir I can
By what
Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me
Thou hadst and more Miranda
But how is it That this lives in thy mind
What seest thou else In the dark backward and abyss of time
If thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here How thou cam'st here thou mayst
But that I do not
Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter and thy father Was Duke of Milan and his only heir And princess no worse issued
O the heavens
What foul play had we that we came from thence
Or blessèd was't we did
Both both my girl
By foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence But blessedly holp hither
Please you farther
My brother and thy uncle called Antonio  I pray thee mark me that a brother should Be so perfidious he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state as at that time Through all the signories it was the first And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed In dignity and for the liberal arts Without a parallel those being all my study The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger being transported And rapt in secret studies
Thy false uncle  Dost thou attend me
Sir most heedfully
O good sir I do
I pray thee mark me
I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which but by being so retired O'er prized all popular rate in my false brother Awakened an evil nature and my trust Like a good parent did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was which had indeed no limit A confidence sans bound
He being thus lorded Not only with what my revenue yielded But what my power might else exact like one Who having into truth by telling of it Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie he did believe He was indeed the duke out o'th’ substitution And executing the outward face of royalty With all prerogative hence his ambition growing  Dost thou hear
Your tale sir would cure deafness
To have no screen between this part he played And him he played it for he needs will be Absolute Milan
Me poor man my library Was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable confederates  So dry he was for sway with the King of Naples To give him annual tribute do him homage Subject his coronet to his crown and bend The dukedom yet unbowed alas poor Milan  To most ignoble stooping
O the heavens
Mark his condition and th’event then tell me If this might be a brother
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother Good wombs have borne bad sons
Now the condition
The King of Naples being an enemy To me inveterate hearkens my brother's suit Which was that he in lieu o'th’ premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan With all the honours on my brother whereon A treacherous army levied one midnight Fated to th’ purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan and i'th’ dead of darkness The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self
Alack for pity
I not rememb'ring how I cried out then Will cry it o'er again it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to't
Hear a little further And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now's upon's without the which this story Were most impertinent
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us
Well demanded wench My tale provokes that question
There they hoist us To cry to th’ sea that roared to us to sigh To th’ winds whose pity sighing back again Did us but loving wrong
Alack what trouble Was I then to you
O a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me
Thou didst smile Infused with a fortitude from heaven When I have decked the sea with drops full salt Under my burden groaned which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue
How came we ashore
By Providence divine
Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo Out of his charity who being then appointed Master of this design did give us with Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries Which since have steaded much so of his gentelness Knowing I loved my books he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom
Would I might But ever see that man
Here in this island we arrived and here Have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit Than other princesess’ can that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful
Heavens thank you for't
And now I pray you sir  For still ’tis beating in my mind your reason For raising this sea storm
Know thus far north
By accident most strange bountiful Fortune Now my dear lady hath mine enemies Brought to this shore and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star whose influence If now I court not but omit my fortunes Will ever after droop
I am ready now
Approach my Ariel come
I come To answer thy best pleasure be't to fly To swim to dive into the fire to ride On the curled clouds to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality Hast thou spirit Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee
To every article
My brave spirit
Who was so firm so constant that this coil Would not infect his reason
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel Then all afire with me the King's son Ferdinand With hair up staring then like reeds not hair  Was the first man that leapt cried ’Hell is empty And all the devils are here’ Why that's my spirit
But was not this nigh shore
Close by my master
But are they Ariel safe
Not a hair perished On their sustaining garments not a blemish But fresher than before and as thou bad'st me In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle
The King's son have I landed by himself Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting His arms in this sad knot
Of the King's ship The mariners say how thou hast disposed And all the rest o'th’ fleet
Ariel thy charge Exactly is performed but there's more work
What is the time o'th’ day
Past the mid season
At least two glasses
The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously
Is there more toil
Since thou dost give me pains Let me remember thee what thou hast promised Which is not yet performed me
How now
Moody
What is't thou canst demand
My liberty
Before the time be out
No more
I prithee Remember I have done thee worthy service Told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served Without or grudge or grumblings
Thou did promise To bate me a full year
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee
No
Thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep To run upon the sharp wind of the north To do me business in the veins o'th’ earth When it is baked with frost
I do not sir
Thou liest malignant thing
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop
Hast thou forgot her
No sir
Thou hast
Where was she born
Speak tell me
Sir in Algiers
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been Which thou forget'st
This damned witch Sycorax For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing from Algiers Thou know'st was banished for one thing she did They would not take her life
Is not this true
Ay sir
This blue eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th’ sailors
Then was this island  Save for the son that she did litter here A freckled whelp hag born not honoured with A human shape
Yes Caliban her son
Dull thing I say so he that Caliban Whom now I keep in service
I thank thee master
If thou more murmur'st I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters
Do so and after two days I will discharge thee
That's my noble master
What shall I do
Go take this shape And hither come in't go hence with diligence
Exit Ariel] [Exit Ariel] Awake dear heart awake
Thou hast slept well Awake
The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me
Shake it off
Come on We'll visit Caliban my slave who never Yields us kind answer
Tis a villain sir I do not love to look on
But as ’tis We cannot miss him he does make our fire Fetch in our wood and serves in offices That profit us
There's wood enough within
When
Fine apparition
My lord it shall be done
Thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam come forth
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed With raven's feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both
A south west blow on ye And blister you all o'er
I must eat my dinner
This island's mine by Sycorax my mother Which thou tak'st from me
All the charms Of Sycorax toads beetles bats light on you
For I am all the subjects that you have Which first was mine own king and here you sty me In this hard rock whiles you do keep from me The rest o‘th’ island
Thou most lying slave Whom stripes may move not kindness
I have used thee Filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child
Would't had been done
Thou didst prevent me I had peopled else This isle with Calibans
Abhorrèd slave Which any print of goodness wilt not take Being capable of all ill
Hag seed hence
Fetch us in fuel and be quick thou'rt best To answer other business Shrug'st thou malice
So slave hence
sings] [sings] Come unto these yellow sands And than take hands Curtsied when you have and the kissed  The wild waves whist  Foot it featly here and there And sweet sprites bear The burden
Hark hark
dispersedly] Bow wow
Hark hark
I'th’ air or th’ earth
It sounds no more and sure it waits upon Some god o'th’ island
No it begins again
Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell Ding dong
The ditty does remember my drowned father
This is no mortal business nor no sound That the earth owes I hear it now above me
What is't
A spirit
Lord how it looks about
He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find ’em I might call him A thing divine for nothing natural I ever saw so noble
Aside] It goes on I see [Aside] As my soul prompts it
to Ariel] Spirit fine spirit I II free [to Ariel] Spirit fine spirit I II free thee Within two days for this
No wonder sir But certainly a maid
My language
How
The best
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee
A single thing as I am now that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples
He does hear me And that he does I weep myself am Naples Who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld The King my father wrecked
Alack for mercy
Yes faith and all his lords the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain
Aside] Why speaks my father so urgently
This [Aside] Why speaks my father so urgently
Soft sir
One word more
to Ferdinand] One word more I [to Ferdinand] One word more I charge thee That thou attend me
Thou dost here usurp The name thou ow'st not and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy to win it From me the lord on't
No as I am a man
Follow
No I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power
What I say My foot my tutor
Hang not on my garments
Sir have pity I'll be his surety
Silence
One word more Shall make me chide thee if not hate thee
Hush
To th’ most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels
to Ariel] Thou shalt be free [to Ariel] Thou shalt be free As mountain winds but then exactly do All points of my command
Prithee peace
He receives comfort like cold porridge
The visitor will not give him o'er so
to Alonso] Sir  [to Alonso] Sir  [to Antonio] One tell
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should
to Alonso] Therefore my lord  [to Alonso] Therefore my lord  [to Sebastian] Fie what a spendthrift is he of his [to Sebastian] Fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
to Gonzalo] I prithee spare
The old cock
The cockerel
The wager
A laughter
A match
to Gonzalo] Though this island seem to be [to Gonzalo] Though this island seem to be desert  [to Sebastian] Ha ha ha
So you're paid
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible  [to Antonio] Yet  [to Antonio] Yet  Yet  [to Sebastian] He could not miss't
It must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance
to Sebastian] Temperance was a delicate wench
to Sebastian] Ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered
to Gonzalo] The air breathes upon us here most [to Gonzalo] The air breathes upon us here most sweetly
Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen
to Sebastian] True save means to live
to Sebastian] True Of that there's none or little
to Adrian] How lush and lusty the grass looks
to Adrian] How lush and How green
The ground indeed is tawny
With an eye of green in't
He misses not much
No he doth but mistake the truth totally
to Adrian] But the rarity of it is which is indeed [to Adrian] But the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond credit  [to Antonio] As many vouched rarities are
to Antonio] As many [to Adrian] That our garments being as they were [to Adrian] That our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new dyed than stained with salt water
to Sebastian] If but one of his pockets could speak [to Sebastian] If but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies
Ay or very falsely pocket up his report
to Adrian] Methinks our garments are now as fresh as [to Adrian] Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric at the marriage of the King's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis
Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen
Not since widow Dido's time
Widow
A pox o'that
How came that widow in
Widow Dido
to Gonzalo] ‘Widow Dido’ said you
You make me study of that she was of Carthage not of Tunis
This Tunis sir was Carthage
Carthage
I assure you Carthage
to Sebastian] His word is more than the miraculous [to Sebastian] His word is more than the miraculous harp
He hath raised the wall and houses too
What impossible matter will he make easy next
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands
to Adrian] Ay
to Adrian] [to Sebastian] Why in good time
to Sebastian] Why in good time
to Alonso] Sir we were talking that our garments seem [to Alonso] Sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is not queen
And the rarest that e'er came there
Bate I beseech you widow Dido
O widow Dido
Ay widow Dido
to Alonso] Is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day [to Alonso] Is not sir my I wore it
I mean in a sort
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense
Would I have never Married my daughter there
For coming thence My son is lost and in my rate she too Who is so far from Italy removed I ne'er again shall see her
No no he's gone
to Alonso] Sir you may thank yourself for this [to Alonso] Sir you may thank yourself for this great loss That would not bless our Europe with your daughter But rather lose her to an African Where she at least is banished from your eye Who hath cause to wet the grief on't
Prithee peace
You were kneeled to an importuned otherwise By all of us and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience at Which end o'th’ beam should bow
So is the dear'st o'th’ loss
My lord Sebastian The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in you rub the sore When you should bring the plaster
Very well
And most chirurgeonly
to Alonso] It is foul weather in us all good sir [to Alonso] It is foul weather in us all good sir When you are cloudy
Very foul
to Alonso] Had I plantation of this isle my lord  [to Alonso] Had I [to Sebastian] He'd sow't with nettle seed
to Sebastian] He'd sow't with Or docks or mallows
And were the king on't what would I do
I'th’ commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things for no kind of traffic Would I admit no name of magistrate Letters should not be known riches poverty And use of service none contract succession Bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none No use of metal corn or wine or oil No occupation all men idle all And women too but innocent and pure No sovereignty  [to Antonio] Yet he would be king on't
to Antonio] No marrying ’mong his subjects
None man all idle whores and knaves
to Alonso] I would with such perfection govern sir [to Alonso] I would with such perfection govern sir T'excel the golden age
Save his majesty
Long live Gonzalo
I do well believe your highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing
Twas you we laughed at
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still
What a blow was there given
An it had not fallen flat long
You are gentlemen of brave mettle you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing
We would so and then go a bat fowling [to Gonzalo] Nay good my lord be not angry
to Gonzalo] Nay good my lord be not angry
No I warrant you I will not adventure my discre  tion so weakly
Will you laugh me asleep for I am very heavy
Go sleep and hear us
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts I find They are inclined to do so
We two my lord Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety
Thank you
Wondrous heavy
What a strange drowsiness possesses them
It is the quality o'th’ climate
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink
I find not Myself disposed to sleep
Nor I my spirits are nimble
They fell together all as by consent They dropped as by a thunder stroke
Do you not hear me speak
I do and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep
What is it thou didst say
This is a strange repose to be asleep With eyes wide open standing speaking moving And yet so fast asleep
Noble Sebastian Thou let'st thy fortune sleep die rather wink'st Whiles thou art waking
Thou dost snore distinctly There's meaning in thy snores
Well I am standing water
I'll teach you how to flow
Do so to ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me
O If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it
You more invest it
Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth
Thus sir Although this lord of weak remembrance this Who shall be of as little memory When he is earth'd hath here almost persuaded  For he's a spirit of persuasion only Professes to persuade the king his son's alive ’Tis as impossible that he's undrowned As he that sleeps here swims
I have no hope That he's undrowned
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond But doubt discovery there
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned
He's gone
Then tell me Who's the next heir of Naples
Claribel
How say you
Tis true my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis So is she heir of Naples ’twixt which regions There is some space
There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo I myself could make A chough of as deep chat
O that you bore The mind that I do
what a sleep were this For your advancement
Do you understand me
Methinks I do
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune
For all the rest They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk They'll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour
Thy case dear friend Shall be my precedent as thou got'st Milan I'll come by Naples
Draw thy sword one stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest And I the King shall love thee
Draw together And when I rear my hand do you the like To fall it on Gonzalo
Ariel sings in Gonzalo's ear] [Ariel sings in Gonzalo's ear] While you here do snoring lie Open eyed conspiracy His time doth take
If of life you keep a care Shake off slumber and beware
Now good angels Preserve the King
waking] Why how now
Ho awake
waking] Why how now
to Gonzalo] Wherefore this What's the matter
It struck mine ear most terribly
I heard nothing
Heard you this Gonzalo
Upon mine honour sir I heard a humming And that a strange one too which did awake me
Lead off this ground and let's make further search For my poor son
Heavens keep him from these beasts
For he is sure i'th’ island
Lead away
All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs fens flats on Prosper fall and make him By inch meal disease
A noise of thunder heard] [A noise of thunder heard] His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse
Here comes a spirit of his and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly I'll fall flat
Perchance he will not mind me
A fish he smells like a fish a very ancient and fish like smell a kind of not  of the newest Poor John
A strange fish
When they will not give a dolt to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian
Legged like a man and his fins like arms
Warm o'my troth
I do now let loose my opinion hold it no longer this is no fish but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt
Thunder] [Thunder] Alas the storm is come again
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past
This is a scurvy tune too but here's my comfort
What's the matter
Have we devils here
I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs for it hath been said ‘As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground’ And it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at nostrils
This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got as I tak it an ague
Where the devil should he learn our language
He's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest
Four legs and two voices a most delicate monster
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him I will help his ague
Come
Caliban drinks] Amen
I will pour some in [Caliban drinks] thy other mouth
Stephano
Doth thy other mouth call me
If thou beest Trinculo come forth
He pulls Trinculo out from under Caliban's cloak by the legs] Thou art very Trinculo indeed
How cam'st thou to be the siege of this moon calf
can he vent Trinculos
I took him to be killed with a thunder stroke
But art thou not drowned Stephano
I hope now thou art not drowned
Is the storm overblown
I hid me under the dead moon calf's gaberdine for fear of the storm
And art thou living Stephano
O Stephano two Neapolitans scaped
Prithee do not turn me about my stomach is not constant
to Trinculo] How didst thou ’scape
How cam'st thou hither
Swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither
I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o'erboard by this bottle which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject for the liquor is not earthly
Here kiss the book
Though thou canst swim like a duck thou art made like a goose
Hast thou not dropped from heaven
Out o'th’ moon I do assure thee I was the man i'th’ moon when time was
The man i'th’ moon
I'll show thee every fertile inch o'th’ island And I will kiss thy foot
I prithee be my god
Come on then down and swear
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy headed monster
A most scurvy monster
I could find in my heart to beat him  Come kiss
I'll show thee the best springs I'll pluck thee berries I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve
I'll bear him no more sticks but follow thee Thou wondrous man
A most ridiculous monster to make a wonder of a poor drunkard
I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset I'll bring thee To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee Young sea mews from the rock
Wilt thou go with me
sings drunkenly] Farewell master farewell farewell
No more dams I'll make for fish Nor fetch in firing At requiring Nor scrape trenchering nor wash dish ’Ban ’Ban Cacaliban Has a new master get a new man
Freedom high day
High day freedom
Freedom high day freedom
O brave monster
Lead the way
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious but The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead And makes my labours pleasures
O she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed And he's composed of harshness
I forget But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours Most busil'est when I do it
O most dear mistress The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do
If you'll sit down I'll bear your logs the while
Pray give me that I'll carry it to the pile
It would become me As well as it does you and I should do it With much more ease for my good will is to it And yours it is against
aside] Poor worm thou art infected
You look wearily
No noble mistress ’tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night
I do beseech you  Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers  What is your name
Miranda
O my father I have broke your hest to say so
Admired Miranda
Indeed the top of admiration worth What's dearest to the world
But you O you So perfect and so peerless are created Of every creature's best
But I prattle Something too wildly and my father's precepts I therein do forget
Do you love me
I Beyond all limit of what else i'th’ world Do love prize honour you
weeping] I am a fool [weeping] I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of
aside] Fair encounter [aside] Fair encounter Of two most rare affections
Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between ’em
Wherefore weep you
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer What I desire to give and much less take What I shall die to want
But this is trifling And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows
Hence bashful cunning
And prompt me plain and holy innocence
I am your wife if you will marry me
If not I'll die your maid to be your fellow You may deny me but I'll be your servant Whether you will or no
My mistress dearest And I thus humble ever
My husband then
Ay with a heart as willing As bondage e'er of freedom here's my hand
And mine with my heart in't and now farewell Till half an hour hence
A thousand thousand
I'll to my book For yet ere supper time must I perform Much business appertaining
Servant monster
The folly of this island
They say there's but five upon this isle we are three of them if th'other two be brained like us the state totters
Where should they be set else
He were a brave mon  ster indeed if they were set in his tail My man monster hath drowned his tongue in sack
By this light thou shalt be my lieutenant monster or my standard
Your lieutenant if you list he's no standard
We'll not run Monsieur Monster
Nor go neither but you'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither
Moon calf speak once in thy life if thou beest a good moon calf
How does thy honour
Let me lick thy shoe
I'll not serve him he's not valiant
Why thou debauched fish thou was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to day
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie being but half a fish and half a monster
to Stephano] Lo how he mocks me
Wilt thou let him my lord
Bite him to death I [to Stephano] Lo lo again
Bite him to death I prithee
The poor monster's my subject and he shall not suffer indignity
I thank my noble lord
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee
As I told thee before I am subject to a tyrant a sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island
Thou liest
Trinculo if you trouble him any more in's tale by this hand I will supplant some of your teeth
Why I said nothing
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll server thee
How now shall this be compassed
Canst thou bring me to the party
Thou liest thou canst not
What a pied ninny's this
Trinculo run into no further danger interrupt the monster one word further and by this hand I'll turn my mercy out o'doors and make a stockfish of thee
Why what did I
I did nothing
I'll go farther off
Didst thou not say he lied
Thou liest
Do I so
Take thou that
Beating Trinculo] As you like [Beating Trinculo] As you like this give me the lie another time
Ha ha ha
Beat him enough after a little time I'll beat him too
to Trinculo] Stand farther
Remember First to possess his books for without them He's but a sot as I am nor hath not One spirit to command they all do hate him As rootedly as I
Is it so brave as lass
Dost thou like the plot Trinculo
Excellent
Ay on mine honour
Thou mak'st me merry I am full of pleasure
At thy request monster I will do reason any reason
Come on Trinculo let us sing
Flout ’em and scout ’em And scout ’em and flout ’em Thought is free
That's not the tune
What is this same
This is the tune of our catch played by the picture of Nobody
O forgive me my sins
Art thou afeared
No monster not I
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears and sometime voices That if I then had waked after long sleep Will make me sleep again and then in dreaming The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me that when I waked I cried to dream again
This will prove a brave kingdom to me where I shall have my music for nothing
When Prospero is destroyed
He lays it on
Wilt come
I'll follow Stephano
By your patience I needs must rest me
Old lord I cannot blame thee Who am myself attached with weariness To th’ dulling of my spirits
Sit down and rest
Well let him go
aside to Sebastian] I am right glad that he's so out [aside to Sebastian] I am right glad that he's so out of hope
Do not for one repulse forgo the purpose That you resolved t'effect
aside to Antonio] The next advantage [aside to Antonio] The next advantage Will we take throughly
What harmony is this
My good friends hark
Marvellous sweet music
Give us kind keepers heavens
What were these
A living drollery
Now I will believe That there are unicorns that in Arabia There is one tree the phoenix’ throne one phoenix At this hour reigning there
If in Naples I should report this now would they believe me’ If I should say I saw such islanders
For certes these are people of the island Who though they are of monstrous shape yet note Their manners are more gentle kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many nay almost any
aside] Honest lord [aside] Honest lord Thou hast said well for some of you there present Are worse than devils
aside] Praise in departing
aside] They vanished strangely
Not I
Faith sir you need not fear
When we were boys Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dewlapped like bulls whose throats had hanging at ’em Wallets of flesh
Or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts
Which now we find Each putter out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of
You are three men of sin whom Destiny That hath to instrument this lower world And what is in't the never surfeited sea Hath caused to belch up you and on this island Where man doth not inhabit you ’mongst men Being most unfit to live
I have made you mad And even with suchlike valour men hang and drown Their proper selves
You fools
If you could hurt Your swords are now too massy for your strengths And will not be uplifted
But remember For that's my business to you that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero Exposed unto the sea which hath requit it Him and his innocent child for which foul deed The powers delaying not forgetting have Incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures Against your peace
I'th’ name of something holy sir why stand you In this strange stare
Therefore my son i'th’ ooze is bedded and I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded
But one fiend at a time I'll fight their legions o'er
I'll be thy second
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints follow them swiftly And hinder them from this ecstasy May now provoke them to

What Ariel
My industrious servant Ariel
What would my potent master
Here I am
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform and I must use you In such another trick
Presently
Ay with a twink
Before you can say ‘Come’ and ‘Go’ And breathe twice and cry ‘So so’ Each one tripping on his toe Will be here with mop and mow
Do you love me master
No
Dearly my delicate Ariel
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call
Well I conceive
I warrant you sir The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardour of my liver
Well  Now come my Ariel
Bring a corollary Rather than want a spirit
Appear and pertly
No tongue all eyes
Be silent
Approach rich Ceres her to entertain
A contract of true love to celebrate And some donation freely to estate On the blest lovers
Tell me heavenly bow If Venus or her son as thou dost know Do now attend the queen
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got Her and her blind boy's scandaled company I have forsworn
Of her society Be not afraid
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and miad Whose vows are that no bed right shall be paid Till Hymen's torch be lighted but in vain
High'st queen of state Great Juno comes I know her by her gait
How does my bounteous sister
Go with me To bless this twain that they may Prospus be And honoured in their issue
Honour riches marriage blessing Long continuance and increasing Hourly joys be still upon you
Juno sings her blessings upon you
Earth's increase foison plenty Barns and garners never empty Vines and clust'ring bunches growing Plants and goodly burden bowing Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest
Scarcity and want shall shun you Ceres’ blessing so is on you
Spirits which by mine art I have from their confines call'd to enact My present fancies
Sweet now silence
Your nymphs called naiads of the wandering brooks With your sedged crowns and over harmless looks Leave your crisp channels and on this green land Answer your summons Juno does command
You sunburnt sicklemen of August weary Come hither from the furrow and be merry Make holiday your rye straw hats put on And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing
to the spirits] Well done
no more
These our actors As I foretold you were all spirits and Are melted into air into thin air And like the baseless fabric of this vision The cloud capped towers the gorgeous palaces The solemn temples the great globe itself Yea all which it inherit shall dissolve And like this insubstantial pageant faded Leave not a rack behind
Be not disturbed with my infirmity
We wish your peace
Thy thoughts I cleave to
What's thy pleasure
Spirit We must prepare to meet with Caliban
Say again where didst thou leave these variets
I told you sir they were red hot with drinking So fun of valour that they smote the air For breathing in their faces beat the ground For kissing of their feet yet always bending Towards their project
This was well done my bird
A devil a born devil on whose nature Nurture can never stick on whom my pains Humanely taken all all lost quite lost And as with age his body uglier grows So his mind cankers
I will plague them all Even to roaring
Come hang them on this line
Monster you fairy which you say is a harmless fairy has done little better than played the Jack with us
Monster I do smell all horse piss at which my nose is in great indignation
If I should take a displeasure against you look you  Thou wert but a lost monster
I will fetch off my bottle though I be o'er ears for my labour
Prithee my king be quiet
Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever and I thy Caliban For aye thy foot licker

O peer
O worthy Stephano
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee
Let it alone thou fool it is but trash
putting on a garment] O ho monster
Thy grace shall have it
The dropsy drown this fool
What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage
Let't alone And do the murder first
If he awake From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches Make us strange stuff
I will have none on't
We shall lose our time And all be turned to barnacles or to apes With foreheads villanous low
Go to carry this

Ay and this

Hark they roar
Let them be hunted soundly
How's the day
On the sixth hour at which time my lord You said our work should cease
I did say so When first I raised the tempest
Say my spirit How fares the King and's followers
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge Just as you left them all prisoners sir In the lime grove which weather fends your cell They cannot budge till your release
Dost thou think so spirit
Mine would sir were I human
Go release them Ariel
My charms I'll break their senses I'll restore And they shall be themselves
I'll fetch them sir
Ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him When he comes back you demi puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make Whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew by whose aid Weak masters though ye be I have bedimmed The noontide sun called forth the mutinous winds And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak With his own bolt the strong based promontory Have I made shake and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar graves at my command Have waked their sleepers oped and let ’em forth By my so potent art
Solemn music] [Solemn music] [to Alonso] A solemn air and the best comforter [to Alonso] A solemn To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains Now useless boiled within thy skull

Aside] Their understanding [Aside] Their understanding Begins to swell and the approaching tide Will shortly fill the reasonable shore That now lie foul and muddy
Where the bee sucks there suck I In a cowslip's bell I lie There I couch when owls do cry
Why that's my dainty Ariel
I drink the air before me and return Or ere your pulse twice beat
All torment trouble wonder and amazement Inhabits here
Some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country

He embraces Gonzalo] [He embraces Gonzalo] Whither this be Or be not I'll not swear
The devil speaks in him
No
to Antonio] For you most wicked sir whom to call [to Antonio] For you most wicked sir whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth I do forgive Thy rankest fault all of them and require My dukedom of thee which perforce I know Thou must restore
If thou beest Prospero Give us particulars of thy preservation How thou hast met us here who three hours since Were wrecked upon this shore where I have lost  How sharp the point of this remembrance is  My dear son Ferdinand
I am woe for't sir
Irreparable is the loss and patience Says it is past her cure
I rather think You have not sought her help of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid And rest myself content
You the like loss
As great to me as late and supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you for I Have lost my daughter
A daughter
When did you lose your daughter
In this last tempest
I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth these words Are natural breath
But howsoe'er you have Been jostled from your senses know for certain That I am Prospero and that very Duke Which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely Upon this shore where you were wrecked was landed To be the lord on't
No more yet of this For ‘tis a chronicle of day by day Not a relation for a breakfast nor Befitting this first meeting
Here have I few attendants And subjects none abroad
Pray you look in
My dukedom since you have given me again I will requite you with as good a thing At least bring forth a wonder to content ye As much as me my dukedom
Sweet lord you play me false
No my dear'st love I would not for the world
Yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle And I would call it fair play
If this prove A vision of the island one dear son Shall I twice lose
A most high miracle
Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about
Arise and say how thou cam'st here
O wonder
How many goodly creatures are there here
How beauteous mankind is
O brave new world That has such people in't
Tis new to thee
to Ferdinand] What is this maid with whom thou [to Ferdinand] What is this maid with whom thou wast at play
Sir she is mortal But by immortal providence she's mine
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice nor thought I had one
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan Of whom so often I have heard renown But never saw before of whom I have Received a second life and second father This lady makes him to me
I am hers
But O how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness
I have inly wept Or should have spoke ere this
I say amen Gonzalo
Was Milan thrust from Milan that his issue Should become kings of Naples
O rejoice Beyond a common joy
And set it down With gold on lasting pillars in one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis And Ferdinand her brother found a wife Where he himself was lost Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle and all of ourselves When no man was his own [to Ferdinand and Miranda] Give me your hands
Be it so
Amen
Here is more of us
I prophesied if a gallows were on land This fellow could not drown
to the Boatswain] Now [to the Boatswain] Now blasphemy That swear'st grace o'erboard not an oath on shore
Hast thou no mouth by land
What is the news
The best news is that we have safely found Our King and company the next our ship Which but three glasses since we gave out split Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea
aside to Prospero] Sir all this service [aside to Prospero] Sir all this service Have I done since I went
If I did think sir I were well awake I'd strive to tell you
aside to Ariel] Bravely my diligence
Thou shalt be free
to Alonso] How fares my gracious sir
There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not
Every man shift for all the rest and let no man take care for himself for all is but fortune
Coragio bully  monster coragio
If these be true spies which I wear in my head here's a goodly sight
O Setebos these be brave spirits indeed
How fine my master is
I am afraid He will chastise me
Ha ha
What things are these my lord Antonio
Will money buy ’em
Very like one of them Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable
I shall be pinched to death
Is not this Stephano my drunken butler
I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that I fear me will never out of my bones
I shall not fear fly  blowing
Why how now Stephano
O touch me not
I am not Stephano but a cramp
You'd be king o's the isle sirrah
I should have been a sore one then
pointing to Caliban] This is a strange thing as e'er I [pointing to Caliban] This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on
Ay that I will and I'll be wise hereafter And seek for grace
What a thrice double ass Was I to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool
Go to away
to Stephano and Trinculo] Hence and bestow your lug  [to Stephano and Trinculo] Hence and bestow your lug  gage where you found it
Or stole it rather
I long To hear the story of your life which must Take the ear strangely
I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again
But if Antony is alive healthy friendly with Caesar and not Caesar’s prisoner I’ll shower you with gold and pearls
Madam he’s well
That’s well spoken
And he’s friendly with Caesar
You are an honest man
Caesar and he are better friends than ever
I’m going to make you a rich man
But yet madam  I don’t like the sound of “but yet” It reverses all the good that came before it
Damn those words “but yet” “But yet” is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal
Please my friend give me all the news both good and bad at the same time
You say he’s friendly with Caesar healthy and free
I didn’t say free madam
No I didn’t say that
He’s bound to Octavia
For what favor
For the favor of sleeping in her bed
I’m sick Charmian
He’s married to Octavia madam
May you die of the worst disease
Good madam be patient
What did you say to me
Get out you horrible bastard or I’ll gouge out your eyes
I’ll scalp you
I’ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle making your pain linger
If you say it isn’t true I’ll give you a province and make you rich
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me
He’s married madam
Rogue you’ve lived too long
No way then I’ll run
What’s the matter with you madam
I haven’t done anything to you
Good madam restrain yourself
The man hasn’t done anything wrong
Even innocents cannot always escape disaster
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes
Call that servant back
Even though I’m mad I won’t bite him
Call him
He’s afraid to come in
I won’t hurt him
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress
Come here sir
It may be honest but it’s never wise to bring bad news
You can give good news in many ways but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it
I’ve only done my duty
Is he married
May the gods destroy you
Do you maintain the same story
Do you want me to lie madam
Go get out
Even if you were as handsome as  I beg your highness’ pardon
Is he really married
Please don’t be offended that I don’t want to offend you any more
It’s not fair to punish me for something you make me do
He’s married to Octavia
It’s too bad that Antony’s fault should make you look like a jerk
Go away
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you
Be patient your highness
When I have praised Antony I’ve disparaged Caesar
Many times madam
I’m being repaid for that now
Help me out of here
Oh Iras Charmian
It doesn’t matter
How old is she
Don’t let him leave out the color of her hair
Bring me his answers quickly
Even though half of him is like a
Lord Alexas sweet Alexas most anything Alexas almost the most consummate Alexas where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen
Oh I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife
I don’t make fortunes I only see them
Then see a good one for me
No he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old
May my wrinkles forbid that
Don’t joke about his predictions
Pay attention
Quiet
You will love more than you are loved
It’s proper that we speak first which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar
Take your time
Pompey you cannot frighten us with your navy
We’ll meet you at sea
Yes on land you do outnumber me
Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands
But since  To get back to the matter at hand what do you think of our proposal
That’s the point
Don’t let us talk you into anything but consider carefully the value of our offers
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia
In return I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome
If I agree to this we may leave unharmed with our shields undented
That’s our offer
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer
Let me shake your hand
I didn’t think I would see you here
The East is very seductive
Well I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage
It’s good we had this meeting
I hope it works out for the best Lepidus
So we are in agreement
That’s the next thing on the agenda
We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways
I’ll give the first one Pompey
No Antony
Whether your banquet is first or last your Egyptian cooking will make it the best
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there
You’ve heard a lot
I mean well sir
I’m sure you do
I’ve heard a lot more
I heard that Apollodorus carried    What did he carry please
How are you soldier
I’m well and probably will be for a while as I hear that four feasts are being prepared
Let me shake your hand
I’ve never been your enemy
I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill
Sir I wouldn’t say I was your friend but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave
Enjoy your frankness it suits you
I invite you all aboard my ship
After you my lords
Show us the way sir
Come with me
I think it was at sea
That it was sir
You’ve done well at sea
And you’ve done well on land
I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied
Neither can my accomplishments at sea
Yes for your own safety you should deny one thing you have been a great thief at sea
As you were on land
That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny
But let’s shake hands Menas
If our eyes were policemen they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing
Men’s faces are truthful whatever their hands do
But no beautiful woman has an honest face
That’s no lie
They steal hearts
We came here to fight against you
For my part I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune
If that’s true he won’t get it back by crying
That’s the truth sir
We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here
Is he married to Cleopatra
Caesar’s sister is named Octavia
That’s true sir
She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife
But she is now Mark Antony’s wife
Excuse me sir
It’s true
Then Caesar and he will always be united
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union I wouldn’t say that
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love
I think so too
But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them
Octavia has a pious chaste meek disposition
Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that
Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition meaning Mark Antony
He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish
Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar and as I said before the thing that brought them together will part them
Antony will go where his passion is
He only married out of political necessity
Then that’s the way it may turn out
Come on sir will you come aboard
I want to drink your health
I’ll join you sir
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt
Let’s go
Here’s where they’ll end up on the floor
Some of them are leaning already
Lepidus is red in the face
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor
I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than a sword I cannot lift
This is how they do it sir they measure the depth of the Nile according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty
The higher the Nile flows the better the harvest
The harvest comes shortly after that
Do you have unusual snakes there
Yes Lepidus
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud just like the crocodile
I don’t feel so well but I won’t stop
Not until you pass out
I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then
I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid
Without doubt I’ve heard that
What does a crocodile look like
Sir it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs
Its own color
It’s a strange snake
It is that
And its tears are wet
What is it
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny
You’ve served me faithfully
What else can I say
What are you saying
Would you like to be king of the entire world
Now I’ve said it twice
How could that happen
Just listen to him
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune
Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them
Oh excellent
Then my children will probably be illegitimate
Tell me please how many boys and girls will I have
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one you would have a million children
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish
We’ll all want our fortune told
My fortune like that of many of us tonight is to go drunk to bed
Are you drunk
No Pompey I haven’t had anything to drink
Tell me how
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat
Everything that belongs to them is yours
Oh you should have done it without telling me
For you to do it would be good service
You should know that to me profit isn’t more important than honor but the other way around
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions
But now I must condemn it
Give it up and go drink
This toast is for Lepidus
Here’s to you Menas
I accept with thanks Enobarbus
There goes a strong fellow Menas
Why do you say that
He carries a third of the world
Can’t you see that
Then a third of the world is drunk
Drink up
All right then
This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet
It’s getting there
Clink your cups together in a toast
Here’s to Caesar
I could do without another toast
Live in the moment
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one
Let’s have one good soldier
Come let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful
Everyone join hands
How can you top that
Good night Pompey
Yes we will
Let’s shake on it
We’re friends
Come this way to the rowboat
Be careful not to fall in
Menas I’m not going back on shore
No come to my cabin
What do you say
There’s my hat
Hooray
Come on noble captain
Now I’ve paid you back Parthia and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus’ death
You must understand Silius that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival
I could do more to help Antony but to do so would insult him
A soldier is just a tool like his sword unless he has your qualities Ventidius
Are you going to write Antony about this
I’ll write how under his flag and with his well paid troops we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia
Where’s Antony now
Did the brothers in law leave
They finished their business with Pompey and Pompey has left
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome
Caesar is in a sober mood
He’s a stylish man
And how he loves Caesar
Yes but how he adores Mark Antony
Caesar
Then what’s Antony
A god of a god
Are you talking about Caesar
He’s without equal
Oh Antony
Oh you  If you want to praise Caesar just say his name that’s all the praise that’s necessary
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments
He loves Caesar best but he also loves Antony
Oh
Hearts cannot think it tongues cannot speak it meas urements cannot calculate it scribes cannot write it bards cannot sing it and poets cannot make verses about it
He loves them both
They are his dung and he their beetle
So there’s the signal to ride
Good bye noble Agrippa
Good luck worthy soldier and good bye
You can’t go any further with us sir
If you and I don’t value her equally it would be better for us to work out our differences without her
Don’t insult me with your distrust
I mean what I say
You won’t find any cause for anxiety even if you look for one
So may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support
We’ll leave you here
Good bye my dearest sister good bye
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease
Farewell
My noble brother
Her eyes are like April full of showers
What is it Octavia
I’ll tell you privately
See now I have you
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods
Good bye
Be happy
Farewell farewell
Farewell
Like the  Oh stop it you lusty bed hopper
You can’t see the future
Well if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity then I can’t scratch my own ear
Your fortunes are the same
But how
Give me details
I’ve said what I have to say
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers
Well if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me where would you like the improvement
Not in my husband’s nose
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts
Alexas
If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful
Therefore dear Isis do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves
Where is that messenger
He’s afraid to come in
Oh come on Come here sir
Gracious Queen even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood
I’ll have Herod’s head chopped off
Most formidable Queen
Did you see Octavia
Yes revered Queen
Where
In Rome Madam
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony
Is she as tall as I am
She is not madam
Did you hear her speak
Is her voice pitched high or low
Madam I heard her speak
She has a low pitched voice
That’s not in her favor
He can’t like her very long
Like her
Oh Isis that’s impossible
You’re right Charmian
She creeps along
She has a body not a life
Is this true
If not then I have no powers of observation
There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better
She doesn’t have anything going for her so far
This messenger is wise
Very wise
Do you hear that Charmian
And I think she’s at least thirty
Do you remember her face
Was it long or round
Round enough to be unattractive
Usually that means a person is foolish
What color is her hair
Brown madam and she wouldn’t want her forehead to be any lower
You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me
I’ll hire you again to go back to Rome
My letters are ready to go
He’s an admirable man
He certainly is
I’m very sorry I was so hard on him
Not a bit madam
Everything may still be all right
I assure you it is madam
Oh dear husband don’t believe everything you hear or if you must believe it don’t let it all make you angry
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree
Gentle Octavia support the one that supports you
In the meantime I’ll raise an army that will surpass his
May the god of power make me the weakest of the weak your mediator
When you find out who started this disagreement turn your anger upon them
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions
How goes it friend Eros
Some startling news has just arrived sir
What news man
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey
That’s old news
Who’s winning
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them they’ll battle each other to the death to have it all
Where’s Antony
Another thing Domitius Antony wants to see you now
I should have waited to tell you my news
But never mind
Take me to Antony
Come with me sir
In Alexandria he condemned Rome and that’s not all
This is what happened he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver covered stage in the marketplace
He did this in public
He gave Syria Cilicia and Phoenicia to Ptolemy
Let’s send this news to Rome
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already
The people have heard it already and they’ve been told of his accusations
Who does he accuse
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius’ possessions which we seized in Sicily
Then he says I didn’t return some ships he loaned me
Sir these accusations should be answered
It has been done already and the messenger is on his way
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position
He’ll never agree to that
Then we won’t agree to his demands
Greetings Caesar my lord
Greetings dearest Caesar
Oh to think you’ve been rejected
You’ve never thought of me like that and you have no reason to
Then why did you travel so quietly
You didn’t arrive like Caesar’s sister
Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven
I would have met you by sea and again by land
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him
Which he quickly allowed given that you’re an obstacle to his lust
Amen
Quiet
Here comes Antony
Have you seen my lord
No lady
Wasn’t he here
No madam
He was in a good mood and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome
Madam
Here at your service
Here comes my lord
Your wife Fulvia mustered her army first
Against my brother Lucius
Yes
Don’t say that my lord
Where do you think he is now
He’s in Athens my lord
No he’s not
Cleopatra summoned him
He’s given his empire to a whore and now they’re gathering kings to wage a war
He’s recruited Bocchus the King of Libya Archelaus of Cappadocia Philadelphos King of Paphlagonia the Thracian king Adallas King Manchus of Arabia the King of Pont Herod of Judea Mithridates King of Comagen Polemon and Amyntas the kings of Mede and Lycaonia and many more
I’m divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other
You’re welcome here
I didn’t write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations
Cheer yourself
You will always be welcome to me
Welcome lady
Welcome dear madam
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us
It’s undeniable
You are welcome here sister
I beg you to continue to be patient
My dearest sister
But why why why
You opposed my taking part in the war
Isn’t this war against me
Why shouldn’t I be there in person
What do you mean
Let Rome fall
May the tongues of our critics rot
I have responsibilities in this war and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man
Don’t argue against it
I won’t stay behind
No I’ve had my say
Here comes the Emperor
Isn’t it strange Canidius that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne Have you heard about this sweet
No one admires speed more than the lazy
What else
Why do you want to do that my lord
Because he’s daring us to do it
So you’ve dared him to single combat
Yes and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia where he fought against Pompey
But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage and so should you
His ships are maneuverable
Yours are slow and awkward
Refusing to fight him at sea won’t disgrace you
I’ll fight at sea
Even if we fail at that we can still fight him on land
What’s your business
The news is true my lord
He has captured Toryne
Canidius take our nineteen
What’s the news brave soldier
Oh don’t fight by sea noble Emperor
Don’t trust rotten planks
Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe
Well well let’s go
By Hercules I think I’m right
Soldier you are
Our leader is being led
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together don’t you
Marcus Octavius Marcus Justeius Publicola and Caelius will go by sea but we’ll keep the bulk on land
Caesar’s speed defies belief
While he was still in Rome he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled
Who’s his lieutenant do you know
A man named Taurus they say
I know the man well
The Emperor is calling for Canidius
The present time is like a woman in labor each minute giving birth to some piece of news
Taurus
My lord
Don’t attack by land
Don’t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea
Our fate depends on this chance
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill in sight of Caesar’s navy
I can’t watch any more
The Egyptian flagship the  Gods and goddesses the whole congregation of them
What’s wrong with you
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces
How goes the battle
Right in the middle of the fight just when the battle could have gone either way actually we had a slight advantage that immoral Egyptian nag May she die of leprosy suddenly became frightened and turned her ships around and fled
I saw that
The sight made me so sick I couldn’t watch any more
Well give me the worst news
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward
Go on
As far as I’m concerned what’s past is done
It’s like this as long as a person tells me the truth even though it means my death I will listen as though he praised me
Oh my lord
Speak plainly
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her
It’s easy to err when left to our own devices but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them
Good bye for a while
I never saw such a shameful act
Terrible
Terrible
The battle on the sea is almost lost
If our general had been his old self we would have won
Oh with his sordid desertion he sets the example for our own
Are you considering desertion as well
Then everything must really be finished
They fled toward Peloponnesus
I’ll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar
Listen
Friends come here
I’m completely lost
I have a ship full of treasure
Escape and make peace with Caesar
Flee
Not us
I’ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run
Friends go
I’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance
Leave
Oh I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now
Even my hair revolts
Friends go
I’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you
Please don’t be sad and don’t tell me how reluctant you are
Take your cues from my own despair
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself
Go to the harbor immediately
I’ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure
Just give me a moment please only a moment
I’ve relinquished my authority so please I’ll see you all before long
What else
Let me sit down
Oh damn damn damn
Madam
Madam oh good Empress
The Queen is here my lord
Go to him madam speak to him
He’s not himself because he feels so ashamed
Well then help me
Most noble sir stand up
The Queen is coming
She’s weak and will die unless you comfort her
I’ve destroyed my reputation a most shameful error
Sir here’s the Queen
Oh where have you led me Egypt
Oh my lord my lord forgive my panic
I didn’t think you would follow me
Queen you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods’ orders in favor of yours
Oh forgive me
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man
You knew that my sword weakened by my love for you would obey that love no matter what
Don’t shed even one tear
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost
Give me a kiss
This repays me
Let the envoy from Antony come in
Do you know him
Come forward and speak
Humble as I am I represent Antony
Until recently I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean
So be it
Say what you’re here for
If that is not granted he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens
That’s all he asks for himself
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority
As for Antony I’m not interested in his requests
I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him
Then I’ll listen to her
Give my answer to them both
May good luck follow you
Take him safely through the lines
I go Caesar
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions
I will Caesar
What are we going to do Enobarbus
Think about our situation then die
Who is to blame for this Antony or I
Only Antony was at fault
Why should he have followed you
With half the world opposing the other half it wasn’t the time for Antony the pivotal player to let love distract him
To race after your departing ships leaving his navy to watch was a shame as great as the resulting loss
Please let’s not talk about it
Is that his answer
Yes my lord
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up
That’s what he says
Tell her
Your head my lord
A messenger has arrived from Caesar
With no more ceremony than that
See ladies how they scorn me now
I’ll be at your service
He’s waiting outside
What’s your message
Your wife Fulvia is dead
Where did she die
In Sicyon
In this letter you’ll find details of her illness and other more serious matters that concern you
Leave me
What does Caesar want
It is for your ears only
There are only friends here
Speak confidently
So they are possibly Antony’s friends
Sir he should have as many as Caesar has
If Caesar chose Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend
As for us you know we are Antony’s and he is Caesar’s
Just remember that he is Caesar
He knows that you didn’t embrace Antony because you loved him but because you feared him
Oh
He is like a god and knows the truth
My honor wasn’t given it was only dominated
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection
What’s your name
My name is Thidias
Most kind messenger tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him
Promising favors
By Jove that thunders
Who are you slave
You will be whipped
Take away this lout and whip him
By the moon and stars
Whip him
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand what’s her name now
Whip him fellows until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy
Take him away
Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us
My good lord  You’ve always been a liar
But when our vices become habits Oh the sadness of it the wise gods blind us shade our better judgment make us love our mistakes and laugh as we strut to our ruin
Oh has it come to this
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met you
No you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers not to mention your other more depraved affairs which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip
For I’m sure that although you may know what temperance is you’ve never experienced it firsthand
Why are you doing this
Soundly my lord
Did he cry
Did he beg my pardon
He did ask for mercy
Are you done yet
You my earthly moon are now eclipsed and that alone foretells my ruin
In order to flatter Caesar would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants
Don’t you know me still
Has your heart cooled toward me
Ah dear if that is true let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart and let the first hailstone drop down my throat
As it dissolves so shall my life
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion until one by one all my children and every one of my brave Egyptians are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied covered by gnats and flies
I am satisfied
I will fight him there
Our land forces have bravely stood firm
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail as formidable as the sea itself
Where have you been my bravery
Do you hear what I say lady
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips I’ll be covered in blood
My sword and I will earn our place in history
We still have hope
That’s my brave lord
I’ll fight brutally
But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me
Come let’s have one more extravagant night
Invite all my sad captains
Let’s drink through midnight
It’s my birthday
I had planned to celebrate it quietly but since my lord is once more himself I will be Cleopatra again
We’ll win yet
Do so
I’ll speak to them and then tonight I’ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds
Now he’ll work himself up to a fury
When courage consumes reason it destroys its only weapon
I’ll look for some way to leave his service
He calls me “boy” and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die and in the meantime we’ll laugh at his challenge
Don’t give him time to catch his breath
Anger does not protect the angry well
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the last we fight
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony’s former soldiers enough to capture him
See that it is done and prepare a feast for the soldiers
We have enough supplies for it and they’ve earned it
Poor Antony
What would you like sir
I have to leave right away
That will kill our lovers
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them
If we leave it will feel like nothing less than death to them
I must be gone
If it’s that important then let the women die
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause then they’re worthless
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this she’ll die immediately
I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before and for far less reason
I think there must be something invigorating about death since she dies with such enthusiasm
She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods
He won’t fight with me Domitius
No
Why won’t he
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours it would be like pitting twenty men against one
Tomorrow soldier I’ll fight by sea and land
By the end I will either live or else I’ll restore my honor by shedding my blood
Will you fight well
When I strike I’ll cry “All or nothing” Well put
Come on
Call out my household servants
Tonight let’s have plenty to eat
You have all served me well and kings are your peers
The gods forbid
Well my good fellows wait on me tonight
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants obeying my commands
Look they’re crying
Ha ha ha
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that
Those tears will bring blessings to you
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense my hearty friends
You should know my friends that I have good hopes for tomorrow and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death
Good night brother
Tomorrow is the day
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city
No
What was it
It was probably just a rumor
Good night
Well sir good night
Soldiers watch carefully
You too
This is our station
And if our navy wins tomorrow no doubt our army will do their part
It’s an outstanding army and highly motivated
Quiet
What’s that sound
Listen
There’s music coming out of thin air
From under the earth
It’s a lucky sign isn’t it
No
Quiet I say
What does this mean
Hello there good sirs
Yes
Isn’t it strange
Do you hear that men
Do you
Let’s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops
Good idea
It’s very strange
Get a little sleep
Come on good fellow help me into that armor you’re carrying
If luck deserts us today it’s because we defy it
Come on
No I’ll help too
What’s this part for
Ah leave it alone
You armor my heart
No
No
Really I’ll help
It must go like this
We’ve got it now Do you see this my good fellow
Go and put on your own armor
In a minute sir
Didn’t I buckle this well
Excellently excellently
Hurry Oh love if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft
Good morning to you
Welcome
You look like a person who knows the business of war
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully
Even though it’s early there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor
The weather is fair
Good morning General
Good morning General
That was a fine fanfare boys
Like a young man who wants to amount to something this morning begins early
Farewell lady
Whatever happens to me this is a soldier’s kiss
I’ll leave you without revealing any emotion like a man of steel
Lead the way
He goes forth to war bravely
May the gods bless Antony today
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land
If you had the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you
Who deserted this morning
You don’t know
Someone who was always near you
Sir he’s with Caesar
Sir he left his belongings and treasure
He’s gone
It’s certain
Eros send his treasure to him
Do it now
Don’t keep anything back I insist
Write to him from me I’ll sign it sending greetings and gentle good byes
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master
Oh my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors
Hurry
Fulvia is dead
Pardon me
Fulvia is dead
Fulvia
Dead
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth there would be a reason to grieve
But in this way grief and comfort appear together
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started
The business you began here needs you as well especially the business with Cleopatra which only you can attend to
Enough of this frivolous talk
Give our officers notice of our intentions
I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave
Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return
The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full fledged threats
Agrippa go start the battle
We want Antony taken alive
Make sure everyone knows that
I will Caesar
An era of universal peace is about to start
That way Antony will feel like he’s fighting his own men
Caesar hanged him for this service
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust
I’ve done a bad thing for which I will blame myself so much that I’ll never be happy again
Enobarbus Antony has sent you all your treasure with generous gifts besides
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent
It’s yours
Don’t joke about this Enobarbus
I’m telling you the truth
You’d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return
I’d do it myself but I can’t leave my post
Your Emperor is still a king among gods
I am the worst person alive and I know it the best
Oh Antony you extravagantly generous man how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold
My heart feels like it’s about to explode
If grief doesn’t kill me I’ll find a quicker way to kill myself even though I think grief will do the job just as well
I fight against you Antony
No I’ll go find some ditch to die in
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life
Retreat
We’ve advanced too far
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected
Oh my brave Emperor this is what I call a fight
If we’d fought like this before we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads
You’re bleeding a lot
I had a scar here that looked like a “T” now it’s an “H” They’re retreating
We’ll chase ’em into their latrines
I still have room for six more wounds
They’re retreating sir and our superiority indicates a clear victory
Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits from behind
It’s fair game to mark a coward
I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage
Come on
I’ll limp after you
We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp
One of you run to the Queen with the news
Before sunrise tomorrow we’ll kill anyone who escaped today
You are all    Lord of lords
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world
My songbird we have beaten them to their beds
What do you think girl
Look at this man
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind
He deserves it even if it were covered with jewels like holy
If we aren’t relieved in an hour we have to return to our barracks
Oh listen to me night  Who is this
Stay hidden and listen
Be my witness oh you blessed moon
That’s Enobarbus
Quiet
Keep listening
My heart which dried out with grief will surely break apart into a powder and that will be the end of my disgusting mind
Oh Antony
Let’s speak to him
Let’s listen to him
Good idea
But he’s sleeping
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep
Let’s go to him
Wake up sir wake up
Speak to us
Do you hear us sir
The hand of death has taken him
Let’s carry him to the barracks
He’s an important person
Our hour is up
Come on then
He may recover yet
I will
They’ve switched their operation to the sea today
We didn’t please them on land
We’re ready for both my lord
I wish they’d fight in fire or in the air
But here’s the plan our army will stay with us on the hills by the city
Let’s take up the best positions we can in the valleys
They still haven’t joined the battle
I’ll be able to see better from that pine tree over there
I’ll let you know right away how it’s going
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra’s sails
All is lost
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me
Three time traitor and whore
Tell the army to flee
Order them to escape
Go
Oh sun I will never see another one of your sunrises
Luck and Antony separate here and now
Here we’ll shake hands good bye
Is it all come to this
I’ve been stripped of everything betrayed
Oh that devious Egyptian spirit
Ah you sorceress
Be gone
Why is my lord enraged against his love
Get out of my sight or I’ll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar’s victory
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds
Follow his chariot like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails
She’ll die for it Eros ho
Help me ladies
Go to your tomb
Lock yourself in and send him word that you’re dead
When a great person departs it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body
Say the last word I spoke was “Antony” and please word it pathetically
Go Mardian and let me know how he reacts to my death
Eros can you still see me
Yes noble lord
You’ve seen these illusions
Yes my lord
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water
That’s true my lord
Eros my young friend your captain is now just like that cloud
Here and now I seem like Antony but I can’t keep myself in this form my boy
No don’t cry kind Eros
Oh your contemptible lady
She has disarmed me
Get out insolent eunuch
Silence
She has betrayed me and shall die
A person can only pay with their life once and she has paid in full
What you wanted is yours
Most noble Antony” Then as she was speaking your name a strangled groan split her words
Antony” was divided between her heart and lips
She gave up her life with your name still within her
Is she dead then
Dead
Remove your armor Eros
Off
Take off my armor
Oh chest obey me
Heart for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined
Faster Eros faster
I won’t be a soldier anymore
Battered armor be off
You were worn with honor
I will catch up with you Cleopatra and weep for your forgiveness
Since the light of my life has gone out I’ll stop here
Now any effort ruins what it attempts
Yes even power gets in its own way
End it then and everything is over Eros I’m coming my Queen Eros Wait for me
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor
Eros
What can I do for my lord
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace
Do it
This is that time
You won’t be striking me down but defeating Caesar
Call up your courage
The gods forbid
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows though shot by enemies could not
Eros would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade his arms crossed and tied his head bowed in submission his face red from shame while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him putting the final stamp to his humiliation
I would not
Draw your trustworthy sword which you have used in such service to your country
Oh sir pardon me
When I freed you from slavery didn’t you swear to do this when I asked you
Do it immediately or all your previous services to me were accidental without purpose
Take out your sword and come on
Then turn your noble face away from me that face that the whole world adores
Look
Where is he
I haven’t seen him recently
What should I do that I’m not doing
Always give him his way
Never contradict him
Don’t push him too far
I wish you’d be patient
We come to hate that which controls us
But here comes Antony
I am sick and sullen
I’m sorry to have to say this  Help me away from here dear Charmian
I shall faint
I have drawn my sword
My dear master my captain my sovereign let me say before I strike this fatal blow farewell
You’ve said it friend and farewell to you
Good bye great commander
Should I do it now
Now Eros
Well then there
With this I avoid the grief of Antony’s death
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books
I learned to do this from you
What
I’m not dead
Oh kill me
What’s the trouble
I’ve botched the job friends
Oh finish what I’ve begun
Our guiding light is out
And time itself is ended
Sadness and despair
Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead
Not me
Me neither
None of us
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor
Where’s Antony
There Diomedes there
Is he still alive
Why don’t you answer me man
Is that you Diomedes
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me
Most powerful lord my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you
When did she send you
Just now my lord
Where is she
Locked in her tomb
She had a premonition of what has actually happened
Afraid that your anger would not subside she sent you word she was dead
Too late good Diomedes
Call my guard please
Hey out there
Carry me good friends to where Cleopatra is
It’s the last command I shall ever give you
We’re very sorry sir that you may not live to wear us out with your commands
It’s a very sad day
No my friends don’t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well
If we welcome our punishment we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly
Pick me up
I have often led you now you must carry me my good friends and take my thanks for everything
Oh Charmian I will never leave this tomb
Be calm dear lady
No I won’t
Strange and terrible events are all welcome but I despise comforts
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source
What’s the news
Is he dead
He is close to death but not dead yet
Oh Antony Antony Antony
Help Charmian help Iras help
Be calm
It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself
That’s the way it should be only Antony should conquer Antony
No our general’s infatuation is out of control
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore
Look at them
Take a good look and you’ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester
Look and see
If what you feel is really love tell me how much
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated
I want to measure the extent of your love to see how far it stretches
Then you would have to go beyond heaven beyond earth
I have news from Rome my good lord
I am dying Cleopatra dying
I just beg death to wait awhile until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips
I don’t dare come down forgive me my lord I don’t dare for fear of capture
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize
If knives poison or snakes have edge effect or venom I am safe from that fate
Your wife Octavia with her self effacing eyes and self righteous assumptions won’t get any praise from patronizing me
Help us good friends
Oh quick before I’m gone
Such exercise
My lord is so heavy
If I had the goddess Juno’s power I would make the strong winged messenger Mercury pick you up and seat you beside Jove
And welcome welcome
Die where you have lived in my arms
If my lips had the power to give life I would wear them out like this
What a sad sight
I am dying Cleopatra dying
Give me some wine and let me say a few words
I’ll trust my determination and my hands but none of Caesar’s men
Now I feel my soul leaving
I can’t speak any more
Most noble man will you die
Don’t you care about me
Shall I stay in this dreary world which is no better than a pigsty without you
My lord
Oh the glory of war has faded
The flags have fallen
Young boys and girls are equal to men
There is nothing distinctive nothing remarkable left in the world
Our Queen is dead too
Lady
Madam
Oh madam madam madam
Royal Egypt Empress
Quiet quiet Iras
Now I am no more than a woman ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores
Now all is for nothing
How are you my ladies
Cheer up
How are you Charmian
My gallant girls
Good noble ladies be brave
We’ll bury him and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans and make death proud to take us
Come on you can go
The container of that great soul is now cold
Ah ladies ladies
Let’s go
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death
Tell him to surrender
His position is hopeless
Right away Caesar
What are you doing with a sword
Who do you think you are coming in here armed
My name is Decretus
I served Mark Antony who was the commander most worthy of my services
While he was alive I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies
If not you can kill me
What are you saying
Caesar I’m telling you that Antony is dead
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap
The fractured world in its confusion should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens
This isn’t the death of one man
It’s the death of half the world
Now my dearest Queen  Please stand farther away from me
What’s the matter
I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news
What does your wife say you can come home
I wish she’d never let you come
Don’t let her say I kept you
I have no power over you
You belong to her
The gods know  Oh never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been
I knew from the first it would be this way
Cleopatra  How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves you who were unfaithful to Fulvia
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart
When you begged to stay that was the time for words
You didn’t want to go then
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows
My features are still that beautiful or else you the greatest soldier in the world have become the greatest liar by overpraising them
This is his sword
I pulled it from his wound
Look his noble blood is still on it
Listen sad friends though the gods may rebuke me this news would make kings cry
His faults were equally matched by his virtues
But gods you give us faults so we’ll be human
Caesar is upset
Either I had to ruin you or you would have ruined me
Let me tell you friends 
I’ll tell you at a better time
This man looks like his business is urgent
Let’s hear what he has to say
Tell her to put her mind at rest
She’ll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her
May the gods bless you
Come here Proculeius
Tell her we mean her no disrespect
Go and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind
I will Caesar
Gallus you go with him
Where’s Dolabella
Dolabella
I remember he’s already occupied
He’ll be done in time
Come and see the proof
It’s pathetic to be Caesar
He can’t be Fortune he’s only Fortune’s errand boy
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him
What’s your name
My name is Proculeius
But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust
If your master wants a queen to beg from him you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom
If he will grant me conquered Egypt so that I may give it to my son I will kneel to him with thanks
Be content
You’re in the charge of an honorable man
Don’t be afraid
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune
I’m learning every hour how to be subservient
I’ll tell him all of this dear lady
Be at ease
Your majesty
Oh Cleopatra
Stop brave lady stop
We have not betrayed you
What am I being denied death as well
Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself
Your death would prevent that
Where are you Death
Come here
Come and you can have a queen
Oh control yourself lady
Let Caesar do whatever he wants
You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up in your master’s court and I won’t let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome
I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt and make it my gentle grave
I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me making me disgusting
I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids
You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so
Proculeius Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you
I’ll take the Queen into my custody
So be it Dolabella
Be kind to her
Have you heard of me most noble Empress
I don’t remember
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams
Isn’t that your habit
I don’t know what you mean madam
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony
Oh I wish I could sleep again so I could have another dream like that
When he raised his arm in command the world trembled
There was no end to his generosity
Kings and noblemen served him
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change
Cleopatra  Do you think there ever was or could there ever be a man such as the one I dreamed about
No gentle madam
The gods can hear you lying
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings
Listen to me madam
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable
I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now
Thank you sir
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me
I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew
You need not kneel to me
Please rise Queen
The gods have ordained it to be like this sir
Don’t think I blame you
I’ll leave you now
You may do whatever you want in the world
It’s yours and you may hang us your trophies of war anywhere you like
Here my good lord
What do you mean lady
I wish I were as big and strong as you
Listen to me Queen
There is an emergency I must take care of but my whole heart will remain here with you
My Italy is full of civil war
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome
But my personal motivation and that which should move you most to sanction my departure is that Fulvia is dead
Is it possible Fulvia is dead
She’s dead my Queen
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra
This is the inventory of the money silverware dishes and jewels that are still in my possession
Not even trivial things were left out
Where’s Seleucus
Here madam
This is my treasurer
My lord he will swear on his life that I haven’t kept a thing Tell the truth Seleucus
Madam I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it
What did I keep for myself
Enough to buy everything you have declared
No don’t be ashamed Cleopatra
Look around you Caesar
Oh just see what happens after the pageantry is over
Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild
I’ll give you a good reason to cringe I promise you
I’ll scratch out your eyes even if they could fly
Oh that was unbelievably low
Cleopatra our conquest won’t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed
It’s all still yours
Do whatever you like with it
So cheer up
No dear Queen
Eat and sleep
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend
And so good bye
My master and my lord
Not true
Good bye
But listen Charmian
It’s time to end it good lady
I will madam
Where’s the Queen
Look sir
Dolabella
Make the best use of this information you can
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise
Dolabella I will always be in debt to you
And I your servant
Good bye good Queen
I must go attend Caesar
Farewell and thanks
Now Iras what do you think
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me like Egyptian puppets
Crude slaves with greasy aprons rulers and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see
The gods forbid
No it’s certain Iras
Insolent  Oh the good gods
No that’s the truth
I’ll never see it
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes I’ll scratch them out
Why that’s just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions
Now Charmian
Women dress me like a queen
Go get my best clothes
What’s that noise
There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your Highness
He has brought you figs
Let him come in
What a poor instrument that can do such a noble deed
He brings me freedom
There’s nothing of the weak woman left in me
Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me
This is the man
Leave us
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain
I certainly do have him but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him
People who die of it seldom or never recover
Do you remember anyone who died of it
Many people men and women alike
Indeed she gives a very good testimony of the snake’s power
But if you believe everything they say you won’t be saved by half of what they do
But this is a sure thing the snake’s an odd snake
I hope you are pleased with the snake
Farewell
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature
Yes yes
Farewell
There isn’t any kindness in the snake
Good
Will it eat me
Don’t think I’m so dumb that I don’t know that the devil himself won’t eat a woman
Well you can go now
Farewell
Give me my robe
Put on my crown
I long to be immortal
Quickly quickly good Iras quickly
I think I hear Antony call me
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act
I hear him mock Caesar’s luck which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath
Now let my courage prove my title as wife
So are you done
Come then kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips
Good bye kind Charmian
Iras I won’t see you again for a long time
Do I have the asp’s poison on my lips
Did you fall
If you can leave your body so easily then the touch of death is like a lover’s pinch which hurts but is desired
Do you lie still
If you leave like that you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good bye
Clouds dissolve into rain so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth
Poor poisonous fool be angry and bite
Oh if you could speak I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted
Oh eastern star
Quiet quiet
Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep
The poison is as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle Oh Antony No I’ll take you too
Why should I stay  In this vile world
So good bye
Now Death you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession
Close soft eyes
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again
Your crown is crooked
I’ll straighten it then play  Where’s the Queen
Speak softly
Don’t wake her
Caesar has sent  Too slow a messenger
Oh come quickly
I almost feel you
There’s Dolabella who was sent from Caesar
Call him
What kind of work is this Charmian
Is this well done
It is well done and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings
Ah soldier
What’s going on in here
They’re all dead
Caesar you thought this would happen
You’re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop
Oh unfaithful lover
Stop arguing and listen to my plans
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you
I swear by the sun that when I leave here it will be as your faithful servant
Cut my corset laces Charmian so I can breathe
Hurry
Just as Antony loves
Control yourself my precious Queen and concede that my love is true
That’s what Fulvia told me
I beg you turn away and cry for her
Then say good bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit
Oh sir you are too good at predicting the future
What you were afraid of has happened
How did they die
I don’t see any blood
Who was with them last
A simple country farmer who brought her figs
This was the basket
They were poisoned then
Oh Caesar this Charmian lived until a moment ago
She stood and spoke
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress
She stood trembling then suddenly dropped dead
Oh noble weakness
Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark
There’s a similar mark on her arm
This is an asp’s trail and these fig leaves have slime on them just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb
She shall be buried next to her Antony
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome
Come Dolabella
You’ll make me angry
No more of this
I know you can do better than that but it’ll do for now
I swear by my sword  Swear by your shield too
I’ll leave you lady
Polite sir let me say one thing
Sir you and I must part company no that’s not it
It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart but bear with me
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them
Your honor is the reason you are leaving
May the gods be with you
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed
Let’s go
Come with me
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here you come with me and even though I leave here I stay with you
You’re too forgiving
Even if we said that this behavior suits him though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself
If he’s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits then he’ll be punished with venereal diseases and that’s his business
Here’s more news
Pompey has a strong navy
I should have known it
It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized
Caesar I have news about Menecrates and Menas notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships
They’ve made many raids upon Italy and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them
Antony it’s time to stop your wild hedonism
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand
You drank horses’ urine and water from scum covered puddles that even animals would refuse
It’s too bad
Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly
It’s time that we brought our armies into the field
Pompey is making the most of our absence
Tomorrow Caesar I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war
I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime
Good bye
Good bye my lord
Charmian
Madam
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone
You think about him too much
That’s treason
I hope not Madam
What can I do for your highness
I don’t want to hear you sing
I’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do
It’s a good thing for you that being castrated you can better concentrate on my needs
Do you have desires
Yes dear madam
Indeed
Well not in deed madam since I can’t do anything unchaste
Is he standing or sitting
Or is he walking
Or is he on his horse
Oh how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him
He’s speaking now or perhaps he’s whispering “Where’s my serpent of the Nile” For that’s his pet name for me
I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation   
Are you thinking about me
No listen to it Antony
Perhaps  What my love
Maybe
No most likely
You can’t stay here any longer
Call in the messengers and we’ll find out
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt Antony you’re blushing which means you’re Caesar’s servant
Call the messengers
Queen of Egypt greetings
You are nothing like Mark Antony
But since you come from him you’re saturated with his healing spirit
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony
The last thing he did before sending me off dear Queen was to kiss the last of many such kisses this Indian pearl for you
My ear must pull it out
Good friend” he said “say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster’s treasure to the great Queen of Egypt and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen” Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply
Was he sad or happy
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold he was neither sad nor happy
Just notice
He wasn’t sad because he knows that his disposition affects others
He was somewhere in the middle between them   
Oh heavenly mixture
Whether you are sad or merry the intensity of either suits you like no one else   
Yes madam twenty different messengers
Why did you send so many
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar
Bring ink and paper Charmian
Welcome my good Alexas
Charmian did I ever love Caesar as much as this
Oh that splendid Caesar
May you choke on any other sentiments like that
Say “That splendid Antony” The courageous Caesar
By Isis I’ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony my best man among men
Pardon me but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was
In that case the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good
I’ll do well
The people are on my side and I’m in charge of the sea
My forces are growing and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money
Lepidus flatters both of them as they flatter him but he doesn’t love them and they don’t love him
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation
They have a massive army
Where did you hear this
It’s not true
From Silvius sir
He’s dreaming
I know they’re in Rome together hoping for Antony to return
Lecherous Cleopatra may all the charms of love soften those withered lips
Join your witchcraft with your beauty and let Antony’s lust combine with both
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery
This news is absolutely true Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now
In the time since he left Egypt he could have traveled an even longer distance
His military ability is double that of the other two
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow
I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion
Menas I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones
It will be as the gods see fit
In any case our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible
Let’s go Menas
Good Enobarbus you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly
I will advise him to speak as he usually does
By Jupiter if I were Antony I wouldn’t shave my beard today
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances
But major issues must come before minor ones
Not if the minor ones come up first
Here comes the noble Antony
And there comes Caesar
You’re right
If we were in front of our armies about to fight I would do this
Welcome to Rome
Thank you
Have a seat
After you
No after you
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully when I had no reason to speak of you at all
Caesar what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt
But if you conspired against my position while you were there I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt
How do you mean “conspired”
You can judge for yourself what I mean
Your wife and brother led troops against me claiming to be fighting in your name
They said they were acting for you
You’re mistaken
My brother didn’t use my name to justify his rebellion
He rejected my authority as much as yours
I’ve already sent the proof in my letters
If you want to pick a fight you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment but you’re just making up feeble excuses
Not true not true
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause
As for my wife if only you had such a wife
It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that
But you can’t blame me for her offenses
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria
I was not myself as a result of the wine
The next day I explained all this to him which was as good as begging his pardon
Let’s not fight over this fellow
Meet with the ambassadors
Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people
You will never be able to say the same about me
Go on Caesar
What part of the agreement did I break
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them
You refused me both
I overlooked your request but I did not deny it
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions
Spoken like a gentleman
If it’s okay with you you should not press your grievances any further but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you
Well put Maecenas
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished
You can argue as much as you like when there’s nothing else to do
You are only a soldier
Don’t speak any further
As you please
May I speak Caesar
What is it Agrippa
You have a beautiful half sister Octavia
Great Mark Antony is a widower now
You’d better not make that suggestion Agrippa
If Cleopatra heard you you would be well punished for your audacity
It’s true I’m not married Caesar
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say
With this marriage all the petty jealousies that now seem huge and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves would disappear
Since she would love both of you you two would be joined in that love
What do you say Caesar
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia
I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea
Here’s my hand
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts
I’m happy to say “amen” to that
I didn’t think I would ever fight Pompey
There isn’t much time
Either we go after Pompey or he’ll come after us
Where is he now
Near  How large is his land army
Large and increasing
But his navy rules the sea
That’s what I hear
Come with us Lepidus
Noble Antony even illness couldn’t keep me away
Good Enobarbus
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably
And I see you survived your time in Egypt
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast for only twelve people
Is that true
That was nothing
There were many even more memorable feasts
She’s a remarkable lady if the rumors are to be believed
I’ll tell you
The sails were dyed purple and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love
The oars were made of silver and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music
Pretty Cupid like boys stood on either side of her smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them undoing what they did
How excellent for Antony
When she landed at the port Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead
Royal seductress
Now Antony has to leave her completely
Age won’t wither her and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring
Even her worst faults are charming and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut
Let’s go
Good Enobarbus consider yourself my guest as long as you’re here
I humbly thank you
And I will spend our time apart on my knees praying for you
Good night
Tell me why if you can
But you had better get back to Egypt again
Tell me who shall have the better luck Caesar or me
Caesar
So you’d better not stay with him Antony
Your guardian angel is noble courageous significant and unmatched when Caesar’s not around
But when you are with him your angel is weakened and easily frightened
That’s why there must be space between you
Have a good night
Don’t speak of this again
To none but you only to you
With his natural luck he will beat you even against the odds
Your light dulls when he is near
Leave now
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him
Come here Ventidius
You must go to Parthia
Your authorization is ready
Come with me and I’ll get it for you
Don’t spend any more time here
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations
Sir we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good bye
Good bye then until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear which will suit you both very well
You’re taking a shorter route
My plans take me a roundabout way
You’ll get there two days before me
Good luck sir
Farewell
Play me some music
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers
Musicians come in
Never mind
Let’s play billiards
Play with me Charmian
My arm is sore
I’ll do my best madam
I don’t want to play now
Give me my fishing rod
We’ll go to the river
With my music playing in the background I’ll lure fish
Cram your good news into my ears
Madam madam  Antony’s dead
If you say that you bastard you’ll kill your Queen
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand
Let me say first madam that he is well
Well then here’s more money for you
But you know sirrah we customarily say that the dead are well
If that’s what you mean I’ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words
Good madam let me speak
All right I will
But you don’t look as if you bring good news
If you really are Sir Rowland’s son as you’ve just whispered to me and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face  you are truly welcome here
I am the duke who loved your father
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story Good old man you are as welcome here as your master is
Give him your arm
Give me your hand and explain your situation to me
You haven’t seen him since
Sir sir that can’t be true
If I weren’t a merciful man I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place
But do this find your brother wherever he is
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year or get out off my land
I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter I have never in my life loved my brother
That makes you an even bigger villain Well throw him out and have my officers seize his house and lands
Do this immediately and send him packing
Hang there on this tree you lines of poetry and bear witness to my love
And you  And how are you liking the shepherd’s life Master Touchstone
Well in and of itself it is a good life but given that it’s a shepherd’s life it’s worthless
In the fact that it’s solitary I enjoy it very much but in the sense that it’s private it’s terrible
Now I’m very pleased with it being outdoors but in its not being at the court it is boring
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself shepherd
You’re a natural born philosopher
Were you ever at court shepherd
Honestly no
Then you are damned
I hope not
Explain
Well if you were never at court you were never exposed to good manners if you never witnessed good manners your manners must be wicked wickedness is a sin and committing sins leads to damnation
You are in a perilous state shepherd
Not at all Touchstone
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court
You told me that you don’t salute at the court but kiss hands
Now if courtiers were shepherds that kind of courtesy would be unclean
Give a quick example
Come explain
Why because we’re always handling our ewes and their fleece as you know is greasy
What don’t courtiers' hands sweat
And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat
That’s a poor example
A better example come on
Besides our hands are hard and calloused
Then your lips will feel them more quickly
Come on
You worthless man
You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak
Learn from the wise and comprehend the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge much more disgusting than tar
Fix your example shepherd
Your wit is too courtly for me
I’ll rest now
Good morning sir
Can you tell me whether Rosalind Duke Senior’s daughter has also been banished
Where will the old duke live
You’re going to rest while you’re still damned
God help you foolish man
Pray God does some surgery on you you need to be fixed
That’s another sin arising from your ignorance you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation
Here comes young Mr Ganymede my new mistress’s brother
There is no jewel like Rosalind
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world carrying the name of Rosalind
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind
Don’t think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row excepting meal times and sleeping hours
That awful plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market
Oh stop fool
Let me try If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do
A cat in heat will look for a mate And Rosalind certainly will too
Winter garments need to be filled with something And so does skinny Rosalind
After you harvest you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it and by Rosalind
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along
Why bother with them
Quiet you stupid fool
I found them on a tree
Well the tree bears rotten fruit
All right you’ve had your say but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely
Quiet
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence  I’ll write “Rosalinda” Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain
Nature took Helen’s  Cleopatra’s majesty The best of Atalanta And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty
So by heaven’s decree Rosalind Was composed Of different faces eyes and hearts so that she might have the most prized touches of all
Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave
Were you listening to these verses
Oh yes I heard them all and more too
Some of those lines had more feet than the  That’s not a problem the feet can bear Sure but these feet were
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees
Was it a man
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck
Are you blushing
Please who
It’s difficult to bring two friends together but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes
No who are you talking about
Is it possible
No I’m begging you now tell me who it is
Oh this is wonderful wonderful just wonderful wonderful
Good grief do you think that just because I’m dressed like a man I have a man’s patience
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas
I’m begging you tell me who it is quickly and speak fast
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow necked bottle either too much at once or none at all
I’m begging you take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news
So you want to put a man in your belly
Did God make him
I mean what sort of man is he
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard 
No he has only a little beard
Well eventually God will send him some more hair if he thanks Him
I’ll wait till his beard grows in if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on
It’s Orlando who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant
Damn you for mocking me
Really cousin it’s him
Orlando
Orlando
What did he do when you saw him
What did he say
How did he look
Where did he go
What brings him here
Did he ask about me
Where is he staying
How did he say good bye
And when will you see him again
Answer me in a word
You’d better get me  But does he know that I’m here in the forest and dressed in men’s clothing
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling
But taste my story and relish it by paying attention
I found Orlando under a tree like a dropped acorn
That tree could be called God’s tree since it drops such wonderful fruit
Let me talk good lady
Go on
He lay there stretched out like a wounded knight
Though that must have been a pitiful sight the ground looked beautiful
Cry “whoa” to your tongue please
It’s leaping about like a frisky horse
He was dressed like a hunter
Oh that’s ominous
He has come to kill my heart
I’d like to sing my song solo
You’re making me go off key
Don’t you know that I’m a woman
Whatever I think I have to say
Sweetheart go on
Quiet
Isn’t that him heading this way
That’s him
Thanks for your company but really I would have preferred being alone
Me too but still for the sake of good manners I’ll say thanks for your company
Goodbye
Let’s meet as little as we can
I also hope that we can be better strangers
Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks
Please don’t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly
Your love’s name is Rosalind
Yes that’s it
I don’t like her name
How tall is she
Just as tall as my heart
You’re sure full of smooth answers
Your worst fault is being in love
Well it’s a fault I wouldn’t trade for your best virtue
I’m tired of you
There I’ll see only myself
Which is either a fool or a nothing
I’m not going to waste any more time with you
Goodbye good Mr Love
I’m glad to see you go
Adieu good Mr Depression
Very well
What do you want
You should ask me what time of day it is instead
There’s no clock here in the forest
Then there must be no lovers in the forest either because they’re as good as a clock marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour
Indeed I do sir and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem
I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise
Tomorrow sir I’m fighting for my reputation and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed
Your brother is young and inexperienced and because of my affection for you I’d hate to crush him though I’d have to if he challenged me
I’m telling you all this out of affection for you so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace which will be his own fault not mine
Charles I thank you for your loyalty to me and you’ll see that I’ll reward you
I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind but he’s determined
I tell you Charles he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France overly ambitious jealous of other people’s good qualities and a traitor against me his own blood brother
So use your discretion
I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger
But if I really laid him bare I’d have to weep and hang my head and you would not believe me his behavior is so shocking
Why didn’t you say “the swift steps” of time instead of the “lazy foot”
Wouldn’t that have been just as appropriate
No not at all sir
Time travels at different speeds for different people
I can tell you who time strolls for who it trots for who it gallops for and who it stops cold for
Okay who does it trot for
Who does time amble for
Time ambles for both men
Who does it gallop for
Who does it stand still for
For lawyers on vacation because they sleep their holidays away with no sense of how time moves
Where do you live pretty young man
Were you born here
Just like the rabbit who lives where she is born
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this
Many people have told me so
Actually an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak and he was brought up in the city
Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of
There were no primary ones
Please tell me some of them
No I won’t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick
There’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “Rosalind” on their barks
Well I’m the man you’re speaking of
Please tell me your cure
But you don’t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about
He taught me how to recognize a man in love and you’re not a prisoner of love I’m sure
What did he say the symptoms were
A thin face which you don’t have a sleepless sunken eye which you don’t have an irritable temper which you don’t have a neglected beard which you don’t have but that might not be so telling since you don’t have much beard anyway
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles your hat flying off your head your sleeves unbuttoned your shoes untied and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery
But you’re no such man
You’re so neat and well put together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else
Young boy I wish I could make you believe that I’m in love
Make me believe it
But really are you the one who’s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind
I swear to you by Rosalind’s own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man
Are you really as in love as your poems declare
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her
The only reason they don’t get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it too
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance
Have you ever cured anyone this way before
Yes one and this is how I did it
I don’t want to be cured boy
I could cure you if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me
By my faith in love I will then
Tell me where you live
Come with me I’ll show you and along the way you can tell me where you live
Will you come
Wholeheartedly good young man
No you have to call me Rosalind Sister you’re coming
Come on sweet Audrey
I’ll get your goats Audrey
Do my simple features please you
Your features God help us
What features
Really Audrey I wish you were more poetical
I don’t know what “poetical” means
Is it “chaste in word and action”
Does it mean being truthful
Not really for the truest poetry is often the most artificial
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical
I do in fact
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin if you were a poet I might have some hope you were lying
What you don’t want me to be chaste
Not really unless you were ugly
Well I’m not beautiful so I hope that I can at least be chaste
I’m not a slut I keep myself clean but I thank God I am ugly
Well praise the Lord you’re ugly
Well God bless this marriage
Amen
Well that’s what the wife brings to the marriage
Horns
Well there they are
Only for poor men
No no
The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s
Is the single man lucky then
No
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low lying village a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead
Here comes Sir Oliver
Will you marry us here under this tree or should we follow you to your chapel
Is there anyone to give the bride away
I don’t want to take another man’s second hand goods
No someone has to give her away or the marriage isn’t legal
How are you sir
We’re glad to see you
God bless you for being here
I’m very glad to see you
This is just a trifling matter here sir
No no put your hat back on
Do you want to get married fool
Just as the ox has his yoke the horse its bridle the falcon a tether a man has his desires to keep in check
And being a man of your breeding you’re going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest who can tell you what marriage is all about marry you
Then one of you will warp and pull away and there goes your marriage
Come with me and let me advise you
Come sweet Audrey
We have to be married properly
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession
Don’t talk to me
I’m going to cry
Go ahead if you want but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man
But don’t I have good reason to cry
As good a reason as any
So go ahead and cry
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest
I’m very glad I came to see you
If he shows up tomorrow I’ll give him what’s coming to him
If he can manage to walk after our fight I’ll never wrestle for money again
Farewell my lord
But not for long Charles will take care of everything
But you heard him swear up and down that he was
He’s staying in the forest with your father now
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him
He laughed at that and let me go
He writes brave poems speaks brave words makes brave promises and then breaks them just as bravely
He’s like a cowardly
Who’s coming here
Mistress and master you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with
Yes what about him
Sweet Phoebe do not scorn me
Do not Phoebe
Go ahead and say you don’t love me but not so bitterly
Faint fall down if you don’t then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers
Come on show me the wound that my eyes have caused
But my eyes which I’ve darted at you haven’t even left a mark
Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person
Oh darling Phoebe if you ever fall in love with some fresh face then you’ll know about the invisible wounds that love’s sharp arrows can make
Well until that time don’t come near me
And when that time comes then you can mock me but please don’t pity me because I won’t pity you
But mistress know yourself
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man
Ask this man’s forgiveness love him and accept his offer
So take her shepherd and God bless you
Besides I don’t like you
Come on sister
And don’t be proud
The whole world could look at you and no one would be as blind as he is thinking you’re beautiful
Sweet Phoebe have pity on me
Well I’m sorry for you gentle Silvius
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured
You have my friendship
Isn’t that enough
I want you
Well that’s just greedy
But don’t expect any more than that
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me
Not very well but I’ve met him several times
Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him
But what do I care about words
And yet words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to
He’s awfully proud but his pride suits him
He’ll grow up to be a proper man
He’s not very tall but he’s tall enough for his age
His legs aren’t great but they’re alright
His lips were nice and red a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks one was pure red and the other more pink
What right did he have to scold me like that
He said my eyes and my hair were black and now that I think of it he scorned me
I’m surprised I didn’t bite back
But no matter I’ll get back at him soon enough
I’ll write him a taunting letter and you can deliver it
Will you do that for me Silvius
With all my heart Phoebe
I’ll be bitter toward him and curt
Come with me Silvius
Please pretty young man I’d like to get to know you better
They say you are a melancholy fellow
I am
I like it better than laughing
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful
Well I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet
In that case it’s good to be a post
I don’t have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer
You’re a traveler
Well then you have good reason to be sad
I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands
Not true
And your experience makes you sad
I’d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad and to travel for all that trouble no less
Good day and happiness to you darling Rosalind
My beautiful Rosalind I’m only an hour late
Please Rosalind my sweet cousin be happy
Dear Celia I already look much happier than I feel but you want me to look even happier
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father you shouldn’t try to teach me how to be happy
Well by this I can see that you don’t love me as much as I love you
If  Well I’ll just forget the difficulties of my situation in order to focus on the happiness of yours
I swear I will and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster
So please my sweet Rose my dear Rose be happy
From now on I will cousin and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us
Let me see what do you think about falling in love
You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour
Forgive me darling Rosalind
No if you’re ever late like this again I’ll refuse to see you
I’d rather be wooed by a snail
A snail
Besides he brings his fate with him
What fate is that
Why his cuckold’s horns of course the kind you men are always blaming on your wives
See the snail already has its horns which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity
A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous
And I am your Rosalind
Come on woo me woo me
I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind
I’d kiss you before I spoke
No it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say
When good orators finish talking they spit when lovers do (God help us if they ever do) they kiss
What if she won’t kiss me
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves
Indeed you would be out if I were your mistress if my chastity is worth as much as my wit
Aren’t I your Rosalind
I like to pretend you are because then it’s almost like actually talking to her
No you won’t die yourself but only by proxy
This world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love
Then love me Rosalind
Okay I will on Fridays and Saturdays and the rest
And will you have me
Sure and twenty others just like you
What’s that
Well aren’t you a good man
I hope so
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing Come on sister you can be the priest and marry us Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sister
Please marry us
I do
Okay but when
Right now as fast as she can say the vows
Then you have to say “I take you Rosalind to be my lawfully wedded wife” I take you Rosalind to be my lawfully wedded wife
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me but I’ll take you Orlando to be my husband
So do all thoughts
They have wings
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her
Forever and a day
No Orlando men are like April when they’re wooing a girl young and passionate but like December once they’re married and their passions have cooled
I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain more fond of new things than an ape more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey
I’ll cry at nothing and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood
And when you want to go to sleep I’ll be up laughing like a hyena
But will my Rosalind do this too
But she is wise
Right
The wiser the woman the wilder
If you close the doors on a woman’s wit it’ll fly out the window
If you shut the windows it will pour out the keyhole
If you stop up the keyhole it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke
A man with a wife like that might ask “Hey wandering wit where are you off to” Nah better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed
You’ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue
A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman
Rosalind I have to leave you for two hours
I must join the duke for lunch
I’ll be back here with you by two o'clock
Oh go leave me
I knew you’d turn out this way
My friends told me as much and I knew it too
So take me death
You’ll be back at two o'clock
Yes sweet Rosalind
So beware of my contempt and keep your promise
I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind
So goodbye
Well time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal
Goodbye
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours
We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly
Oh cousin cousin cousin my sweet little cousin I wish you knew how deep in love I am
Or it’s bottomless at least pour affection in one end and it runs out the other
Cupid that blind bastard son of Venus conceived from a thought and anger born from insanity that blind naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself let Cupid judge how deep my love runs
I’m telling you Aliena I can’t stand being apart from Orlando
I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns
And I’m going to sleep
Which one of you killed the deer
Yes sir
Then sing it
It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough
What do you say now
Isn’t it past two o'clock
And I see a lot of Orlando here
Look who’s coming
No I swear I don’t even know what’s in it
Phoebe wrote it
Well then what should we do for fun instead
Let’s go find that hussy Fortune and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally
Oh really
Well when Nature makes a person beautiful can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire thereby making her ugly after all
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us
Come on you’re a fool and driven to extreme measures by love
The point is that she didn’t write this letter
These are a man’s words and his handwriting
I’m telling you it’s hers
Why she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian
No a woman’s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings
Do you want to hear what she says
If you want to read it as I haven’t heard it yet though I’ve heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty
She’s Phoebe ing me
Listen to what the tyrant says
You call that ranting
You call this sneering
Why do you pity him
Follow them straight to the cottage
Since you asked I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are
Orlando sends his regards to you both and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind” Is that you
It is
It’s about who I am and how why and where this handkerchief was stained
Please tell us
He looked to the side and pay attention to what he saw then under an oak tree whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle he saw a wretched beggar with overgrown hair and beard asleep on his back
He discovered that the man was his older brother
Oh I’ve heard him talk about that brother and he described him as the most inhumane man alive
He turned away twice and almost left him there
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved
Are you his brother
Was it you that he rescued
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him
That was me but it’s not me  I’m not ashamed to tell you what I once was since I’m so happy to have since converted
But what about the bloody handkerchief
I’ll get there
After a brief time as he is a strong brave man 
Many people faint when they see blood
There’s more to it than that Ganymede
Look he’s recovering
I want to go home
We’ll take you there
Please will you take his arm
Buck up boy
You’re a man
You don’t have a man’s courage
It’s true I confess
Oh sir someone would think I was a good fake
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on
Whoo hoo
That was no show
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint
Fake I’m telling you
Well then be brave and pretend to be a man
That’s what I’m doing
But honestly I should have been a woman
Come on you keep getting paler
I’ll do that because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him Rosalind
I’ll think of something
But please tell him how well I faked a faint
Will you come with us
We’ll get married at some point Audrey
Be patient
Really the priest was good enough no matter what that old guy said
No he was wicked and vile
But Audrey there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl
Here comes the man himself
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin
How old are you friend
Twenty five sir
A mature age
Is your name William
Yes it’s William sir
A good name
Were you born here in the forest
Yes sir thank God
Thank God” that’s a good answer
Are you rich
Well so so
So so” is good very good an excellent answer
And then again it’s not so good but only so so
Are you wise
Yes sir I’m fairly witty
Well that’s a fine answer
Give me your hand
Are you educated
No sir
Then learn this from me if you have something you have it
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass the cup becomes empty
Why the he that will marry this woman
Or rather I’ll kill you or I’ll do away with you or I’ll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity
I’ll poison you or beat you with a club or stab you with a sword
I’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness
I will in other words kill you in three hundred and fifty ways
Therefore tremble with fear and leave
Do what he says William
Farewell sir
Our master and mistress are looking for you
Let’s go
Hurry up Audrey hurry I’m coming I’m coming
Mistress you have to go see your father
Did they make you the messenger
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good and that the mustard on top of them he swore on his honor was bad
Now I’ll swear to the opposite that the pancakes were rotten and the mustard was fine but even so the knight wasn’t lying
And how out of your great heap of knowledge will you manage to prove that
Yes please unleash your wisdom
Watch me stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave
By our beards (if we had them) you are a knave
And I swear by my wickedness (if I had any) that I am a knave
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her
It will be to your advantage because I’ll leave our father’s house and all his property to you while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest
You have my consent
You can be married tomorrow if you want
I’ll invite the duke and all of his followers
Go get Aliena ready because look here comes my Rosalind
And hello to you fair sister
Oh darling Orlando it’s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling
Actually it’s my arm
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws
They’re in the heat of passion they simply have to be together
You couldn’t beat the two of them apart
They’ll be married tomorrow and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony
But oh it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man’s eyes
Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved in having what he wished for
Well then can’t I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow
I can’t live by pretending anymore
I won’t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat
You should know that I think you’re a smart man
Believe me then that I have special powers
Since I was three years old I’ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician no black magic here
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena
I know where she is and if you don’t mind I will set her before you tomorrow whole and unharmed
Are you serious
I swear on my life which I take pretty seriously even if I am a magician
Look here comes someone who loves me along with someone who loves her
I don’t care
A faithful shepherd worships you
Silvius tell this youth what it means to be in love
It means being full of sighs and tears like I am for Phoebe
And like I am for Ganymede
And like I am for Rosalind
And like I am for no woman
It means being faithful and ready to serve just like I am for Phoebe
And like I am for Ganymede
And like I am for Rosalind
And like I am for no woman
It means being filled with fantasy with passion and wishes with adoration loyalty and devotion
And I for Rosalind
And I for no woman
Since you know all this is true why do you blame me for loving you
And why do you blame me for loving you
And why do you blame me for loving you
Who are you talking to
I’m saying it to the girl who isn’t here and doesn’t hear me
All right stop this
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon
As long as I’m alive I’ll be here
Me too
Me too
Tomorrow is the happy day Audrey
We’ll be married tomorrow
I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman
Here come two of Duke Senior’s pages
Good afternoon good gentleman
It really is good to see you
Come sit sit and sing me a song
Sounds good to us
Sit between us
Should we just get down to it
Yes yes and let’s sing in unison like two gypsies riding on a single horse
Really young men though it wasn’t a very hard song to get right the music was still all out of tune
Orlando do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised
Yes even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her
I will even if I were king of all kingdoms
Yes even if I die an hour later
But if you decide not to marry me you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead
That’s the deal
Even if marrying her meant I died
I’ve promised to make everything right
Phoebe keep your promise to marry me and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me
Silvius keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me
I’ll leave now to set all these things right
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter
My lord when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother
But my lord this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic
My lord welcome this man
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest
He swears he used to be a courtier
If anyone doubts this let him put me on trial
I have bankrupted three tailors
I have quarreled four times and almost got in a fight
And how was that one settled
Well we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause
What do you mean the seventh cause
I like him very well
Tell me who is this knight
A man old Frederick your father loves
If he has my father’s love then that’s enough honor for me
Enough of this
No more talk about my father you’ll be whipped for slander one of these days
It’s a pity that fools aren’t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do
Honestly you’re speaking the truth ever since the fools were  With his mouth full of news
Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young
Then we’ll be stuffed with news
Well that’s good
If we’re  Hello Monsieur Le Beau
What’s the news
Fair princess you’ve missed some good sport
Sport
Of what
God bless you sir
This poor virgin isn’t much to look at sir but she’s mine
Really he’s very witty and full of wise sayings
But back to that argument you mentioned
What’s the “seventh cause”
I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard
He sent me word that whether I liked it or not he liked it fine
They call this “the argumentative countercheck” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie” And how many times did you say his beard wasn’t cut well
He’s as smart as they come but just a jester
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite
Good duke come receive your daughter
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes brought her here
If my eyes don’t deceive me you are my daughter
If my eyes don’t deceive me you are my Rosalind
If my eyes aren’t deceiving me goodbye love
Quiet
My niece you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter
Let me have your attention for a moment
I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son and I bring you news
When Duke Frederick heard that great worthy men were coming to this forest every day he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother
I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk
Yes he has
I will go find him
There is much to be learned from these converts
Stay Jaques stay here for a bit
No this fun is not for me
I’ll wait for you in your cave where you can tell me what you need from me
Let’s proceed
We’ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end with delight
If it’s true that you don’t need
What color madam
I don’t understand how should I answer that
However your wit and luck allow
Tell us about this wrestling
Well we’ve missed the beginning it’s dead and buried
There comes an old man with his three sons  It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale
Three proper young men all good looking and with great presence 
Right and they wore proclamations around their necks saying “Be it known to all men by these  The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles the duke’s wrestler
Charles did the same to the second brother and the third
They’re lying over there and the poor old man their father weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving
Oh dear
But tell me monsieur what sport are the ladies missing
Why the one I just told you about
Me too I swear
Doesn’t anyone else want to see this and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs
Shall we go watch this wrestling cousin
Yes I see them coming
Let’s stay and watch
Come on
Since the youth won’t be reasoned with he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness
Is that the man
That’s him madam
Alas he is too young
Yet he seems capable
What’s up daughter and niece
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling
Yes my lord if you give us permission
You won’t enjoy it much I can tell you the odds are so against this young man
Because he’s so young I’ve tried to discourage him but he won’t listen
Call him over here good Monsieur Le Beau
I remember Adam that’s  Here comes my master your brother
Go hide Adam and you’ll hear how he abuses me
Mister Challenger the princess wants to speak to you
I’ll wait on them with all respect and duty
Young man have you challenged Charles the Wrestler
No lovely princess
He is the general challenger
I have only come in like the others have to try to fight him with the strength of my youth
Young gentleman you are too bold for your age
You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength
If you took a good look at yourself or if you thought about this more carefully your fear would teach you to act more cautiously
We beg you for your own sake to respect your safety and give up
Please young sir
If I’m killed it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead
I won’t wrong any of my friends because I don’t have any to mourn for me and I won’t have wronged the world because I don’t have anything in the world
In this world I’m only taking up space
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have
Mine too to join hers
Good luck
I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances
I hope you get what you desire
You get only one round
No I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first
You should mock me    I wish I were invisible so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg
Oh what an excellent young man
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes I can tell you who’d be on the ground
No more no more
How are you doing Charles
He can’t speak my lord
Carry him away
What is your name young man
Orlando my lord the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys
I wish you were someone else’s son
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man but he was always my enemy
I wish you had told me you had a different father
If I were my father cousin would I do this
I’m proud to be Sir Rowland’s son his youngest son and I would never change that not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion
If I had known this young man was his son I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight
Gentle cousin let’s go thank him and encourage him
Yes
Good luck fair gentleman
He’s calling us back
My  Will you come on cousin
I’m coming
Farewell
What is this passion that ties up my tongue
I can’t speak to her even though she asked me to
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you
Good sir as a friend I advise you to leave this place
Although you deserve praise applause and love right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done
The duke is temperamental
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake
Goodbye sir
Later in a better world than this I’d love to get to know you
I’m indebted to you
Goodbye
Out of the frying pan and into the fire from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother
But oh heavenly Rosalind
What’s going on Rosalind
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog
No your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs
Throw some of your words at me
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any
Is all of this about your father
No some of it is about my child’s father
If we walk on the well worn paths they won’t get caught in our petticoats
Cough them up
I’d try it if I could cry “hem” and have him
Come on take control of your feelings
But they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself
Oh that’s a good wish
You’ll fight with him eventually and  The duke my father loved his father very much
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son
By that kind of logic I should hate Orlando since my father hates his father
But I don’t hate Orlando
No please don’t hate him for my sake
Why shouldn’t I
Doesn’t he deserve it
Let me love him because he deserves it and you can love him because I do
Look here comes the duke
He looks angry
Madam hurry as fast as you can get out of my court
Me uncle
You niece
In ten days time if you’re found within twenty miles of the court you’ll die for it
Please your Grace tell me what crime I have committed
If I know my own thoughts and desires and I’m not dreaming or crazy which I’m sure I’m not then dear uncle I’ve never had so much as a half formed thought that would have offended you
All traitors protest like this
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent they’d all be as innocent as God Himself
I don’t trust you
You are your father’s daughter
That’s enough
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom
I was his daughter when you banished him
My father wasn’t a traitor
So please my lord don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor with no titles to my name
Dear master listen to me
Yes Celia we kept her here for your sake
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value but now I know her
If she’s a traitor why then so am I
You’re a fool
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she’s out of the picture
So be quiet
The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable
She is banished
Then lay that sentence on me too my lord
I cannot live without her
You are a fool You niece prepare to leave
On my honor and by my word if you outstay the ten days you will die
Oh my poor Rosalind where will you go
Do you want to exchange fathers
I’ll give you mine
I insist don’t be more distressed than I am
I have more reason to be distressed
Hey you
What are you  Nothing
I’ve never been taught how to make anything
Well then what are you messing up
I’m helping  Indeed sir find something better to do and get lost for a while
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them
When did I  Do you know where you are sir
Yes sir very well I’m here in your orchard
Do you know whom you’re talking to
Yes better than you know me
I know you’re my oldest brother and deserve more respect
I have as much of our father in me as you do though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older
No you haven’t cousin
Please be cheerful
Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me his daughter
No he hasn’t
Oh he hasn’t
Well then you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one
Will we be separated
Should we part sweet girl
I swear by the heavens which have grown pale in sympathy with us I’m going with you whatever you say
But where will we go
To the Forest of Arden to find your father
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in two young innocent women traveling so far
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money
I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt
Wouldn’t it be better since I’m unusually tall for a woman to dress myself like a man
I’ll wear a big sword in my belt carry a boar spear in my hand and hide all my womanish fear in my heart
What should I call you when you’re a man
I’ll take no lesser name than that of  Something that refers to my current state
Instead of Celia call me Aliena
Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels
Let’s go gather our jewels and money
We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone
Now we go contentedly to freedom not banishment
Now my companions and brothers in exile hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance
Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court with all its jealousies and intrigues
I smile and think “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of” Adversity can have its benefits like the ugly poisonous  I wouldn’t change my situation for anything
You’re lucky my lord to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you
Come shall we hunt some deer for dinner
It bothers me though that these poor spotted innocents who after all are this deserted city’s native citizens should be gouged with arrows
Indeed my lord the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths
Big round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose
And did you leave him like this
We did my lord weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer
Take me to him
I love to argue with him when he’s having one of these fits because then he always has a lot to say
I’ll bring you to him right away
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave
It cannot be
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen
I can’t find anyone who saw her leave
Her ladies in waiting saw her go to bed and early this morning the bed was empty
My lord that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing
Send a message to his brother
Bring that swinger Orlando here
If he’s not around bring his brother Oliver to me
I’ll make Oliver find him
Do this immediately and don’t stop searching and interrogating until you’ve brought home these foolish runaways
Who’s there
What are you doing here
Why are you so strong and good
Why do people love you
And why are you noble strong and brave
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion
Your praise has beaten you home
Don’t you know master that some men’s best qualities do them in
Oh what a world this is when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him
Why what’s the matter
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you
Oliver your brother no not your brother and yet he’s the son but no I won’t call him the son of that great man I was about to call his father has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down with you in it
And if he fails at that he will find other ways to kill you
I overheard him and his plans
This is no place for you this home is now a slaughterhouse
Hate it fear it do not come inside
Then where would you have me go Adam
It doesn’t matter where so long as it’s not here
What would you have me beg for my food
This is all that’s left for me to do but I won’t do it
I’d rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers
But don’t do that
Let me be your servant
I know I may be old but I’m strong and healthy because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly
Therefore my old age is like a blustery winter cold but kindly
Let me go with you
I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you
Oh good old man you’re a great example of that old work ethic where people worked because it was their duty not just for the money
Come along though
We’ll go together and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth we’ll find a way to make a living
Go on master and I will follow you with truth and loyalty to my last breath
From the time I was seventeen over sixty years ago I have lived in this house but now I will live here no more
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen at eighty it’s a bit late
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well without owing my master anything
Oh Lord my spirits are tired
I wouldn’t care about my spirits if my legs weren’t tired
I can’t go any further
I’d rather bear with you than  Well this is the Forest of Arden
Yes now I’m in Arden and that makes me the bigger fool
Yes be content good Touchstone
Look who’s coming a young man and an old man having a serious talk
What you dare put your hands on me villain
I’m no villain
If you weren’t my brother I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this
You’ve only insulted yourself
Gentlemen calm down
For the sake of your father’s memory make peace
Let me go I say
I won’t until I’m ready
You will listen to me
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education
But you’ve raised me as a peasant hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman
My father’s spirit is growing in me and I won’t take this any longer
And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money
Well sir go inside
I’m not going to be bothered by you for long
You’ll get some of what you want
Now please leave me alone
What you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually
Oh Corin I wish you could understand how much I love her
I’m sure I can guess
No Corin since you’re old you cannot guess even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was sighing and mooning all night long
If your love was anything like mine and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to
Oh a thousand of them all of which I’ve forgotten
Oh then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me
If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do you haven’t loved
Or if you haven’t sat as I do now boring your listener with all your lover’s virtues then you haven’t loved
Or if you haven’t broken away from human company as my feelings now lead me to do you haven’t loved
O Phoebe Phoebe Phoebe
Oh poor shepherd
Me too
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword on a stone and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty chapped hands had milked
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things
But everything that lives is mortal including the foolishness of love
You speak more wisely than you know
Nah I’ll never be aware of my own wit until I break my shins on it
By God
And like mine but I’m getting a little tired of it
Please one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him
Shut up fool
He’s not your relative
Who’s calling
Your superiors
Please sir if love or money can buy anything in this empty place tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves
Dear sir I pity the lady and wish more for her sake than my own that I was more able to help her
But I’m a hired hand I don’t profit from the flocks I tend
Besides his cottage his flocks and his grazing rights are on sale now and since he’s not there there’s nothing to eat at our house
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture
That young man who was just here
Please if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man buy the cottage pasture and flock for us and we’ll pay you for it
And we will raise your wages
The thing is definitely going to be sold
Come with me
If you like what you see of the land the profit that’s possible and this rustic life I’ll be your faithful servant and buy the place with your gold right away
More more please more
It’s only going to make you sad Monsieur Jaques
I’m glad about that
More please more
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs
More please more
My voice is ragged
I know I won’t please you
Come on another stanza is that what you call 'em “stanzas”
Nah I don’t care what their
Well then if I’ve ever thanked a man I’ll thank you now
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together
The duke will drink under this tree He’s been looking for you all day you know
And I’ve been avoiding him all day
He’s too argumentative for me
I think of as many things as he does but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it
Come warble for me
I wrote a verse to this tune though it’s not very imaginative
Dear master I can’t go any farther
Oh I’m dying of hunger
I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave
Farewell kind master
Hey what’s this Adam
No braver than this
Live a little be comforted a little cheer up a little
If I can find any animal in this wild forest I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you
You’re not as close to death as you think you are
I’ll be back soon and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat I will give you permission to die
But if you die before I return you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts
There we go
You look happier already and I’ll be back quickly
But you’re lying out in the cold
Cheer up good Adam
I think he must have turned into an animal because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man
My lord he just left here
He was happy here listening to a song
If that man who’s made up of conflicts becomes musical then there must be something wrong with the universe
Go find him
Tell him I want to speak with him
He saved me the trouble here he comes
Well what’s going on mister
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company
What you look amused
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and looking at it solemnly said “It’s ten o'clock
This way we can see how the world moves
Only an hour ago it was nine and in another hour it will be eleven
Oh noble fool
A worthy fool
Motley is the only thing to wear
Who is this fool
A worthy fool
God bless my old master
He would never have spoken to me like this
Is that how it’s going to be
Are you starting to challenge me
I’ll cure you of your insolence and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns either Hey Dennis
Did you call for me your Worship
Wasn’t Charles the duke’s wrestler here to speak with me
Yes sir he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you
Call him in
I have a good plan
Like the wind I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please as fools do
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest
Why sir must he
Well it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church
Dress me up in motley
Let me speak my mind and I’ll rid the world of its sickness if it will only tolerate my medicine
To hell with you
I know what you’d do
What would I do besides good
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning because you yourself have been a terrible sinner as carnal in your appetites as lust itself and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her
And when some lowlife protests that  Stop and eat no more
But I haven’t eaten anything yet
And you won’t until the needy eat
What kind of fighting cock is this
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners
You were right the first time
But stop I say
If you won’t listen to reason I’ll have to die
What would you like
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does
I’m dying for food so let me have some
Sit down and eat and welcome to our table
Do you really speak like such a gentleman
I beg your pardon
I thought everything out here was wild which is why I acted so stern and commanding
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men’s feasts and cried tears of pity therefore sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs
Then please put off your eating for a little while I like a mother doe find my fawn and bring it food
There is a poor old man who purely out of love has limped after me for miles
Thank you and God bless you for your hospitality
You see we’re not alone in our unhappiness
The whole world is a stage and all the men and women merely actors
They have their exits and their entrances and in his lifetime a man will play many parts his life separated into seven acts
In the first act he is an infant whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms
Then he’s the whining schoolboy with a book bag and a bright young face creeping like a snail unwillingly to school
He’s full of wise sayings and up to the minute anecdotes that’s the way he plays his part
Welcome
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat
I thank you very much on his behalf
Welcome
Eat
I won’t trouble you yet with questions about your situation Some music please and good friend sing
Time’s not the one in debt
Your logic is so foolish
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend and every one of them knows my name
Some of them give me money some invite me places some thank me for the kind things I’ve done for them some try to sell me things
Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements
These are tricks of the imagination and this place is filled with magicians
Here’s the money you wanted master
Who’s this Adam you speak of
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden but the Adam from the jailhouse
I don’t know what you’re talking about
No
You mean an officer
Yes the leader of the team the one that gets you if you can’t pay a debt the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them “Have arrest” Well sir stop your joking there
Are any ships leaving tonight
Can we go
Why sir I told you an hour ago that the good ship  This fellow’s gone mad and so have I We’re in some kind of dream world
Please somebody get us out of here
Good to see you Master Antipholus
I see you’ve met with the jeweler
Is that chain you’re wearing the one you promised to give to me
Get away from me Satan
Don’t try to tempt me
Master is this Satan’s mistress
She’s the devil
No she’s worse she’s the devil’s mother and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench
But fire also gives off light and fire will burn you
You and your servant are very funny sir
Will you come with me
Can we finish our lunch
Master if you eat with her bring really long silverware
Why Dromio
Some  Now listen either give me my ring or give me the necklace
I hope you’re not trying to cheat me
Come Dromio let’s go
Mistress you know about that
Antipholus has gone insane no question about it
He has a ring of mine worth forty ducats and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it
Now he won’t give me either
The reason I think he’s insane besides the way he just acted is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having
I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring
It’s my best option I can’t afford to lose forty ducats
I’ve spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia
However I’ll do what I can for you
I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus
I will
Don’t worry man I won’t try to escape
I tell you this will make her angry when she hears about it
Here’s my servant
I think he’s got the money
Hello there sir
Do you have what I told you to get
Yes
But where’s the money
Why sir I spent it on this rope
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price
Why did I just send you home
And here I am with that piece
And I’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with
Good sir calm down
Hold your tongue
No you should tell him to hold his hands
I wish I were senseless sir so that I wouldn’t feel your punches
The only thing you can sense are punches just like an ass
I am an ass indeed you can tell by my long ears
I figure that once he’s crippled me I’ll beg by showing off my beatings
That’s enough
My wife’s coming
Mistress think about your end beware of your death
EPHESUS Now what do you think
Your husband’s mad isn’t he
He’s trembling in his fit
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven
Shut up you doddering old wizard
I’m not possessed
Oh I wish you weren’t you poor frightened soul
Listen hussy is this man one of your customers
Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house
Ate at home
You there rogue what do you have to say about that
I swear sir you did not eat at home
My doors were locked and I was shut out right
By God your doors were locked and you were shut out
And she screamed at me right
No lie she screamed at you
And her cook yelled mocked and teased me right
And I departed in a rage right
You truly did
Good idea
I gave it to Dromio who rushed in for it
You gave money to me
Didn’t you go to her for a purse full of ducats
He did and I gave it to him
And I saw her do it
I was sent for a rope
Mistress both the man and his master are possessed
I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look
We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room
My sweet husband I did not lock you out
And my sweet master I received no gold
But I agree sir that we were locked out
Keep him away from me
We need more help
The devil in him is strong
jailer i’m your prisoner
are you going to let them break me out of jail
Gentlemen let go of him
He’s my prisoner and you can’t have him
Tie up the servant for he is mad as well
He’s my prisoner
If I let him go I’ll have to pay his bail fees myself
I’ll pay you
Take me to the man my husband is in debt to
What a horrible day
What a horrible slut
Master I’m all tied up for you
The poor souls how strangely they talk
Angelo the jeweler
Do you know him
I know him
Two hundred ducats
For what
For a necklace your husband had him make
He said he was going to buy me a necklace but I never saw it
I need to hear the truth about all this
God have mercy on us
And they’ve got their swords unsheathed
Let’s call for help and get them tied up again
Let’s get out of here
They’ll kill us
It looks like these witches are scared of swords
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you
I wish we were safely on board our ship already
Look let’s stay here tonight
Nobody will hurt us
You see how kind everyone is to us how they just hand us gold
I think this country is so kind that if it weren’t for
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself
I wouldn’t stay here tonight for the entire town
Go and get our stuff onto the ship
What’s this man’s reputation like here in the city
I’d trust him with everything I own
You’re right
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn’t have
Good sir stay close to me
So tell people that you’re from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated
Here’s the money you asked me to hold
Dromio bring this money to the Centaur Inn where we’re lodging and wait there until I come
It’ll be lunchtime within an hour
Until then I’ll walk around town peruse the markets and gaze upon the buildings and then I’ll return and sleep at the inn
Get going now
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money
Often when I’m dulled by worry and melancholy he lightens my mood with his merry pranks
Listen will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn
But if
I got it from you I never said I didn’t
Yes you did sir
Who heard me do that
My own ears heard it and you know it
To hell with you
It’s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men
You’re a villain to say this about me
I’ll prove that I’m an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself
I do dare and I say that you are the villain
Run master run
For God’s sake find a house to duck into
This looks like an abbey
Go in or we’re done for
Be quiet people
Why have you come here in such a mob
To get my poor mad husband out from inside there
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover
How long has he been possessed like this
This week he was sad moody and depressed and very different from his usual self
But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence
That’s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander
Which of these bad things happened to him
You should have reprimanded him for that
I did
Fine but you weren’t harsh enough
You scolded him in private
And in public too
Fine but not enough
He couldn’t eat without me talking about it
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was
And that’s why he went crazy
A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog
You seasoned his food with screams
Fever as we know is a kind of madness
Ruining his meals his enjoyment and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad
What I’m saying is your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity
Gentlemen go in there and grab him
Then have your servants bring him out
Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows it is a charitable duty my order performs
Therefore depart and leave him here with me
Be quiet and depart
You’re not going to take him
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke
Come with me
I’ll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey
It’s almost five o'clock
To see an elderly unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus
Here they come
We will watch the execution
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey
One more time we proclaim this publicly If anyone will pay this man’s bail he will not be put to death
Duke the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice
She’s a virtuous and holy lady
She can’t possibly have done you any wrong
So please most gracious duke order her to bring him out so we can get him some help
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him
Shut up fool
Your master and his servant are here
Mistress I swear on my life that it’s true
It was just moments ago
He’s crying out for you and swears he’ll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you
Oh my it’s my husband
Look he can become invisible
Just now we put him in the abbey over here and now he’s over there
In exchange for the blood I shed for you then I ask you for justice now
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination
Today great duke she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores
That’s terrible
No my good lord
I ate with him and my sister
Damn my soul if these accusations are true
If she’s lying I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day
Oh lying woman
My lord I know what I’m saying
He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine where I was dining with Balthasar
He hadn’t arrived by the time we finished eating so I went out looking for him
I met him in the street he was there with that man
On the way we came across my wife her sister and their gang of vile associates
One of them was a man named Pinch a hungry narrow faced villain a skeleton a fraud a raggedy magician and fortune teller a needy hollow eyed emaciated wretch a walking corpse
He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse
They left me and my servant there tied together
He did my lord
I never saw the necklace so help me heaven
Why what a complicated case this is
it pleases you I’ll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime
Right now my pressing business calls me away
Farewell till then
I will go lose myself wandering up and down throughout the city
Sir I leave you to your own contentment
He leaves me to my own contentment but that’s the one thing I cannot find
Out in the world I’m like a drop of water trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean
In order to find a mother and a brother I too have lost myself unhappily
How is it that you’ve come back so soon
Back so soon
Too late is more like it
The chicken is burning the pig is overcooked the clock has already struck twelve and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek
ate at home but the jeweler says he didn’t
Sir he ate with this woman at the Porcupine
He did and he snatched my ring right off my finger
That’s true my lord I did get this ring from her
Did you see him enter this abbey
As clearly as I see you my lord
I think you’re all either bewildered or stark raving mad
Mighty duke please allow me to say something
I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life
I was bound to him an hour ago sir but thankfully he chewed through our ropes
Now I’m Dromio and no longer attached to him
I’m sure you both remember me
You’re not one of Pinch’s patients are you sir
Why are you looking at me so strangely
You know me well
I never saw you before in my life
Oh grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me
But tell me this don’t you know my voice
No
Don’t you Dromio
No sir trust me I do not
You don’t know my voice
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak sorrow ravaged voice
But I still have a little memory left and there’s still some fire in my eyes my dull deaf ears can still hear a little
All these aging faculties tell me and I cannot be wrong that you are my son Antipholus
I never saw my father in my life
You know that we parted only seven years ago in Syracuse
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things
Mighty duke look here and see a man who’s been treated most terribly
Either my eyes deceive me or I see two husbands
I sir am Dromio
Command this man to leave
I sir am Dromio
Pray let me stay
Oh my old master Who tied him up
Tell us old Egeon are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia who gave birth to two fair sons
Oh if you are the same Egeon speak now and speak to that same Emilia
These two Antipholuses who look so alike and these two Dromios who seem to have the same face and her story of being shipwrecked why these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident
If I’m not dreaming you are Emilia
If it’s really you tell me what happened to our son who floated away with you on that deadly raft
Antipholus aren’t you originally from Corinth
Wait don’t stand next to each other
I can’t tell who’s who
I came from Corinth Your Highness
And I came with him
Your renowned uncle Duke Menaphon the famous soldier brought me here
Which of you two ate lunch with me today
I did kind lady
And you’re my husband right
That’s the necklace I gave you sir
I think it is sir
I don’t deny it
And you sir had me arrested over that necklace
I think I did sir
I don’t deny it
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail but I don’t think he brought it to you
No he didn’t get any by me
I got this purse full of money from you and my Dromio brought it to me
I want to use this money to set my father free
That’s not necessary
I’m going to let him live
Sir I must get that diamond ring back from you
There take it and thanks for taking such good care of me
Renowned duke please join us in the abbey where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us
Duke Solinus my husband and both my children and you two Dromios who marked the day of my sons' births with your own come into the abbey with me for a new christening
After such a long period of grief we will have such a celebration
With all my heart I’ll join you
Dromio what stuff of mine did you put on a ship
The stuff you had at the Centaur sir
I’m your master Dromio
You have a fat friend at your master’s house she took care of me in the kitchen today thinking I was you
I guess now she’s going to be my sister in law and not my wife
I think you’re my mirror not my brother
Do you want to go in and join the party
After you sir
You’re older than me
That’s a good point
How can we tell which of us is the oldest
We’ll draw straws
Meanwhile after you
We came into the world as brother and brother so now let’s enter hand in hand not one before the other
Hold on a second
Answer me this please where’s the money I gave you
Oh the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress
The saddle maker has it sir I didn’t keep it
I’m not in a joking mood
Tell me right now and stop fooling where’s the money
We’re strangers here
Please sir crack jokes over lunch
I should think that your appetite would act like a clock (as mine does) and bring you home on its own without the need for a messenger
That’s enough Dromio please
This isn’t a good moment for jokes save them till a happier time
Where’s the gold I gave you
Gave me sir
You didn’t give me any gold
Tell me what you’ve done with the money I entrusted to you
The only thing that I’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house the Phoenix for lunch
My mistress and her sister are waiting for you
Tell me where you’ve stowed away my money or I swear I’ll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I’m not in the mood
Where are the thousand
Your mistress’s marks
What mistress do you have
What are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to
There take that you scoundrel
What are you doing
Stop for God’s sake
Well if you don’t then I’m out of here
I swear somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money
They say that this town is full of deception illusionists that can fool the eye dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind soul killing witches who can disfigure your body disguised swindlers fast talking fakers and all kinds of other unchecked sins
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned even though I sent the slave off running
Surely Luciana it’s already two o'clock
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch
Sister let’s eat and stop worrying
A man is master of his own freedom time is his only master and when the right moment comes along he’ll come or go as he pleases
If this is so be patient sister
Why should men be more free than women
Because their business lies outside the home
Why too much freedom leads to woe
Therefore you should obey their wishes
It’s this servantlike mentality that’s keeping you unmarried
No that’s not it it’s because of what happens in the marriage bed
But if you were married you’d wield some influence
Before I learn how to love I’ll learn how to follow orders
What if your husband strays elsewhere
I’d endure it until he came home again
Now that’s patience
No wonder she’s waiting to get married
When we’re faced with a wretched person bruised and crying with hardship we try to get them to shush up
But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights this foolish patience will abandon you
Well I’ll get married one day just to see
Tell me is your tardy master close at hand
Do you know his plans
But please tell me is he coming home
It seems he has taken great care to please his wife
Why mistress my master is as angry as a bull with horns
You bastard
I don’t mean he’s
My mistress” I said
Damn your mistress
My master said it
I don’t know” he said “any house wife or mistress” My message which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth ended up being carried back home by my shoulders
Go back again slave and bring him home
Go back again to be beaten home again
For God’s sake send somebody else
Go back slave or I’ll knock you one across the head
Get out of here you blathering peasant
Bring your master home
You kick me out he kicks me back
Look at you
You have impatience all over your face
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him
Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks
Have I lost my wit
One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty
But like an unruly deer he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures
I am nothing but a poor used fool
Drive it out of you
I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman or why wouldn’t he be here
Sister you know he promised to give me a necklace
I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me
Even the best jewel can be tarnished
And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior
Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy
Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles
Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns
No–the law goes further if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse’s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus that man dies and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself
Therefore by law you are condemned to die
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me
I haven’t spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier
Here he comes
So sir
Are you over your ridiculous mood
You never heard of the Centaur
You weren’t given any gold
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner
The Phoenix is my house
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly
Said what sir
When did I say all that
I haven’t seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me
And I hope you realized I wasn’t very happy about it
I’m glad to see you in such a merry mood
But what’s the joke
Please master tell me
What are you mocking me to my face
Here
Take that and that
Stop sir for God’s sake
Now this joke has turned serious
Why are you doing this
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me you try to take advantage of my affection
You call it my “ Don’t you know
Should I tell you why
Well thank you
Because you gave me something for nothing
Next time I’ll give you nothing for something
Is it lunchtime
What would that be
A basting
Well then it will be dry
If it is I suggest you don’t eat it
Why not
Because it will make you angry and that will get me another beating
Well learn to make jokes at the appropriate time
There’s a time for all things
Before you got so angry I never would have thought that
Why not
I’ll tell you it’s because of a law as plain as Father Time’s bald head
Let’s hear it
There may be a time for everything but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence
So then you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded
Two reasons
And good ones too
Not good ones please
Then sure ones
No not sure ones when we’re talking about something unsure
Then certain ones
Name them
One so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling and two so that when their hair falls out it doesn’t land in their dinner
You were supposed to be proving that there isn’t time for everything
Then I’ll change it to this Father Time himself is bald so for all time there will be bald men
There was a time when you’d freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it
How is it my husband oh how is it that you have become a stranger to yourself
Ah don’t tear yourself away from me
I don’t know you
Why are you treating my sister like this
She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch
Dromio
And this is what you told me he said that he beat you and pretended his house wasn’t his and I wasn’t his wife
Did you talk with this woman
What kind of scheme do you have going together
Me sir
I never saw her till now
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace
I never talked with her in my life
What was I married to her in a dream
Or am I asleep now and imagining all this
What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely
Until I know for sure I’ll humor her
Dromio tell the servants to prepare for lunch
Oh I wish I had my rosary
I’ll cross myself
This must be some kind of fairyland
Oh spite of spites
If we don’t obey them they’ll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you
Dromio you drone you snail you slug you idiot
I’ve been transformed somehow haven’t I master
No master I’ve been changed in both mind and body
That’s true
I must be as stupid as an ass that’s why I don’t know her but she knows me
I won’t play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me
Come husband let’s go to lunch
Husband I’ll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you’ve pulled
Am I on earth in heaven or in hell
know myself
Master should I watch the door
Yes and don’t let anyone come in or else I’ll break your head
Well Syracusian tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus
And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad
In the same hour and in the same inn a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys
Reluctantly I agreed–alas
Too quickly we boarded a ship
Signior Angelo please excuse us
Here’s the story we’ll tell her that I was with you at your shop watching you make her necklace and that you’re going to deliver it tomorrow
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him told him I’d given him a thousand marks in gold and then lied about my wife and my house
Say what you want but I know what I know
I think you’re an ass
Signior Balthasar you look upset
Your delicacies aren’t worth as much to me as your welcome is
Good food’s not a big deal everyone can afford that
And everyone can say “welcome” which is just a word
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast
Sure to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest
But look even if my dishes are poor eat them with my best wishes
You may come across better food but not a warmer welcome
What’s this
My door is locked
Maud Bridget Marian Ciceley Gillian Ginn
My master is standing out in the street
Who’s in there
Hey open the door
A reason
So I can eat lunch
I haven’t eaten today
Who do you think you are keeping me out of my own house
You’ve stolen both my job and my name
Oh Lord this makes me laugh
I’ll come at you with the old proverb “Should I make myself at home”
Listen up you slave
Are you going to let us in
Come help me bang on the door master
Well done
We answered them blow for blow
You good for nothing let me in
Master knock hard upon the door
If I break the door down slave you’ll be sorry for this
Is that you wife
You could have come sooner
If she punishes you master she’s sure to punish me
We argued about which was best and now we won’t get either one
And if your clothes were as thin as mine you’d really feel the air
The food inside is warm but you’re out here freezing
It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this
Go get me something I can use to break down the door
I’ve had enough of this “off with you” Come on let me in
Well I’m going to break in
Go get me a crow
A crow without feathers
Master do you really mean that
I meant a crowbar
Get going already
Be patient sir
Don’t do this
All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you
Let’s assume that she has a reason which you don’t know yet have faith that she’ll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today
You’re right I’ll go quietly
And even though I’m in a distasteful mood I’ll work on being happy
I know a terrific wench
We’ll eat at her place
I swear to her that I haven’t but it doesn’t change anything
I’ll meet you there in an hour
Do that
This little prank of hers is going to cost me
Is the building of your love already in ruins
If you married my sister for her wealth then for her wealth’s sake treat her with more kindness
What foolish thief brags about his crimes
It’s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes
We follow in your orbit and you have the power to move us
So my sweet brother in law go inside
Sweet mistress I don’t know what other name to give you or how you’ve figured out mine you seem as
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine
Teach me how I should think and speak
Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction
Are you a god
Are you trying to remake me
Go ahead I’ll yield to your power
But if I am myself then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife
I don’t owe her any duty it’s you that I submit to
Oh sweet mermaid don’t command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister’s tears
Are you insane talking like this
Your eyes are playing tricks on you
That’s because you are near me and you’re as dazzling as the sun
Why are you calling me “love”
Call my sister that
Your sister’s sister
That’s my sister
My food my fortune my sweetest hope my heaven on earth and my entrance to heaven
My sister is all those things or else she should be
Call yourself your own sister because I want you
Give me your hand
Oh wait sir
Stay here
I’ll go get my sister and see what she thinks
What’s going on Dromio
Where are you running so fast
Do you know me
Am I Dromio
Am I your servant
Am I myself
It carried us toward Corinth–or so we thought
But before they reached us–let me say no more
You are Dromio you are my servant and you are yourself
I’m an ass I’m a woman’s servant and I’m beside myself
What woman’s servant
What do you mean beside yourself
How does she claim to own you
I don’t mean that she wants me because  What’s she like
The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by
Her
Even if she lives till the end of the world she’d keep burning an additional week
What’s her skin like
It’s dark like my shoe
Some water will fix that
No it’s permanent
What’s her name
Nell
She’s round like a globe
What part of her body is Ireland
Her bottom
Honestly I didn’t see it but I felt it in her hot breath
Where’s America and the West Indies
Oh sir on her nose which is covered with pimples sores and red welts
And I think that if I hadn’t been brave and strong she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave
If there’s enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight I won’t spend tonight in this town
If a ship’s leaving come to the marketplace
If everyone here knows us but we don’t know anybody it’s time I think for us to pack our bags and take off
I’ll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as I’d run from a bear
That means it’s high time for me to go
That woman who claims I am her husband I loathe her in my soul
I’d better stop up my ears against this siren’s song
I know that sir
Look here’s the necklace
What do you want me to do with this
Whatever you want I made it for you
Made it for me
I didn’t order it
You did not just once or twice but twenty times
You’re a funny man sir
Take care
I don’t know what to think about this
I’ll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace
If any ships are sailing I’ll get right on one
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you
At five o'clock he’s going to pay me for it
Please come to his house with me
The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman
Please pay him immediately
I don’t have the cash right now
Besides I have some business to take care of in town
So you’ll bring the necklace to her yourself
All right sir I will
Do you have it with you
Listen please give me the necklace
The wind is right and it’s high tide and I’ve delayed him a long time already
Good Lord
You’re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it but you started fighting with me first
It’s getting late
Please sir hurry up
Antipholus you hear how the man pleads with me
Give me the necklace
Give it to my wife and get your money
Come come
You know I gave it to you just now
Send the necklace to her or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me
Damn it this isn’t funny
Where’s the necklace
Let me see it
Pay you
What should I pay you
The money you owe me for the necklace
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago
You wrong me even more sir by denying it
Consider how poorly this reflects on me
I will
This harms my reputation
Pay for something I never got
Go ahead you fool
Arrest me if you dare
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly
You’re under arrest sir
You hear the charges
I’ll obey you until I can make bail
But Angelo you’ll pay for this even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop
Sir the laws of Ephesus will be on my side and you’ll be embarrassed
No keep going old man don’t stop like that
For we may take pity on you even if we can’t pardon you
Had the gods taken pity on us I wouldn’t be here calling them merciless
It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes
And for the sake of those you grieve for do me a favor tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them up to this point
I’ve left our luggage on the ship and I bought the oil balm and liquor you wanted
You annoying idiot what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me
A ship you sent me to find to book passage out of here
You drunken slave I sent you for a rope and I told you what to do with it
Yeah right you sent me to get whipped
You sent me to the port to find a ship
I’ll debate this with you later and then I’ll teach you to listen more carefully
Go to Adriana you scoundrel and quickly
Give her this key and tell her that there’s money in the desk that’s covered with a Turkish tapestry
Have her send it to me
Tell her that I’ve been arrested and the money will be my bail
Hurry you slave
Go
To Adriana
Where that “sweetheart” said I was her husband
She’s too much for me to handle
But I must go there against my will servants must fulfill their masters' wishes
Oh Luciana did he tempt you like that
Sad or happy
First he said you had no right to him
He meant he did nothing right for me which is true unfortunately
Then he swore he was a stranger here
And that’s true he  Then I pleaded for you
And what did he say
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you
How did he try to persuade you to love him
Have some patience please
Then why be jealous of a person like that
When an evil thing has been lost no one cries
Oh but I think of him more highly than I say I do and I wish he looked worse in other women’s eyes
My heart adores him even though my tongue curses him
How did you lose your breath
By running fast
Where’s your master Dromio
Is he all right
No he’s in a place worse than hell
A backbiting friend one who grabs people who patrols the streets and passageways
Speak man what’s the matter
Tell me who had him arrested
I don’t know who had him arrested but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather
Get it sister
How could he be in debt without me knowing it
Don’t you hear it ring
What the necklace
No no the bell
It’s time for me to go
It was two o'clock when I left him and now it’s one
I’ve never heard of that
Of course
You sell fish
No not me sir
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller
Good sir
Yes sir
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world
That’s definitely true my lord
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog kissing the corpse by the way do you have a daughter
I do indeed my lord
Then by all means never let her walk in public
Procreation is a good thing but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out friend
A lot of words
And what is the subject
Between whom
I mean what do the words say
Oh just lies sir
Into my grave
Well that’s certainly out of this world all right
You can’t take anything from me that I care less about except my life except my life except my life
Good bye my lord
You’re looking for Lord Hamlet
He’s right over there
Thank you sir
My lord
My dear sir
Ah my good old friends
How are you Guildenstern
And Rosencrantz
Boys how are you both doing
Happy that we’re not too happy lucky in being not too lucky
But you’re not down and out either are you
So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist
Yes we’re the privates in her army
Anyway what’s up
But you’re wrong
Let me ask you a particular question
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison
Prison my lord
Denmark’s a prison
Then I guess the whole world is one
Yes quite a large one with many cells and dungeons Denmark being one of the worst
We don’t think so my lord
Well then it isn’t one to you since nothing is really good or bad in itself it’s all what a person thinks about it
And to me Denmark is a prison
That must be because you’re so ambitious
It’s too small for your large mind
Dreams are a sign of ambition since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream
But a dream itself is just a shadow
In fact I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it’s only the shadow of a shadow
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars
Should we go inside
Well then I thank you though I’m such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much
Or was it just your whim on your own initiative
What should we say my lord
You were sent for
I know the king and queen sent for you
Why would they do that my lord
That’s what I want you to tell me
My lord we were sent for
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day
Who can explain this to me
I can
Or at least I can describe the rumors
So why did you laugh when I said that men don’t interest me
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield the lover will be rewarded for his sighs the crazy character can rant all he wants the clown will make everybody laugh and the lady character can say whatever’s on her mind or I’ll stop the play
Which troupe is it
The tragic actors from the city the ones you used to enjoy so much
What are they doing on the road
They made more money and got more attention in the city
But things have changed there and it’s easier for them on the road now
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city
Do they attract big audiences
No not like before
Why
Are they getting rusty
No they’re busy and as excellent as ever
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it
These child actors are now in fashion and they’ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all they’re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys
What you mean kid actors
Who takes care of them
Who pays their way
Will they stop working when their voices mature
Aren’t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors which they are going to grow up and become
There’s been a whole debate on the topic
For a while no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children’s playwright and the actors playing adult roles
Are you kidding
Oh there’s been a lot of quarreling
And the boys are winning so far
Actually it’s not so unusual when you think about it
My uncle is king of Denmark and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him
There’s something downright unnatural about it if a philosopher stopped to think about it
The actors are here
Gentlemen welcome to Elsinore
Don’t be shy shake hands with me
And if we don’t shake hands when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I’m happier to see them than you
You are very welcome here
But still my uncle father and aunt mother have got the wrong idea
In what sense my lord
I’m only crazy sometimes
At other times I know what’s what
Gentlemen I hope you are well
Listen Guildenstern and you too Rosencrantz listen as close as you can
Yes the second time around since as they say old people become children again
My lord I have news for you
My lord I have news for you
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome   The actors have arrived my lord
Yawn snore
I swear   each actor arrived on his ass
Well        Aren’t I right Jephthah old man
If you’re calling me Jephthah my lord I do have a daughter I love more than anything yes
What is logical then my lord
Why
Welcome welcome to all of you
Which speech my lord
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play with well ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy
I loved one speech in particular
This speech is going on too long
We’ll have the barber trim it later along with your beard
The muffled queen”
That’s good
The muffled queen” is good
Look how flushed the actor is with tears in his eyes
My lord I will give them all they deserve
Good heavens man give them more than that
Treat them with honor and dignity
The less they deserve the more your generosity is worth
Lead them inside
Come everyone
Follow him friends
We’ll watch a whole play tomorrow
Yes my lord
Then we’ll see that tomorrow night
By the way if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play you could learn it by heart for tomorrow right
Yes my lord
Very well
Follow that gentleman now and be careful not to make fun of him
My good friends I’ll see you tomorrow
Welcome to Elsinore
Yes my lord
Now I’m alone
Oh what a mean low life I am
For Hecuba
The ghost is definitely something to worry about
In the high and mighty Roman Empire just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish
Wait look
It has come again
I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do
If you have a voice or can make sounds speak to me
Am I a coward
Pull off my beard
Pinch my nose
Call me the worst liar
Bloody inhuman villain
Remorseless treacherous sex obsessed unnatural villain
Ah revenge
What an ass I am
Damn it
Murder has no tongue but miraculously it still finds a way to speak
If he becomes pale I know what to do
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with
The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king
And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy
Did he treat you well when you saw him
Yes in a very gentlemanly way
He didn’t ask questions but answered ours at length
Madam some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here
They are here at court now and I believe they’ve been told to give a performance for him tonight
It’s true and he asked me to beg you both to attend
It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested
Gentlemen please try to sharpen his interest even more and let this play do him some good
We will my lord
Yes I’ll go
I hope so too Madam
Ophelia come here    I hear him coming
Quick let’s hide my lord
Dying sleeping that’s all dying is a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us that’s an achievement to wish for
To die to sleep to sleep maybe to dream
That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long
After all who would put up with all life’s humiliations the abuse from superiors the insults of arrogant men the pangs of unrequited love the inefficiency of the legal system the rudeness of people in office and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t
But  Hello my lord how have you been doing lately
Very well thank you
Well well well
My lord I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now
Please take them
There my lord
Ha ha are you good
Excuse me
Are you beautiful
My lord what are you talking about
I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness
Sure since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin
This used to be a great puzzle but now I’ve solved it
I used to love you
You certainly made me believe you did my lord
I didn’t love you
Then I guess I was misled
Get yourself to a
I am arrogant vengeful ambitious with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts and more than I have time to carry it out in
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven
Every one of us is a criminal
Don’t believe any of us
Hurry to a convent
Where’s your father
He’s at home my lord
Lock him in so he can play the fool in his own home only
Good bye
Oh dear God please help him
Get yourself to a convent at once
Good bye
Good bye
Dear God please make him normal again
I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too
God gives you one face but you paint another on top of it
You dance and prance and lisp you call God’s creations by pet names and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance
Come on I won’t stand for it anymore
It’s driven me crazy
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage
Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married all but one person
Everyone else will have to stay single
Get yourself to a convent fast
Love
His feelings don’t move in that direction
With any luck the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind
What do you think of this plan
It should work
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love Hello Ophelia
You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said
I’ll hide and listen in
If she can’t find out what his secret is then send him off to England or wherever you think best
That’s how we’ll do it then
If there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor speak to me
Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere which they say often makes ghosts restless then tell us about it
Stay and speak
Keep it from leaving Marcellus
Should I strike it with my spear
Yes if it doesn’t stand still
It’s over here
There it is
It’s gone
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed
Perform the speech just as I taught you musically and smoothly
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical
Please avoid doing that
I will sir
But don’t be too tame either let your good sense guide you
I hope we’ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company sir
Oh correct it completely
Make sure that the clowns do not ad lib since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed
Yes he will and the queen as well
Tell the actors to hurry
Will you two help them get ready
Yes my lord
Well hello there Horatio
Here I am at your service my dear lord
Horatio you’re the best man I’ve ever known
Oh sir  Don’t think I’m flattering you
What could I hope to get from you who’ve got nothing but your charm to support you in life
Why would anyone flatter a poor person
No keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well
You understand
Ever since I’ve been a free agent in my choice of friends I’ve chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance grateful for both good and bad
Watch him closely
They’re coming
I can’t talk now
Take your seat
So how’s my nephew Hamlet doing
Wonderful
I eat the air like chameleons do
I’m positively stuffed with air I eat so much of it
I have no idea what you’re talking about Hamlet
You’re not answering my question
Mine neither
Indeed I did my lord
What role did you play
I played Julius Caesar
I was killed in the Capitol
Brutus killed me
Yes my lord
They’re ready whenever you are
No thanks my good mother
There’s a nicer piece of work right here
My lady should I lie in your lap
No my lord
I mean with my head in your lap
Yes my lord
Did you think I was talking about sex
What is my lord
Nothing
You’re in a good mood tonight my lord
Who me
Yes my lord
Oh God who is by the way the best comic of them all
What can you do but be happy
Look how cheerful my mother is only two hours after my father died
No my lord it’s been four months
As long as that
I’ll get myself a fur trimmed suit
In that case there’s reason to hope a man’s memory may outlive him by six months
But he’s got to build churches for that to happen my lady or else he’ll have to put up with being forgotten like the hobby horse in the popular song that goes “Heigh ho heigh ho the hobby horse is forgotten”   What does this mean my lord
This means we’re having some mischievous fun
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play
This guy will tell us everything
Actors can’t keep a secret
They’ll tell all
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant
Sure or anything else you show him
As long as you aren’t ashamed to show it he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means
You’re naughty
I’m watching the play
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring
It was a bit short my lord
Yes as short as a woman’s love
Madam how are you liking this play
The lady’s overdoing it I think
Oh but she’ll keep her word
Is there anything offensive in it
Not offensive at all
What’s the play called
Yes it faded away when the rooster crowed
Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this out of duty and love
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me
We’re all waiting for the revenge
The original story was written in the finest Italian
You’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago’s wife
The king is getting up
What is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank
My lord how are you feeling
Get me out of here
Lights lights get us some lights
No a whole share for me
Did you notice
Yes I did my lord
When the actors were talking about poison
I watched him very closely
Ah ha
Hey let’s have some music here
Play your flutes
Come on music
My lord could I have a word with you
You can have a whole story not just a word
Sir the king  Yes what about him
He’s in his chambers now and he’s extremely upset
I’ll be good sir
Go ahead
The queen your mother is upset and sent me to see you
It’s lovely to see you
No my lord your polite words are not to the point
If you could please stop fooling around I’ll tell you what your mother wants
If not I’ll leave you alone and that’ll be the end of my business
Sir I can’t
Can’t what my lord
Stop fooling around
My mind is confused
Okay to the point
Oh what a wonderful son I can impress my mother
But what’s the upshot of her admiration
Do tell
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed
I’d obey even if she were my mother ten times over
Is there anything else I can do for you
My lord you used to like me
And still do I swear by my hands
My lord what’s wrong with you
Sir I have no future ahead of me
But how can you say that when the king himself says you’re the heir to the Danish throne
I don’t really understand what you mean
Will you play this recorder
I can’t my lord
Please
I’m serious I can’t
I’m begging you
I have no idea how
Oh it’s as easy as lying
But I can’t play a melody
I don’t know how
My God do you think I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe
You can push my buttons but you can’t play me for a fool
Hello and God bless you sir
My lord the queen wants to speak with you right away
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel
By God it does look like a camel
To me it looks like a weasel
It does have a back like a weasel’s
Or like a whale
Yes very much like a whale
I’ll go see my mother soon
I’ll tell her
This is the time of night when witches come out when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight
I’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her but I won’t use one on her
And so my words and thoughts will be at odds
I don’t like the way he’s acting and it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control
So get prepared
I’m sending you to England on diplomatic business and Hamlet will go with you
As king I cannot risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour
We’ll take care of it
When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but like a whirlpool draws others with him
He’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things when it falls down the mountain every little object goes down with it
Whenever a king sighs everyone groans
Prepare yourself please for this trip
We’ll put a leash on this danger that’s now running wild
We’ll hurry
My lord Hamlet’s going to his mother’s room
I’ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say
I bet she’ll chew him out
And as you said (and you said it wisely) it’s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them since she can be too partial to him
Goodbye my lord
I’ll stop by before you go to bed and tell you what I’ve heard
Thanks my dear lord
It has the mark of
So much for Fortinbras
That won’t work since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder my crown and my queen
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime
In this wicked world criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law shoving justice aside
But not in heaven
What is there left to do
But it can’t help either
My heart’s as black as death
My soul is stuck to sin and the more it struggles to break free the more it sticks
Help me angels
C’mon make an effort
I could do it easily now
He’s praying now
And now I’ll do it
He’ll come right away
I’ll be right here silent
Have you forgotten who I am
No sit down
What are you going to do
You won’t kill me will you
Repent and avoid damnation
Good night to you
Who would do that
What is it Laertes
What would you like Laertes
Please let me go
I have to go to England don’t you know that
What Gertrude
How is Hamlet
Oh this is terrible
His wildness is a threat to all of us to you to me to everyone
I’ve gotten it dirty ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Believe what
Besides you’re a sponge
You think I’m a sponge my lord
I’m glad about that
A thing of no importance
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment or nothing at all
But where is he
Bring him to me
At dinner
What do you mean by that
Where is Polonius
In heaven
So get ready to leave
Good
Don’t waste any time
I’ll tell him my lord
Go ahead then
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier
In the end I grudgingly consented
I hereby grant your request and hope you have a good time
So why does it seem so particular to you
So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it
Good bye sir
Start without me
My God
I have the motivation the willpower the ability and the means to do it
I won’t speak to her
She’s insistent
In fact she’s crazed
What does she want
Show her in
Please just listen
Oh ho
May God be at your table
Come driver
Good night ladies good night sweet ladies good night good night
Follow her
Listen
What is it
Where’s this so called king
Please wait
Thank you
Let him go Gertrude
Where’s my father
He’s dead
Don’t mess with me
Only my free will nothing else
Do you want to know who they are then
What’s that noise
Please remember love
It’s not manly
And you’re right to do so
Please come with me
Who are the people who want to speak with me
Sailors sir
They say they have letters for you
Show them in
Hello sir
God bless you
May He bless you too
He will sir if He wants to
I have a lot to tell you about them
Good bye
It looks that way
I didn’t see them
Laertes I want you to hear what they say
What does this mean
Do you recognize the handwriting
Naked” he says
And in a PS
But let him come
That’ll be fine
All your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did though to me it’s far from your best attribute
What quality is that my lord
Yes from Normandy
Yes that’s the one
I know him well
He’s his homeland’s jewel
How could you ask
That’s the right answer it shows your love
Let’s go
Damn it
But wait what’s that sound
Drowned
So she is drowned
Let’s follow him Gertrude
Let’s follow him
Here’s the water right
Is that how the law sees it
It sure is
The coroner’s inquest law
Do you want to know the truth
Well there now you’ve said it
Come on shovel
They keep up Adam’s profession
What aren’t you a Christian
I’ll ask you another question
If you can’t answer it  Go ahead
But how
Ah I’ve got it
Go ahead
Now go and get me some booze
Yes exactly
Indeed my lord
Exactly
There’s another
Could that be a lawyer’s skull
No more than that my lord
Yes my lord and calfskin too
It’s mine sir
For no man sir
How literal this guy is
You don’t know that
He’ll recover his sanity there
Why not
What do you mean “in a strange way”
On what grounds
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot
A leathermaker will last nine years
Whose was it
A crazy bastard
Who do you think
I really don’t know
Damn that crazy madman
This one
Yes that one
Are you sad about that
Horatio tell me something
Oh God do I have to remember that
She would hang on to him and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him she couldn’t get enough of him
Less than a month after my father’s death even before the tears on her cheeks had dried she remarried
That’s not good and no good can come of it either
Hello sir
Nice to see you again Horatio that is your name right
That’s me sir
I’ll change that name for you
Hello sir
What’s that my lord
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried
Exactly like that
And smelled like that too
Whew
Just as bad my lord
How low we can fall Horatio
Isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel
If you thought that you’d be thinking too much
No not at all
The great emperor Caesar dead and turned to clay might plug up a hole to keep the wind away
Oh to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall
But quiet be quiet a minute
Here comes the king the queen and the noblemen of court
Who are they following
Let’s stay and watch a while
What other rites are you going to give her
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her
Isn’t there any other rite you can perform
No nothing
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them
Lay her in the ground and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh
I’m telling you you jerk priest my sister will be an angel in heaven while you’re howling in hell
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl
Goodbye
Oh damn three times damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind
Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more
That’s no way to pray
Pull them apart
Oh my son what issue is that
I loved Ophelia
Forty thousand brothers if you added all their love together couldn’t match mine
What are you going to do for her
Oh he’s crazy Laertes
For the love of God be patient with him
Damn it show me what you’re going to do for her
Will you cry
Fight
Stop eating
Cut yourself
I’ll do all that
And if you rattle on about mountains then let them throw millions of acres over us
This is pure insanity
He’ll be like this for a little while
Then he’ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch
I always loved you
But it doesn’t matter
Please Horatio go with him
Who’s there
No who are  Long live the king
Is that Barnardo
Yes it’s me
You’ve come right on time
The clock’s just striking twelve
Go home to bed Francisco
Thanks for letting me go
It’s bitterly cold out and I’m depressed
Has it been a quiet night
I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak
Well good night
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight tell them to hurry
I think I hear them
That’s enough about that
Now I’ll tell you the other story about my journey
Do you remember the circumstances
How could I forget my lord
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep
It was worse than being a captive in chains
Is it possible
Yes please tell me
Do you want to know what I wrote
Yes my lord
I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket with the royal seal of Denmark on it
I folded up the new document signed it sealed it and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference
The next day we had our fight at sea and you know what happened after that
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it
Man they were asking for it
I don’t feel guilty about them at all
They got what they deserved
It’s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents
What a king Claudius is
Isn’t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword and an easy conscience
And wouldn’t I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm
He’ll find out soon what happened in England
Soon enough
But I have the meantime
I’ll be nice to him
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury
Hang on a minute who are you
Welcome back to Denmark my lord
Thank you kindly sir
My lord if you have a free moment I have a message from His Majesty
No thank you my lord
It’s very hot
It is rather cold indeed my lord
And yet I feel it’s very hot and humid which is bad for my complexion
Yes indeed it is sir
Very humid I can’t tell you how humid it is
My lord His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he’s placed a large bet on you
This is what it’s all about  Please I beg you  No my lord I’m comfortable like this thank you
Sir your description of him doesn’t detract from his good qualities though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin and even so you wouldn’t be able to keep up with him
I felt like skipping school sir
I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that and I won’t believe it from you
I know you’d never skip school
What are you doing here in Elsinore
I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave
Sir we came to see your father’s funeral
Please don’t make fun of me
I think you came to see my mother’s wedding instead
Well sir it’s true it came soon after
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet
Oh I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven Horatio than have lived through that terrible day
My father I think I see my father
Where sir
In my imagination Horatio
I saw him once
He was an admirable king
He was a great human being
He was perfect in everything
I’ll never see the likes of him again
You speak absolutely correctly sir
And what’s the point sir
Why are we talking about him like this
Sorry sir
I know you know something  Thanks for the compliment I’m happy you know that
But in fact it doesn’t say much
I’m sorry you were saying
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is 
I can’t admit that since you’d have to compare his excellence to mine
Excellent in fencing I mean sir
The rapier and the dagger
Those are only two of his weapons
But go on
The king has bet six Barbary horses and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed and they match the fencing accessories
What do you mean by “carriages”
The carriages sir are the hangers where the swords hang
Carriage” makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon
I prefer to call it a “hanger” But anyway
Six Barbary horses six French swords with accessories and three imaginatively designed carriages sounds like a French bet against the Danish
Why has all this been put on the table
The king sir has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes he won’t beat you by more than three hits
But what if my answer’s no
It’s my exercise time
My services are at your command
Thank you
It’s a good thing he’s here to recommend himself
No one else would
He used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away or wait awhile
I’ll do whatever the king wants
If he’s ready now so am I
Otherwise I’ll do it anytime as long as I’m able
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else
Right on cue
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes politely before you begin your match
She’s full of good advice
You’re going to lose this bet my lord
I don’t think so
I’ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France
With the handicap they’ve given me I think I’ll win
But I have a sinking feeling anyway
Oh well
I’ll say you’re not feeling well
You’ll do no such thing
I thumb my nose at superstitions
What’s important is to be prepared
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind then what does it mean to leave early
Let it be
Come shake hands with Laertes Hamlet
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so
Yes hand me one too
I’m going to make you look sharp Laertes
You’re making fun of me
No I swear I’m not
Yes my lord quite well
You’ve bet on the weaker fencer
I’ve seen both of you fence
But since Laertes is better we’ve given him a handicap
Yes my lord
Put the goblets of wine on that table
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit then let my soldiers give him a military salute
I’ll drink to Hamlet’s health and into his goblet I’ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings
Give me the goblets
Come on sir
Come on my lord
That was one hit
No it wasn’t
Referee
It was obviously a hit
Well let’s go on
Give me a goblet Hamlet this pearl’s yours
Here’s to your health
Give him the goblet
Set it down awhile
Let’s play
Another hit
What do you say
You got me I admit it
My son will win
He’s flabby and out of breath Here Hamlet take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness Hamlet
Thank you madam
Gertrude don’t drink that
Excuse me
I’ll drink it if I like
I’d better not drink now
I’ll drink later
Come on let me wipe your face
I doubt it
Get ready for the third hit Laertes
You’re just playing around
Come on give me your best shot
I sense you’re treating me like a child
You think so
Come on
Take this
Separate them
They’re overdoing it
No come on one more time
Take care of the queen
Both fencers are bleeding how do you feel my lord
How do you feel Laertes
Like a mouse caught in my own trap Osric
How’s the queen
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding
The drink the drink
I’ve been poisoned
Oh what evil
Lock the door
We’ve been betrayed
Find out who did it
I’m the one Hamlet
Hamlet you’re dead
No medicine in the world can cure you
You don’t have more than half an hour to live
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand sharp and dipped in poison
The foul plan backfired on me
Here I lie and will never get up again
Your mother’s been poisoned
I can’t speak anymore
The king the king’s to blame
Then get to work poison
Sir I think I saw him last night
Saw who
The king my father
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw with these gentlemen as witnesses
For God’s sake let me hear it
After midnight for two nights running these two guards Marcellus and Barnardo saw a figure that looked very much like your father in full armor from head to toe
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes while they turned quaking with fear and too shocked to speak
I knew your father
But where did this happen
Treason
Treason
Protect me my friends
I’ve only been hurt not killed
Here you goddamn incest breeding Danish murderer drink this
Is your little pearl in there
Follow my mother
He got what he deserved
He mixed that poison himself
Please forgive me as I forgive you Hamlet
You’re not responsible for my death and my father’s and I’m not responsible for yours
God will free you from blame
You’re alive
Not for a second
I’m more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane
Some of this liquor’s still left in the goblet
Please give me that goblet if you love me
Let go of it
I’ll get it from you I swear
Oh God Horatio what a damaged reputation I’m leaving behind me as no one knows the truth
If you ever loved me then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story
What are these warlike noises
Young Fortinbras returning in triumph from Poland is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors
Oh I’m dying Horatio
This strong poison’s overpowering me
I will not live to hear the news from England
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown
He’s got my vote as I die
Oh oh oh oh
What do I see here
What would you like to see
These corpses suggest mayhem
Oh proud Death what banquet are you preparing that you’ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke
This is a horrible sight
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
Who will thank us now
As for me I welcome my good luck with sadness
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities
Pick up the corpses
On the platform where we stand guard sir
Didn’t you talk to it
I did sir but it didn’t answer me
That’s very strange
I swear to God it’s true sir
We thought you ought to know about it
Yes I should know but it disturbs me
Are you on duty again tonight
Yes sir
It was armed you say
Armed sir
From head to toe
Yes from top to bottom sir
So you couldn’t see his face then
Oh yes we could sir
He had his helmet visor up
Was he pale or flushed and red faced
Very pale sir
Did he stare at you
The whole time
I wish I’d been there
Did it stay a long time
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred
No longer than that
Not the time I saw it
His beard was gray right
It was just like in real life dark brown with silver whiskers in it
I’ll stand guard with you tonight
Maybe it’ll come again
I bet it will
If it looks like my good father I’ll speak to it even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet
I ask you if you’ve kept this a secret keep doing so
Whatever happens tonight don’t talk about it
I’ll return the favor
So good bye for now
I’ll see you on the guards' platform between eleven and twelve tonight
We’ll do our duty to you sir
Give me your love instead as I give you mine
Good bye
My father’s ghost armed
Something’s wrong
I suspect some foul play
I wish the night were here already
Until then I have to remain calm
Bad deeds will be revealed no matter how people try to hide them
My belongings are on the ship already
Good bye
And my dear sister as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing let me hear from you write
Do you doubt I’ll write
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you just consider it a big flirtation the temporary phase of a hot blooded youth
It won’t last
Not a second more
No more than a minute
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands
Watch out Ophelia
Just keep your love under control and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease
So be careful
Fear will keep you safe
Young people often lose their self control even without any help from others
I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart
Don’t worry I won’t
I’ve been here too long
And here comes father
You’re still here
Shame on you get on board
The wind is filling your ship’s sail and they’re waiting for you
Here I give you my blessing again
And just try to remember a few rules of life
Don’t say what you’re thinking and don’t be too quick to act on what you think
Be friendly to people but don’t overdo it
Don’t be quick to pick a fight but once you’re in one hold your own
Listen to many people but talk to few
Hear everyone’s opinion but reserve your judgment
Good bye son
Your servants are waiting
It’s locked away in my memory and you’ve got the key
Good bye
What did he tell you Ophelia
Something about Hamlet
If things are the way people tell me they are and they’re only telling me this to warn me then I have to say you’re not conducting yourself with the self restraint a daughter of mine should show
What’s going on between you two
Tell me the truth
He’s offered me a lot of affection lately
Affection” That’s nothing
You’re talking like some innocent girl who doesn’t understand the ways of the world
Do you believe his “offers” as you call them
I don’t know what to believe father
Then I’ll tell you
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real
Offer yourself more respect or not to beat this word to death you’ll offer me the chance to be a laughing stock
Go on
And he’s made the holiest vows to me to back up what he says
These vows are just traps for stupid birds
I know when a man is on fire he’ll swear anything
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do
Do as I say
Now come along
I’ll do as you say father
Friends of this country
And servants of the Danish king
Good night to you both
Good bye
Who’s taken over the watch for you
Barnardo’s taken my place
Good night
Is Horatio here too
More or less
So tell us did you see that thing again tonight
I haven’t seen anything
Horatio says we’re imagining it and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now
That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it
Yes it’s definitely nippy
What time is it
A little before twelve I think
No it’s just after twelve I heard the clock strike
Really
I didn’t hear it
So it’s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear
What does that mean sir
Is that a tradition
Yes it is
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements as great as they are and lessens our reputations
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations
Look sir here it comes
Oh angels protect us
Whether you’re a good spirit or a cursed demon whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire whether your intentions are good or evil you look so strange I want to talk to you
I’ll call you “Hamlet Senior” “King” “Father” “royal Dane” Answer me
Don’t drive me crazy with curiosity but tell me why your church buried bones have burst out of their coffin and why your tomb
where we quietly buried you has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again
Why
It wants you to go off with it as if it wants to tell you something alone
Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place that’s farther away
But don’t go
Definitely not
Don’t do it sir
Why what’s the danger
And as for my soul how can the ghost endanger that since it’s as immortal as the ghost is
Look it’s waving me over again
I’ll follow it
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane
Think about it
It’s still waving to me
You’re not going sir
Let go of me
Calm down
You’re not going anywhere
Let me go gentlemen
I swear if anyone holds me back I’ll make a ghost of him
His imagination is making him crazy
Let’s follow them
It’s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone
No let’s follow him
Where are you taking me
Speak
Listen to me
I will
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory
Ah poor ghost
Speak
I’m ready to hear you
You must be ready for revenge too when you hear me out
What
I’m the ghost of your father doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins
If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of
make your eyes jump out of their sockets and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills
But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife
Listen listen
If you ever loved your poor dear father  Oh God
Take revenge for his horrible murder that crime against nature
Murder
His most horrible murder
Murder’s always horrible but this one was especially horrible weird and unnatural
You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of  I knew it
My uncle
Oh Hamlet how far she fell
She went from me who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine
So let me be brief here
And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life my crown and my queen all at once
Oh it’s horrible horrible so horrible
If you are human don’t stand for it
Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest
Leave her to God and her own guilt
Now good bye
The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade so morning is near
Good bye good bye good bye
Remember me
Ah all you up in heaven
And earth
What else
Shall I include hell as well
Damn it
Keep beating my heart and muscles don’t grow old yet keep me standing
Remember you
Yes you poor ghost as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head
Remember you
Yes I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there
Yes by God
Oh you evil woman
Oh you villain villain you damned smiling villain
Where’s my notebook It’s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile and be a villain
At least it’s possible in Denmark
He said “Remember me” I swore I would
Sir sir
Lord Hamlet  Please let him be all right
I’m all right
Oh ho ho sir
Oh ho ho kid
Come here
So how did it go sir
What happened sir
It was incredible
Oh please tell us sir
I swear I won’t sir
I won’t either sir
Okay
But you promise you can keep a secret
Yes I swear
Sit down for a while and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe about what we’ve seen two nights now
Well let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us
Last night when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now at one o'clock Marcellus and I  Quiet shut up
It’s come again
Looking just like the dead king
Very much so
It’s terrifying
It wants us to speak to it
Ask it something Horatio
By God I order you to speak
Any villain in Denmark is going to be well a villain
You don’t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that sir
Yes you’re absolutely right
So without further ado the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways
You go and take care of your business (since everybody has some business to take care of whatever it is worth) and I’ll go and pray
You’re talking in such a crazy way sir
No offense taken
Ah but there is Horatio there’s a lot of offense
As for this ghost we just saw he’s a real one I can tell you that much
But regarding what happened between us don’t ask I can’t tell you
And now my friends my courageous and educated friends do me one small favor
What is it sir
Of course we will
Don’t ever tell anyone what you’ve seen tonight
We won’t sir
No you have to swear it
I swear to God I won’t
Me too I won’t I swear to God
Swear by my sword
But we already swore sir
Yes but swear by my sword this time
Agree to swear
You swear never to mention what you’ve seen
Swear by my sword
Come over here gentlemen and put your hands on my sword again
Swear by my sword you’ll never mention what you’ve heard
You said it right old mole
What a tunneler
Let’s move again my friends
My God this is unbelievably strange
Then give it a nice welcome as you would give to any stranger
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio than you’ve even dreamed of
Swear you won’t
Let’s go back to court together but
Give him this money and these letters Reynaldo
I will sir
It would be wonderfully wise of you my dear Reynaldo to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him
That’s what I thought too sir
Excellent very good
Do you get what I’m saying Reynaldo
Yes very well sir
You should say “I sort of know him but not well
Isn’t he the one who’s always” and so on
Like gambling sir
That’s right or drinking swearing fist fighting visiting prostitutes that kind of thing
But that would ruin his reputation
Oh no not if you say it right
But sir  Why should you do this you want to know
Yes sir
I’d like to know
Yes sir
And then he’ll … he’ll … wait what was I about to say
Good God I was about to say something
What was I saying
I just saw him yesterday” or “the other day” or whenever it is you know “and there he was gambling” or “there he was totally wasted or fighting with somebody about a tennis match or going into a house of ill repute” that means a whorehouse you know or whatever
You get my point don’t you
Yes I do sir
God bless you
Have a safe trip
Thank you sir
I will sir
And I hope he’s studying his music like he’s supposed to
Got it sir
Good bye
From what in God’s name
Is he crazy with love for you
What did he say
He stayed like that a long time
Finally after shaking my arm a little and jerking his head up and down three times he sighed like it was his last breath
Come with me
I’ll go tell the king about this
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self destruct as much as any strong emotion
I’m so sorry
That’s what made him crazy
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation
Damn my suspicious thoughts
It’s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy
Come on let’s go see the king
Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away
You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet that’s the only word for it since inside and out he’s different from what he was before
I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself other than his father’s death
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command instead of asking us so politely
But we’ll obey
Thanks Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern
Thanks Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son who’s changed too much
Servants take these gentlemen to see Hamlet
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good
Amen to that
The ambassadors are back from Norway sir
Once again you bring good news
Do I sir
I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king
It looks like you’ve offended it
Look it’s going away
Stay
I order you speak
What’s going on Horatio
You’re pale and trembling
You agree now that we’re not imagining this don’t you
What do you think about it
I swear to God if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes I’d never believe it
Doesn’t it look like the king
Yes as much as you look like yourself
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles traveling on the ice in sleds
It’s weird
And I believe unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy
Tell me
I want very much to find out
All right but first let the ambassadors speak
Then you can hear my news as dessert
Then be so kind as to show them in
Gertrude he says he’s found out the reason for your son’s insanity
I doubt it’s anything but the obvious reason his father’s dying and our quick marriage
Welcome my good friends
Tell me Voltemand what’s the news from the king of Norway
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him and he ordered Fortinbras’s arrest
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand  I like this news and when I have time I’ll read this and think about how to reply
Meanwhile thank you for your efforts
Go relax now
Tonight we’ll have dinner
Welcome back
Well that turned out well in the end
Sir and madam to make grand speeches about what majesty is what service is or why day is day night is night and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day night and time
Your son is crazy
Crazy” I’m calling it since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness
But that’s another story
Think about it
I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter considering it her duty
Madam please be patient
I’ll read it to you
Oh Ophelia I’m bad at poetry
I can’t put my feelings into verse but please believe I love you best oh best of all
Believe it
Hamlet” Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter and more like it
And how did she react to all this
Sir what is your opinion of me
I know you are loyal and honorable
I would like to prove to you that I am
No I had to do something
And so I said to my daughter “Lord Hamlet is a prince he’s out of your league
It may be it certainly may be
Has there ever been a time I’d really like to know when I’ve definitely said something was true and it turned out not to be true
Not that I know of
What can we do to find out if it’s true
Well you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time
Yes he does
When he’s there next time I’ll send my daughter to see him
Please go away both of you
I’ll speak to him now
Oh please let me
How are you Hamlet
Fine thank you
Do you know who I am
The town is besieged and the trumpet calls us to the gap and we talk and do nothing by Christ
It’s a disgrace to us all
I swear by the mass before I close my eyes to go to sleep I’ll put in some good fighting or I’ll lie in the ground dead
Captain Macmorris I think see correct me if I’m wrong there are not many of your nation  My nation
What is my nation
It’s a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal
What is my nation
Who talks of my nation
Captain Macmorris if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant see I’ll have to think you’re not treating me with the good will you ought to see since I am as good a man as yourself both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself
So by Christ I’ll cut off your head
Now now both of you gentlemen
Yes and that’s a serious failing
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation
Captain Macmorris when we have more leisure see I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare and that’s that
What has the governor of the town decided
This is the final discussion I will grant
So submit to my mercy or like men who revel in their own destruction challenge me to do my worst
For as I am a soldier the name I think suits me best once I begin my attack on Harfleur again I will not leave the half conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes
The gates of mercy will be closed by then and harsh and hard hearted soldiers who have tasted blood will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it’s gotten rolling
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting
What do you say
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town
Today our hopes are at an end
The Dauphin whom we asked for reinforcements sends back the answer that he’s not yet in a position to raise so great an army
Therefore great king we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy
Open your gates
Come uncle Exeter enter Harfleur
Stay there and fortify it well against the French
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest tomorrow we’ll march on
No I’ll recite it for you right now “de hand de fangres de nails ” “De nails” madame
Ugh
That’s enough for one lesson
He’s certainly crossed the river Somme
And if he advances unopposed my lord let us abandon France
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation
God alive
If they march along unopposed I will sell my dukedom for a sodden filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion
Doesn’t the sun shine palely down on them as though in contempt killing their fruit with frowns
And shall our lively blood quickened by wine be so frosty
Where is Montjoy the herald
Send him on his way quickly
Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance
Rise princes and with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords rush to the battlefield Charles Delabreth High Constable of France you dukes of Orléans Bourbon Berri Alençon Brabant Bar and Burgundy Jaques Chatillon Rambures Vaudemont Beaumont Grandpré Roussi and Fauconberg Foix Lestrale Bouciqualt and Charolois
Stop Harry of England who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur
Have Montjoy hurry then Lord Constable and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war
Prince Dauphin you’ll stay with me in Rouen
No please I beg your Majesty
Be patient because you’re staying with me
Go now Lord Constable and all you princes and quickly bring us news of England’s defeat
Is the duke of Exeter safe
He is called Ensign Pistol
I don’t know him
Here he is
Captain I have a favor to beg of you
You’re on very good terms with the duke of Exeter
Yes God be praised I have managed to earn his favor
She provides an excellent moral
I’m glad to hear it
Discipline must be kept
Then die and be damned
Why that man is a total fraud and rascal
What he just said to me it’s alright
And what a beard trimmed like the general’s or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale you wouldn’t believe
But you must learn to recognize such liars or you will be greatly taken advantage of
If I find an opportunity I will give him a piece of my mind
Tell me Fluellen did you just come from the bridge
Yes your Majesty
The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly
The French have retreated see and there were great acts of courage
Indeed the enemy nearly took the bridge but he was forced to retreat and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge
I can tell your Majesty the duke is a brave man
What men have you lost Fluellen
The enemy’s losses have been very great pretty substantial
To tell the truth though I think the duke hasn’t lost a single man except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church one Bardolph I don’t know if your Majesty knows the man
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages nothing taken that is not paid for none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language
You know from my clothing who I am
Well then I know who you are
What do you have to tell me
My master’s decision
Go ahead
My king says this “Tell Harry of England though we appeared dead we were only asleep
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened
Now the time is right for us to speak and we do so with imperial authority
Favorably except that there wasn’t enough time for his Grace to hear as I sensed he would have liked to the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France and to the throne of France in general through clear lines of descent originating with his great grandfather Edward III
What kept you from telling him this
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king
And in fact I think they’re meeting together right now
Is it four o'clock
It is
Then let’s go in and hear what he has to say though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word
have lost and the indignity we have endured for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we’ve shed and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with
Add defiance to all this and by way of conclusion tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him whose death sentence has been pronounced” My king and master’s message delivered my task is done
What is your name
I know your position
Montjoy
You do your job well
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference for to be honest though it’s probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage my men are considerably weakened by illness my numbers reduced and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen though when they were in good form I tell you herald I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs
But God forgive me for bragging
Anyway go tell your master I am here
I’ll deliver the message
I thank your Highness
I hope they don’t attack us now
We’re in God’s hands brother not in theirs
March to the bridge
Night is approaching
I have the best armor in the world
I wish it were day
You have wonderful armor but give my horse his due
It is the best horse in Europe
Will it never be morning
My lord of Orléans and my lord high Constable are you talking about horses and armor
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world
What a long night this is
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs
The earth sings when he touches it
The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pan’s pipe
He’s the color of nutmeg
And hot as ginger
He is an animal worthy of Perseus
He is indeed worthy of the name “horse” and you can call all the rest beasts
Indeed my lord he is a perfectly wonderful horse
He is the prince of horses
His neigh is like a monarch’s command
Enough cousin
No the man who cannot extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever
It’s a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea
If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize my horse would be a topic for them all
He is a subject for a king to contemplate and for a king’s king to ride on and for the world at large both friend and stranger to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at
I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began “Wonder of nature ” I have heard a sonnet to one’s mistress that began like that
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed for my horse is my mistress
Your mistress is a good mount
So perhaps did yours
Mine wasn’t wearing a bridle
Oh then I guess she was old and gentle and you rode barelegged like an Irish yokel
You’re a good judge of horsemanship
Take a tip from me then
I’d rather have my horse than a mistress
I’d prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse
I’ll tell you this Constable my mistress has his own hair
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress
The dog returns to its own vomit and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle” You’d take anything for a mistress
At least I don’t have a horse for my mistress or a saying so beside the point
My Lord Constable are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight
Stars my lord
I hope some will fall off tomorrow
And yet I’ll still have plenty
No doubt for you wear too many in the first place and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer
Yes like your horse who staggering under your boasts would trot more easily if some of them dismounted
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves
Oh will it never be day
I’d say the same thing but I’m afraid I’d be faced out of my way
It’s midnight
I’ll go put my armor on
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning
He wants to eat the English
Swear by her foot so she can stamp out the oath
He’s definitely the most active gentleman of France
Performing is activity and he is always doing that
He never did harm that I heard of
And he’s not going to do any tomorrow
That part of his reputation will stand
I know him to be valiant
I was told that by one who knows him better than you
Who was that
Why he told me so himself and he said he didn’t care who knew it
He doesn’t have to care
His virtue is not hidden
His courage is hidden and when it is revealed it will shrink
Ill will never prompted anything well said
I’ll go straight for that proverb with “To hell with the devil” You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as “A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark” You have overshot
I’ve outshot you and not for the first time
My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents
Who measured the ground
The Lord Grandpré
Poor Harry of England
He doesn’t long for the dawn as we do
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is to blunder with his fat headed followers so far beyond his capacity
If the English had any sense they would run away
If there were anything inside their heads they could never wear such heavy helmets
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures
Their hounds are unequaled in courage
Foolish dogs blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples
You might just as well say “That’s a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion” Yes exactly
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud showy ferocity too leaving their brains behind with their wives
Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils
Yes but these English are seriously short of beef
Then tomorrow we’ll find that they feel only like eating not like fighting
It’s time to put our armor on
Shall we get started
It’s two o'clock now
But let me see by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury
He’s not here
Send for him dear uncle
Shall we call in the ambassador my liege
Not yet cousin
Before I hear him I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time
Thank you I’m sure
My learned lord kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn’t bar me in my claim
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do
them brothers friends and countrymen
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression nor has the long sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color
Gloucester it’s true that we are in great danger
But our courage should only be the greater for that
Good morning brother Bedford
God Almighty there must be some essential goodness even in evil if men would only look for it
In our case our bad neighbors over their make us early risers a healthy and sensible thing to be
Besides they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death
Think like that and you’ll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself
Good morning old Sir Thomas Erpingham
A nice soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France’s hard cold ground
It eases the spirit
And when the mind is engaged the rest of the body dead and dull before wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity like a snake shedding its dead skin
Lend me your cloak Sir Thomas
We shall my liege
Shall I accompany your Grace
No my good knight
Go with my brothers to my English peers
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don’t want any company
The Lord in heaven bless you noble Harry
A friend
Or are you low vulgar and of the common people
I am a gentleman of a company
Do you carry a pike
Exactly
What about you
I’m as good a gentleman as the emperor
Then you’re a better man than the king
The king’s a dear boy with a heart of gold he’s a lively lad a wag born of fine parents good with his fists
I kiss his dirty shoe and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy
What is your name
Harry le Roy
Le Roy
That’s a Cornish name
Are you with a Cornish company
No I am a Welshman
Do you know Fluellen
Yes
Tell him I’ll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy’s Day and slap his head with it
You’d better not wear your dagger in your cap that day or he might slap your head with it
Are you his friend
Yes and his relative too
Thank you
God be with you
My name is Pistol
The name suits your fierceness
Captain Fluellen
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct traditional principles and rules of war
If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great I can tell you that you would find no tittle tattle or pibble pabble in Pompey’s camp
I tell you you would find the rituals of war and I promise you its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise
But the enemy is loud
You can hear them all night long
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot does that mean you think that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot
Think about it
I will lower my voice
Though he seems a little old fashioned there is much care and courage in this Welshman
Brother John Bates isn’t that dawn breaking over there
That’s the beginning of the day we see but I don’t think we’ll see the end of it Who goes there
A friend
What captain do you serve
Sir Thomas Erpingham
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman
Tell me what does he think of our situation
We’re men beached on the sand hoping to be washed out by the next tide
He hasn’t told this to the king has he
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours when they plummet they plummet that much farther
Therefore when he has reason to fear as we do his fears are without question of the same order
Still it stands to reason that he mustn’t betray his fear as it might dishearten his army
He can act as brave as he wants but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck deep in the Thames and I wish he were too and I with him whatever the danger so long as we were far away from here
I’ll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart
I don’t think he wants to be anywhere but where he is
Oh I’m sure you don’t dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel
I don’t think there’s anywhere I’d rather die than in the king’s company as his cause is just and honorable
That’s more than we know
If his cause is wrong our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it
But if the cause is not just the king himself will have a lot to answer for when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying “We died at such and such a place” Some will be swearing some crying for a surgeon some for the wives that are destitute without them some about the debts they owed some for their children left unprovided for
I think few die well who die in battle
The father and the master and the king didn’t order their subordinates' deaths when they ordered their services
Besides there’s no king however pure his cause who if it comes to a trial by combat can rely on using completely blameless soldiers
Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home they cannot escape God
When they feared death they escaped with their lives and now where they imagine they’re safe they perish
So if they die unprepared the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they’re finally being punished for
Every subject’s duty is the king’s but every subject’s soul is his own
Therefore every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do clear his conscience of any stain
Then if he dies his death serves him
It’s clear every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death
The king is not responsible for it
I don’t expect him to answer for me and yet I’m determined to fight vigorously for him
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed
If I live to see it I’ll never trust his word again
Yeah right go get him
That’s a lame threat from a toy gun a poor individual’s private displeasure with a monarch
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather
You’ll “never trust his word again” Come on that was a stupid thing to say
Your scolding is somewhat overblown
I’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed
Let it be a quarrel between us if you live
I’m game
How will I recognize you in the future
Give me some trinket of yours and I will wear it in my hat
Then if you dare to acknowledge it I’ll take up my quarrel with you
Here
I’ll also wear this in my cap
If you come to me after tomorrow and say “That’s my glove” I swear by this hand I will take it and give you a box on the ear
If I ever see it I will challenge you
You may as well undertake to be hanged
I’ll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself
Keep your word
Farewell
Indeed the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they’ll beat us they have such an army
But it’s no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown a head I mean and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping
to wage war
I charge you in the name of God be careful what you say
With this in mind speak my lord
Then hear me gracious sovereign and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne
Upon the king
Let’s lay everything upon the king our lives our souls our debts our anxious wives our children and our sins” I must bear responsibility for all of it
What a painful condition responsibility is
It goes along with being born to greatness but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about
What infinite peace do king’s give up that private men enjoy
What do kings have that private men do not besides the pomp of their position
And what is this useless ceremony of kings
What kind of god is ceremony which suffers more than its worshippers do
What income what profit does it bring in
Oh ceremony only show me your value
Why are you adored
You’re less happy being feared than they are in fearing you
What do you get to drink instead of sweet obedience but poisonous flattery
Try being sick great greatness and see if ceremony can cure you
Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee but can you take possession of his health
No vain illusion so intricately bound up with a king’s rest
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace
My lord your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp
Good old knight gather them all together at my tent
I’ll meet you there
Consider it done my lord
Oh God of battles bolster my soldiers' courage
Don’t let them know fear
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage
And just for today Oh Lord just today don’t think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown
I’ve transferred Richard’s body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood
I’ve hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year
And I’ve built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard’s soul
I will do more though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime asking for pardon
My liege
My brother Gloucester’s voice
I’ll go with you
The day my friends and everything await me
The sun glints off our armor
Awake my lords
Is it time my Lord Constable
Listen to our horses neighing longing to be working
Ha
What you want them to weep our horses' blood
Then how will we see their own natural tears
The English are in the field French lords
To our horses you gallant princes
What’s there to say
Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender
What are you waiting for lords of France
Those island bred skeletons terrified for their bones are an offensive sight on the morning field
The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks torches in their hands
Meanwhile their  They’ve said their prayers and now they wait for death
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them
To the field
I’ll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that
Come let’s be off
The sun is up and we’re wasting the day
Where is the king
The king rode out alone to view their troops
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men
That’s five to one
Besides they’re fresh
May God’s arm strike on our side
These are frightening odds
God be with all of you princes
I’ll go and join my men
Farewell good Salisbury and may good luck go with you
Farewell kind lord
Fight valiantly today
But then I do you wrong to say as much since you are the very embodiment of bravery
He is as full of courage as of kindness princely in both
Oh if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who aren’t working today
Who wishes that
My cousin Westmoreland
No my dear cousin
If we are slated to die the fewer the better for our country and if we’re slated to live the fewer men the greater the share of honor for each of us
In God’s name I beg you not to wish for one more man
By God I am not selfish when it comes to money I don’t care who eats at my expense
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor I am the most guilty soul alive
No my cousin don’t wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead
By God I wouldn’t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me I think not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory
Oh do not wish one more
He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us
He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve saying “Tomorrow is
We’re ready if our minds are ready
Let any man perish who isn’t ready now
You don’t wish we had more help from England anymore cousin
God be with you all
Once more I come to ask you King Harry if you’re ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat
For assuredly you are so near the abyss that you’re bound to be swallowed up
Moreover out of mercy the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where poor wretches their bodies will likely fall and fester
Who sent you this time
The Constable of France
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before
Tell them to capture me then sell my bones
The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him
And on their graves I trust the story of this day’s work will be written in brass
And those who leave their valiant bones in France dying like men though buried in your dunghills they’ll be remembered too
Besides according to the French historians King Pepin who deposed Childeric based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild the daughter of King Clothair
Another case Hugh Capet who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare daughter of Charlemagne who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great) in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though in fact the claim was completely false and worthless)
Another case King Lewis the Tenth who was sole heir to the usurper Capet could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel his grandmother was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France
Thus it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title Hugh Capet’s claim and the resolution of King Lewis’s doubts all plainly derive from the female
Let me speak proudly tell the Constable we’re only workaday soldiers
There’s not a strand of feather left in our whole army a good sign I hope that we won’t fly away like birds and time on the field has made us slovenly
If they do this as they will God willing my ransom will soon be raised
Herald spare yourself
Don’t come again to ask for my ransom good messenger
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine
Tell the constable that
I shall King Harry
And so farewell
You’ll never hear from the herald again
I’m afraid you’ll come to me again for ransom
My lord most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard
Take it brave York
Now soldiers advance
Surrender dog
Is that a lot of      He says his name is Master Fer
Master Fer
What does he say
He begs you to spare his life
He is a gentleman of a good family and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns
Tell him my fury will abate and I’ll take the crowns
Explain boy
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one as he thinks who is the bravest most valorous and thrice worthy gentleman of England
As I get to leech him I will show some mercy
Follow me
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart
I have to stay with the servants who are with our camp’s luggage
We’re sitting ducks for the French if they only knew it for there is no one guarding it but boys
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets mocking us
Do not run away
Our men have all broken ranks
O everlasting shame
Let’s fall on our swords
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for
Is this the king we offered to ransom
Shame eternal shame and nothing but shame
Let us die honorably
He who will not follow me now let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp cap in hand while some slave no nobler than my dog violates his daughter
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us
Let’s go offer up our lives
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order
The hell with order
I’m going back into battle
Let life be short so that shame won’t last too long
The French are still fighting
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects
Is he still alive good uncle
Three times in an hour I saw him down and three times up again and fighting
He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs
By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk York’s comrade and equal in brave wounds
Suffolk died first and York cut to pieces came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face kissing his gashes
He cried out “Wait for me dear cousin
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven
Wait for mine sweet soul
The French have reinforced their scattered men
Then every soldier must kill his prisoners
Spread the word
To this day the kings of France follow this unspoken rule even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim
For it is written in the book of Numbers “When the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter” Gracious lord claim what is yours
Go to the tomb of your great grandfather from whom your own title to the crown derives
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince your great uncle who fought a tragic battle on French soil routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen
O noble English who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces leaving the other half to stand by idle and laughing
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again
You are their heir and sit on their throne and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins
To kill the boys with the luggage
It’s expressly against the rules of combat
It’s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up
There’s certainly not a boy left alive and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle
On top of this they’ve either burned or carried away everything that was in the king’s tent
Oh he’s a gallant king
Yes he was born at Monmouth Captain Gower
And is “pig” not the same as “great” may I ask
The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous they all mean the same thing with some variation
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon
His father was Philip of Macedon as I remember
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born
I tell you Captain if you look at a map of the world I’ll bet you will find comparing Macedon and Monmouth that the situations see are very similar
There is a river in Macedon and there is likewise a river in Monmouth
The river in Monmouth is called Wye but the name of the other river has gone out of my head
Nevertheless it’s all one the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers and there are salmon in both
If you look closely at Alexander’s life Harry of Monmouth’s stands up fairly well by comparison for there are analogies in everything
Alexander God knows and you know in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations and also being a little the worse for drink killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage see
It is not courteous you know to assume you know my meaning before I’ve finished talking
I’m speaking purely in analogies and comparisons
Sir John Falstaff
That’s the one
I tell you there are good men born at Monmouth
Here comes his Majesty
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant
Take a trumpet herald
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill
If they seek battle with us have them come down or else clear the field
The sight of them is offensive
If they’ll do neither we’ll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings
Go and tell them this
Here comes the herald of the French my liege
He looks humbler than he used to
Don’t you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom
Are you coming again for ransom
No great king
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them separating our nobles from the common men for many of our princes alas lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers
Likewise our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes and their wounded steeds ankle deep in gore struggle and raging wildly stamp on their dead masters with their hooves killing them a second time
Oh give us permission great king to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies
You won it
God not our strength be praised
What is the name of the castle that stands over there
Agincourt
Then we’ll call this the Battle of Agincourt fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus
If I may say so your Majesty your famous grandfather and your great uncle Edward the Black Prince of Wales or so I’ve read in the history books fought a very brave battle here in France
They did Fluellen
Your Majesty is quite right
If your Majesties recall it the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which your Majesty knows is to this day a badge of honorable military service
I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy’s Day
I wear it with pride for I am Welsh you know good countryman
Thanks my good countryman
By Jesus I am your Majesty’s countryman and I don’t care who knows it
I will confess it to all the world
I needn’t be ashamed of your Majesty God be praised so long as your Majesty is an honest man
God keep me so Heralds go with him
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides
Soldier you must come to the king
Soldier why are you wearing that glove in your cap
If it pleases your Majesty it is the token of a man I must fight with if he’s still alive
An Englishman
If I may say so your Majesty as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree quite outside of his own sphere
Even if he were as important a man as the devil as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself he’s required see your Grace to keep his vow
If he backs down he’ll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God’s earth in my opinion
Then keep your vow fellow when you meet the man
So I will my liege
Whom do you serve under
Under Captain Gower my liege
Gower is a good captain and is well versed and well read in the wars
Have him come to me here soldier
I will my liege
Here Fluellen stick this in your cap
Your Grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects
Do you know Captain Gower
He is my dear friend your Majesty
Go find him please and bring him to my tent
I’ll fetch him
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester follow Fluellen at a close distance
The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear
According to an agreement I should wear it myself
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them
You come with me uncle of Exeter
I’m sure it is to knight you Captain
As it is God’s will and pleasure Captain I entreat you to come quickly to the king
Sir do you recognize this glove
Know the glove
I know the glove is a glove
Well I recognize this one  Good God
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world or even France or England
Do you think I’d break my oath
Stand aside Captain Gower
I’ll reward treason with blows I promise you
I’m not a traitor
Arrest him he’s a friend of the duke of Alençon’s
My Lord of Warwick a most corrupt treason God be praised for it has been discovered as plain as any you’d hope to see on a summer’s day
Here is his Majesty
My liege this man is a villain and a traitor who see your Grace has struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alençon’s helmet
My liege this was my glove
I met this man with my glove in his cap and I have been as good as my word
Your Majesty see here if it won’t offend your Grace what a complete rascally beggarly lousy rat this is
I hope your Majesty will in all good conscience bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alençon and that your Majesty gave it to me
It was I in fact whom you promised to strike
And so you do
Their bodies may remain here in England but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already
Oh let their bodies follow my dear king to win back what’s rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire
What we have to worry about is a full scale invasion from Scotland always an unreliable neighbor
If it pleases your Majesty let his neck pay the price if there is any martial law in the world
How can you square things with me
You abused me to my face
Your Majesty didn’t present yourself as the king
You represented yourself as just a common man
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine because if you’d been what I took you for there would have been no offense
Therefore I beg your Highness pardon me
I’ll have none of your money
It’s meant in good will
I tell you you can use it to get your shoes fixed
Come why be so hesitant
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape
It’s a good shilling I promise you
Now herald have the dead been counted
Here is the count of the slaughtered French
What prisoners of rank have been taken uncle
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield
Among them are one hundred twenty six princes and standard bearing nobles
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights squires and brave gentlemen five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday
Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries
The rest of the dead are princes barons lords knights squires and gentlemen of birth and rank
Of brave earls Grandpré and Roussi Fauconberg and Foix Beaumont and Marle Vaudemont and Lestrale
Where is the number of our English dead
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other in the ordinary and equal clash of battle
Take credit God for it is no one’s doing but yours
It’s unbelievable
Yes Captain but with this acknowledgement that God fought for us
Yes I truly think He did great good
We’ll perform all the holy rites
As for those who have I beg you to excuse the gaps in time and the many people and things that cannot be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form
Let’s have him land and solemnly proceed to London
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city
He refuses as he is free of vanity and self serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God
Now in the factory of thought create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets
Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry’s return to France
Saint Davy’s Day has passed
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything
We were somewhere where I couldn’t pick a fight with him but I’ve decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again whereupon I’ll give him a little piece of my mind
And here he comes puffing himself up like a turkey
Are you mad
Away
The smell of leek turns my stomach
I wonder if you’d be so good you lousy rotten villain to grant my wish and my request and gratify me see by eating this leek
I’d like you to see because you don’t like it and because it isn’t to your taste and because it doesn’t agree with you
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats
Here’s a goat for you
Dissolute lowlife you shall die
That’s very true mangy rascal when it pleases God
Meanwhile I’d be gratified if you’d live and eat your food
Come here’s some sauce to go with it
Enough Captain
You’ve stunned him
I tell you I’ll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four day head bashing Go on bite
It’s good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin
Must I bite
Yes absolutely no question or ambiguity about it
By this leek I swear I’ll make you pay for this
Would you like some more sauce to go with it
There isn’t enough leek left for you to swear on
Lay off already
Can’t you see I’m eating
I sincerely hope it does you good mangy rascal
No don’t throw any of it away
The skin is good for your cracked head
When you see leeks in the future I hope you keep mocking them
Good
Yes leeks are good
Wait here’s a penny to heal your head
Me a penny
If I owe you anything I’ll pay you in clubbings
You’ll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me
God be with you and keep you and may he heal your head
There’ll be hell to pay for this
Go on get out of here
You’re a lying cowardly wretch
You mock an ancient tradition born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died and then have the gall not to stand by your words
I’ve seen you bait and mock this man more than once
You thought because he didn’t speak English like a native he couldn’t handle an English club
Farewell
Has Fortune turned on me like the whore she is
I’ve had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice
I grow old and all dignity has been thrashed out of me
Well I’ll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing
I’ll steal away to England and I’ll steal some more when I get there
I’ll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars
But here’s an old true saying “If you want to win France start with Scotland” For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and like the mouse when the cat’s away destroy more than she can actually eat
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home
But that is a false conclusion since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands the wise head defends itself at home
We rejoice to see you most worthy brother of England
You are welcome here as are all of you English princes
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship
We’re here to say “amen” to that
All you English princes I salute you
Great kings of France and England I owe you both equal service and loyalty
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I’ve strived mightily with all my wits and energy to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties
Alas she has been too long exiled from France whose crops all lie in heaps rotting with ripeness
Her grapes which make the wine that cheers our hearts die unpruned on the vines
Her once trimmed hedges like prisoners with wild untended hair put forth unruly twigs
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting
The level meadow where the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover once grew has become useless unmowed it grows to seed so that nothing springs up but weeds rough thistles barren plants and burs
children have lost or no longer have time to learn skills that should be a credit to our country
They grow like savages like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood surrounded by swearing and stern looks ragged clothing and everything unnatural
Duke of Burgundy if you want peace the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe you must purchase it buy agreeing across the board to all our very just demands
The king has heard them but as yet has made no answer
Well the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer
I’ve only given the articles a cursory glance
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully I will give my answer and acceptance right away
Fair sister will you go with the princes or stay here with me
Gracious brother I will go with them
Perhaps a woman’s voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up
In that case leave our cousin Katherine here with us
She is our principal demand one of the first points of the treaty
She is welcome to stay
Lovely most lovely Katherine will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love suit to a gentle heart like yours
Your Majesty shall mock at me
I cannot speak your England
Lovely Katherine if you will love me well with your French heart I’m happy to hear you confess it in broken English
Do you like me Kate
Pardon me but I do not know what is “like me” An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel
I said so dear Katherine and I’m not ashamed to repeat it
Kate my wooing is fit for your understanding I am glad your English isn’t better
If it were you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I’d sold my farm to buy my crown
I don’t know any fancy ways of talking about love only to say right out “I love you” If you press me any further than with the question “Do you really” my love scene is over
So give me your answer and we’ll shake on it
Deal
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other though I have the gift of strength
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back though you may accuse me of boasting I could easily get myself a wife
If you can love a man of this temperament Kate whose face a sunburn wouldn’t make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself let your eye improve me
I speak to you as a plain soldier
If you can love me for this take me
If not to tell you I will die is true but not for love by God
And yet I do love you
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady’s good graces always reason themselves out again
If you would have such a man take me
So what do you say to my suit
Speak my fair one and speak fairly I beg you
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France
No it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate
But in loving me you would love the friend of France for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it
I will have it all mine
And Kate when France is mine and I am yours then France is yours and you are mine
I don’t understand all dat
No Kate
Can any of your neighbors tell Kate
I’ll ask them
But mock me gently dear Kate because I love you terribly
Shall we not
What do you say my fair  I do not know dat
No of course you don’t
Now there can only be the promise
Do promise Kate that you’ll do your French part to bring forth such a boy and for my English half take the word of a king and a bachelor
I tell you truly in true English I love you Kate
And though I wouldn’t dare to swear that you love me still my blood begins to flatter me that you do despite the ill effects of my face
Curse my father’s ambition
But I promise you Kate the older I grow the better I’ll look
My comfort is that old age that poor preserver of beauty can’t make my face any worse than it already is
If you have me you have me now at my worst and if you have me you’ll appreciate me better and better
Therefore tell me fairest Katherine will you have me
Take me by the hand and say “Harry of England I am yours” No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out “England is yours Ireland is yours France is yours and Harry Plantagenet
is yours” And though I say so in his presence if he’s not a friend of the best kings you’ll find him king of the best friends
Come on tell me in broken music for your voice is music and your English broken
Come Katherine Queen of All reveal your heart to me in broken English
Will you have me
Den it shall also content me
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen
Then I will kiss your lips Kate
What does she say madam interpreter
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France I cannot tell vat is  To kiss
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married is that what she says
Oh Kate prudish customs bow before great kings
You and I cannot be held within the confines of a country’s arbitrary customs dear Kate
You and I Kate we are the makers of custom and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss
Therefore willingly and yielding
God save your Majesty
My royal kinsman are you teaching our princess English
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her kinsman and that’s good English
She picks it up quick doesn’t she
So possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery I can’t awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness
From this I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end just as many arrows shot from different points converge on a single target just as many roads meet in a single town just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea just as the many radiuses of a
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic
For love to appear in his true likeness he would have to be as Cupid is naked and blind
How can you blame her a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes for objecting to having a blind naked boy appear before her
It’s a lot to ask of a maiden
They’re forgiven then if they don’t see what they’re doing
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes my lord
So you’re telling me to give it time and wait for summer
And even then in order for me to catch the fly your cousin she must be blind
Like love my lord before it learns to love
Fair enough
Shall Kate be my wife
If you wish
I am satisfied as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her
That way the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire
We have consented to all reasonable terms
Is that true my lords of England
The king has agreed to every point first his daughter then everything else as you strictly proposed
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title in French  And even this I’m willing to grant if you request it
In that case I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest and bestow your daughter on me
Amen
Now welcome Kate And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen
May God who is the best matchmaker join your hearts and realms in one
God say “Amen”
Amen
Let us prepare for our wedding On that day I’ll take your oath of loyalty my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers to guarantee my treaty
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude inadequate writing keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history’s full glory with his uneven telling
Henry the Sixth crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy succeeded him
With those plays in mind we hope you’ll receive this one kindly
If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin
I’m ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him not the king
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we’ve been asked to convey
Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections
Divide each man into a thousand and there you will have an imaginary army
Imagine when we talk of horses that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth
I am no tyrant but a Christian king whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons
Therefore tell me the Dauphin’s mind frankly and without constraint
You can’t party your way into dukedoms there
And in return for this gift he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms
This is the Dauphin’s message
What’s the treasure uncle
Tennis balls my liege
I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor
Thank you for his present and your trouble
Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls I’ll play a set in France God willing that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home
So go in peace
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it
That was a humorous message
I hope to make the sender blush for it
Now lords don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition
Therefore let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet
shifts friends to Southampton
From there we’ll safely carry you to France and back calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage
But we won’t shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears
Good to see you Corporal Nym
Good day Lieutenant Bardolph
Tell me are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet
For my part I really don’t care
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France
How about it Corporal Nym
That’s it
It’s not for me to say
Things are what they are
Men may sleep and when they do they may have their throats with them and some people say knives have blades
There must be some resolution
Well it’s not for me to say
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife
I swear I scorn the word
Oh dear
Pish
Pish to you you mangy dog you pointy eared Icelandic mutt
Corporal Nym be a man and put away your sword
Get lost will you
I am not some fiend of hell you can’t get rid of me with spells
I’m in a mood to beat you up pretty good
If you get nasty with me Pistol I’ll stab you with my sword in fair play
Your grave is gaping open and your death is near
So take your last breath
Listen listen to what I say whoever strikes first I’ll run him through with my sword as sure as I’m a soldier
That’s an oath of great power and our fury must subside
That’s enough
I swear he’ll be food for the crows soon
The king has broken his heart
Good husband come home soon
Come on can I get you two to make up
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet
Paying debts is for peasants
I’m going to take it from you now
We’ll see won’t we
Do your best
By this sword I’ll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust
By this sword I will
By this sword” is an oath and oaths must be kept
Come on put it away
In cash
Well then that’s how it is
If you ever had a mother come in quickly to Sir John
The poor thing he is so shaken with a fever that it’s terrible to see
Sweet men come to him
And as the speaker of any prologue should I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly
Nym what you say is true
He has his moods and his ways
How smooth and cool they seem
Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful
The king has been informed of all their plans but they have no idea
Now that the wind is favorable let’s board the ship
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you my noble knight what do you think
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France achieving and accomplishing everything I’ve assembled them to do
No doubt it will my liege if each man does his best
I have no doubt about that since I know there isn’t a man among us who isn’t with me wholeheartedly or a soul left behind who doesn’t wish us success and conquest
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself your Majesty
I don’t think there’s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government
True
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness serving you loyally and wholeheartedly
Yes I have great cause to be thankful
Uncle of Exeter release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me
That’s merciful but a bit careless
Oh let us be merciful anyway
And now let’s turn to our business with the French
Who are the new commissioners
I am one my lord
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today
You told me to do the same my liege
And me too my royal sovereign
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness’s mercy
To which we all appeal
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white I can scarcely believe it it’s so past understanding
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive put together from shreds
and patches of righteousness
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s” How you have poisoned my faith in people
Why so did you
Why so did you
Do they come from good families
Why so did you
Do they seem religious
Why so did you
That’s how sound a man you appeared
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion
This treachery of yours is like the second
Richard Earl of Cambridge I arrest you for high treason
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham I arrest you for high treason
Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland I arrest you for high treason
I regret my crime more than my death and I beg your Highness to forgive me while punishing my body with death
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme and I rejoice in paying the penalty as I beg God and you to pardon me
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking
Pardon my crime sovereign but not my person
May God in His mercy forgive you
I seek no revenge for myself but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom which you sought to destroy that you must be punished according to her laws
So go to your deaths poor miserable wretches the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot
I’m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed
Let’s go forth dear countrymen
I’ll be no king of England if I’m not also king of France
No because my manly heart is grieving
Bardolph be happy Nym rouse your bragging spirits Boy be brave
Oh no he’s surely not in hell
He’s in  They say he cried out against sherry
Yes he did
And women
No he did not
He could never bear carnation
It was a color he never did like
He once said the devil would get him because of women
He did touch on women a bit but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon
Don’t you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph’s nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell
Well the  Shall we get moving
The king will already have left Southampton
Look after my goods and possessions
My lord this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign
Everyone thought it would pass then and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time which required the matter to be put off
But how will we keep it from being passed now my lord
We have to think about that
If it does pass the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand two hundred squires and a hundred well supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers old age pensioners the poor and those too weak or sick to work
That’s what the bill says
But what can be done to prevent it
The king is virtuous and kind
And a true lover of the holy Church
I’ve heard that’s not the most nourishing food
Kiss her soft mouth and we’ll be off
Farewell hostess
Be thrifty
And keep yourself hidden I command you
Farewell
Adieu
Therefore the dukes of Berri Bretagne Brabant and Orléans shall advance and you Prince Dauphin will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves
The king of England’s approach is as forceful as a whirlpool
Let’s do it with no show of anxiety no with no more fear than if we’d heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing
Because my good king England is so poorly led her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain silly shallow impulsive youth that she’s hardly a threat
Oh please Prince Dauphin
You are completely wrong about this king
Talk to the ambassadors who’ve just come back ask them how majestically he responded to their message how well supplied he was with good advisors how restrained in expressing his displeasure and moreover how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve
You’ll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that  Well you’re wrong my Lord High Constable
But even if I thought you were right it doesn’t matter
When it comes to defense it’s best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems
crowned by the golden sun observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years since they were babies
This king is a branch of that same victorious stock
Ambassadors of Harry king of England request a hearing with your Majesty
We’ll see them immediately
Bring them right in
My good King surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over
Self love my liege is not so great a sin as self neglect
From our brother monarch the king of England
And what will happen if I don’t
Bloodshed will force you to
I’ll think it over
Tomorrow I’ll let you know what I’ve decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England
Regarding the Dauphin you can speak to me
What’s the message from the English king
Scorn and defiance indifference contempt and any insult that wouldn’t disgrace the mighty sender that’s the value he puts on you
And my king goes on if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands Henry’s artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face
To that end I presented him with the tennis balls the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity
He’ll make your palace tremble for this insult even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe
And make no mistake you’ll find as we his subjects have an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now
We’ll give you an answer tomorrow
Don’t take too long unless you want our king to come after me to ask what’s holding things up because he’s already landed here
You’ll have your answer soon
A night isn’t much time for addressing matters of this importance
And so on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought our scene flies swiftly on
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging
Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub
Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea breasting the high waves
Pretend that you’re standing on the shore watching a city dance on the shifting waves and you’ll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur
Follow it follow it
Once there make your thoughts work harder and witness a siege
Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur
Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
his daughter Katherine with some insignificant unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry
Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings
Attack the breach in the city wall once more dear friends attack it once more or else let’s close it up with English corpses
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare
On on you noblest Englishmen descended as you are from battle tested fathers fathers who like so many Alexander the Greats have fought in these regions from morning until night sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight
Don’t dishonor your mothers
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you
And you good farmers whose limbs were made in England show us here the vigor of your upbringing
Prove you are worthy of your birth which I do not doubt for a moment
We are fortunate in the change
Listen to him talk about war and you’ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles
Follow your spirit and as you charge cry “God for Harry England and Saint George”
On on on on on
To the breach to the breach
Please corporal stop
You can see how it is all around
I wish I were in an alehouse in London
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety
Me too
Up to the breach you dogs
Go
Great Duke be merciful to mortal men
Dear man calm your rage
Be lenient dearest
This is healthy talk
Your Honor’s is unhealthy talk
Young though I am I’ve been observing these three blowhards closely
Yet not one among them if all three were to wait on me could be my “man” because three such fakes don’t amount to a man
They will steal anything and call it spoils
They would like me to be as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs which goes against my manhood because to take something from another’s pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing
I must leave them and seek some better employment
Their villainy nauseates me and I must therefore vomit it up
The tunnels
For the enemy see and you can explain this to the duke see has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours
By Jesus I think they will blow up everything if we don’t improve our tactics
The duke of Gloucester who has command over the siege is in consultation with an Irishman a very valiant gentleman indeed
It’s Captain Macmorris right
I think so
Jesus he’s an ass if there ever was one
I will say as much to his face
He knows no more about the proper practice of war see the ancient practices than a puppy
Here he comes with Captain Jamy the Scots captain
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman that’s certain one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare I happen to know from his maneuvers
By Jesus he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world
Good day to you Captain Fluellen
Good evening to your Worship good Captain James
Tell me Captain Macmorris have you left the tunnels
Have the excavators stopped work
Christ it’s a disaster
I swear by this hand and my father’s soul the whole thing is a disaster
It’s all stopped
I could have blown up the town in an hour
Oh it’s a disaster a disaster by this hand it’s a disaster
Captain Macmorris I beg your pardon but would you grant me a discussion or two with you see partly touching on or concerning the practice of war the Roman wars for the sake of argument see and friendly conversation
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction see of my mind with respect to the demands of proper military practice that’s the point
What endeavor Popillius
Good luck
Look he’s approaching Caesar
Keep an eye on him
Brutus what will we do
If our secret’s known either Caesar or I will die for I’ll kill myself
Cassius stand firm
Trebonius knows his cue
Where’s Metellus Cimber
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now
They’re speaking to him
Go up there and second his petition
Casca you’ll be the first to raise your hand
Are we all ready
I have to stop you Cimber
These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men flattering them into turning Roman law into children’s games
What even you Brutus
I could be convinced if I were like you
If I could beg others to change their minds begging would convince me too
But I’m as immovable as the northern star whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky
The sky shows countless stars
So it is on earth
To show you that that’s me let me prove it a little even in this case
Enough
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus
Haven’t I resisted even Brutus begging from his knees
Hands speak for me
Liberty
Freedom
Tyranny is dead
Run and proclaim it in the streets
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out “Liberty freedom and democracy” People and senators don’t be afraid
Don’t run away stay where you are
Go to the platform Brutus
And Cassius too
Where’s Publius
Stand close together in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to  Don’t talk about standing together Publius cheer up
We don’t intend any harm to you nor to anyone else
Tell them this Publius
And leave us Publius in case the people storming us should harm you
Do so
And let no one suffer for this deed except us the perpetrators
Where’s Antony
He ran to his house stunned
Men wives and children stare cry out and run in the streets as though it were doomsday
Why the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death
Kneel Romans kneel and let’s wash our hands up to the elbows in Caesar’s blood and smear it on our swords
Then we’ll go out even to the marketplace and waving our bloody swords over our heads let’s cry “Peace freedom and liberty” Kneel then and wash
Who’s calling me
Quiet everyone
Quiet
Who in the crowd is calling me
I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling “Caesar” Speak
Caesar is listening
Beware of March 15th
Who’s that
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th
Bring him in front of me
Let me see his face
You fellow step out of the crowd
This is Caesar you’re looking at
What do you have to say to me now
Speak once again
Beware of March 15th
He’s insane
Let’s leave him
Let’s move
Are you going to watch the race
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show though he now lies at the base of Pompey’s statue as worthless as dust
Yes every man forward
Brutus will lead and we’ll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome
Wait a minute
Who’s that coming
It’s a friend of Antony’s
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman
I never thought any less of him
Tell him if he comes here I’ll explain everything to him and on my word he’ll leave unharmed
I know that he’ll be on our side
But here comes Antony Welcome Mark Antony
Oh mighty Caesar
Do you lie so low
Have all your conquests glories triumphs achievements come to so little
Farewell
Gentlemen I don’t know what you intend to do who else you intend to kill who else you consider corrupt
If it’s me there’s no time as good as this hour of Caesar’s death and no weapon better than your swords covered with the noblest blood in the world
I ask you if you have a grudge against me to kill me now while your stained hands still reek of blood
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn’t be as ready to die as I am now
There’s no place I’d rather die than here by Caesar and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you the masters of this new era
Oh Antony don’t beg us to kill you
They are full of pity for Caesar
But a stronger pity for the wrongs committed against Rome drove out our pity for Caesar as fire drives out fire and so we killed him
For you our swords have blunt edges too dull to harm you Mark Antony
Our arms which can be strong and cruel and our hearts filled with brotherly love embrace you with kind love good thoughts and reverence
Your vote will be as strong as anyone’s in the reordering of the government
But just be patient until we’ve calmed the masses who are beside themselves with fear
I don’t doubt your wisdom
Each of you give me your bloody hand
Mark Antony  Pardon me Caius Cassius
I took your hands in friendship but indeed I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar
I am friends with you all and love you all on one condition that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you Antony were Caesar’s son you would be satisfied with them
You may Mark Antony
Brutus may I have a word with you
It’ll help us more than hurt us
Mark Antony take Caesar’s body
You will not blame us in your funeral speech but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission
And you’ll speak on the same platform as I do after I’m done
So be it
I don’t want anything more
Prepare the body then and follow us
You are what’s left of the noblest man that ever lived
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood
Over your wounds which like speechless mouths open their red lips as though to beg me to speak I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy
I do Mark Antony
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome
He received Caesar’s letters and he is coming
Grief seems to be contagious for my eyes seeing the tears in yours began to fill
Is your master coming
He rests tonight within twenty one miles of Rome
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened
Don’t go back until I’ve carried the corpse into the marketplace
Help me here
We want answers
Give us answers
Then follow me and listen to my speech friends
Cassius go to the next street and divide the crowd
Let those who will hear me speak stay
Lead those away who will follow you and we’ll explain publicly the reasons for Caesar’s death
I’ll listen to Brutus
I’ll listen to Cassius and we will compare their reasons
Noble Brutus has mounted the platform
Be patient until I finish
Romans countrymen and friends
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind so you may believe me
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly
If there’s anyone in this assembly any dear friend of Caesar’s I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his
If then that friend demands to know why I rose up against Caesar this is my answer it’s not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men
I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me
I rejoice in his good fortune
I honor him for being brave
But his ambition for that I killed him
There are tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his bravery and death for his ambition
Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave
If there are any speak for it is he whom I’ve offended
Who here is so barbarous that he doesn’t want to be a Roman
If there are any speak for it is he whom I’ve offended
Who here is so vile that he doesn’t love his country
If there are any speak for it is he whom I have offended
I will pause for a reply
No one Brutus no one
Then I have offended no one
I’ve done no more to Caesar than you will do to me
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated
Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had no part in the killing will benefit from his death receiving a share in the commonwealth as you all will
Live Brutus
Live live
Let’s carry him in triumph to his house
I don’t like sports
I’m not competitive like Antony
But don’t let me keep you from going Cassius
I’ll go my own way
Cassius don’t take it badly
Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
Let him become Caesar
Caesar’s better qualities exist in Brutus and we will crown him
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration
My countrymen  Silence
Brutus speaks
Quiet there
Good countrymen let me leave alone
I ask that none of you leave except myself until Antony has finished
Let him mount the pulpit
We’ll listen to him
For Brutus’s sake I am indebted to you
What does he say about Brutus
He says that for Brutus’s sake he finds himself indebted to us all
He’d better not speak badly of Brutus here
Caesar was a tyrant
That’s for sure
We’re lucky that Rome is rid of him
Quiet
Let’s hear what Antony has to say
You gentle Romans  Quiet there
Let us hear him
Friends Romans countrymen give me your attention
I have come here to bury Caesar not to praise him
The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths but the good is often buried with them
It might as well be the same with Caesar
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious
If that’s true it’s a serious fault and Caesar has paid seriously for it
With the permission of Brutus and the others for Brutus is an honorable man they are all honorable men I have come here to speak at Caesar’s funeral
He was my friend he was faithful and just to me
But Brutus says he was ambitious and Brutus is an honorable man
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city
Is this the work of an ambitious man
When the poor cried Caesar cried too
Ambition shouldn’t be so soft
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious and Brutus is an honorable man
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king’s crown three times and he refused it three times
Was this ambition
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said but to say what  I think there’s a lot of sense in what he says
If you think about it correctly Caesar has suffered a great wrong
Has he sirs
Caesar wouldn’t take the crown
Therefore it’s certain that he wasn’t ambitious
If it turns out he wasn’t certain people are going to get it
Poor man
Antony’s eyes are fiery red from crying
There isn’t a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world
Now he lies there worth nothing and no one is so humble as to show him respect
Oh sirs if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage I would offend Brutus and Cassius who you all know are honorable men
I will not do them wrong
I would rather wrong the dead and wrong myself and you than wrong such honorable men
But here’s a paper with Caesar’s seal on it
If you could only hear this testament which excuse me I don’t intend to read aloud you would kiss dead Caesar’s wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by
We want to hear the will
Read it Mark Antony
The will the will
We want to hear Caesar’s will
It isn’t proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you
You aren’t wood you aren’t stones you’re men
And being men the contents of Caesar’s will would enrage you
Read the will
We want to hear it Antony
You have to read us the will Caesar’s will
Will you be patient
Will you wait awhile
I’ve said too much in telling you of it
I’m afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar
They were traitors
The testament
They were villains murderers
The will
Read the will
You force me to read the will then
Then make a circle around Caesar’s corpse and let me show you the man who made this will
Shall I come down
Will you let me
Come down
Descend
We’ll let you
Stand away from the hearse
Stand away from the body
Make room for Antony most noble Antony
No don’t press up against me
Stand further away
Stand back
Give him room
If you have tears prepare to shed them now
You all know this cloak
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors
Look here’s where Cassius’s dagger pierced it
See the wound that Casca made
For Brutus as you know was Caesar’s angel
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him
This was the most unkind cut of all
And at the base of Pompey’s statue with his cloak covering his face which was dripping with blood the whole time great Caesar fell
Oh what a fall it was my countrymen
Then you and I and all of us fell down while bloody treason triumphed
Oh now you weep and I sense that you feel pity
These are gracious tears
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak how will you feel kind men now
Look at this here is the man scarred as you can see by traitors
Oh what a sad sight
Oh noble Caesar
Oh sad day
Oh traitors villains
Oh most bloody sight
Revenge
Seek
Burn
Set fire
Kill
Slay
Wait countrymen
Quiet there
Listen to the noble Antony
Those who have done this deed are honorable
I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it
They’re wise and honorable and will no doubt give you reasons for it
I haven’t come to steal your loyalty friends
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up
I just speak directly
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me then I’d stir you up and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny
We’ll mutiny
We’ll burn Brutus’s house
Let’s go then
Come find the conspirators
Wait and listen to me countrymen
Quiet
Wait
Listen to Antony
Most noble Antony
Why friends you don’t even know what you’re doing yet
What has Caesar done to deserve your love
Alas you don’t know
I must tell you then
You’ve forgotten the will I told you about
Yes
The will
Let’s stay and hear the will
Most noble Caesar
We’ll revenge his death
Oh royal Caesar
Listen to me patiently
Quiet there
Also he’s left you all his walkways in his private gardens and newly planted orchards on this side of the Tiber River
He’s left them to you and to your heirs forever public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax
Here was a Caesar
When will there be another like him
We’ll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors' houses on fire
Take up the body
We’ll start a fire
Now let it work
What’s up my man
Sir Octavius has already arrived in Rome
Where is he
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house
I will go straight to visit him
I ask for him and he comes
Fortune is happy today and in this mood will give us anything we want
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people
Take me to Octavius
That’s true
And it’s too bad Brutus that you don’t have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself
I’ve heard many of the noblest Romans next to immortal Caesar speaking of you complaining of the tyranny of today’s government and wishing that your eyes were working better
What dangers are you trying to lead me into Cassius that you want me to look inside myself for something that’s not there
I’ll tell you good Brutus
And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection I’ll be your mirror and show you without exaggeration things inside you that you can’t see
And don’t be suspicious of me noble Brutus
If I were your average fool or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody or if you’d seen me first flattering men hugging them tightly and later slandering them behind their backs or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble only then of course go ahead and assume I’m dangerous
Why are they shouting
I’m afraid the people have made Caesar their king
Really are you afraid of that
Then I have to assume you don’t want him to be king
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination
I have no desire to go outside yet something leads me there
What’s your name
Where are you going
Where do you live
Are you a married man or a bachelor
Answer all of us now
Yes and be brief
Yes and be wise
What’s my name
Where am I going
Where do I live
Am I a married man or a bachelor
Then to answer every man briefly wisely and truthfully wisely I say I am a bachelor
You imply that married men are fools
You’ll get a blow from me for that I think
Right this instant I’m going to Caesar’s funeral
As a friend or an enemy
As a friend
Getting right to the point I live near the Capitol
Tell us your name sir truthfully
Truthfully my name is Cinna
Tear him to pieces
He’s a conspirator
I’m not Cinna the conspirator
It doesn’t matter
His name’s Cinna
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go
Tear him apart tear him up
Come firebrands over here
To Brutus’s to Cassius’s let’s burn them all
Some of you go to Decius’s house and some to Casca’s
Some to Ligarius’s
Go
These ones then will be assassinated
Their names are marked
I agree  Put a mark next to his name too Antony
On the condition that your sister’s son Publius also must die Mark Antony
He will die
See I’ve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name
But Lepidus go to Caesar’s house
Bring his will here and we’ll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people
Will you be here when I return
Either here or at the Capitol
He’s an unremarkable man fit only to be sent on errands
Does it really make sense once we divide the world into three parts that he should be one of the three rulers
Octavius I’m older than you are
And although we’re giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we’re doing he’ll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold groaning and sweating under the load either led or pushed as we direct him
Once he’s carried our treasure where we want it we’ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures
You can do what you want but he’s an experienced and honorable soldier
So is my horse Octavius and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants
Stop
Pass on the command to halt
What’s happening now Lucillius
Is Cassius nearby
He’s nearby and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master
If he’s nearby I want an explanation
Can I have a word with you Lucillius
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect but not with affection nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me
You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off
Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony
But insincere men like horses who are too lively at the start of a race make a big show of their spirit
But when push comes to shove they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl
Is his army approaching
They plan to spend the night in Sardis
The larger part the main body of cavalry are coming with Cassius
Look
He’s arrived
March to meet him at a dignified pace
Halt
Halt
Pass the order along
Halt
Halt
Halt
Most noble brother you have done me wrong
Let the gods judge me
Do I mistreat even my enemies
And when you do  Cassius calm down
Let’s not argue here in front of both our armies which ought to see nothing but love between us
Order them to move back
Then in my tent you can elaborate on your complaints and I’ll listen
Pindarus order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians and you ignored my letters where I argued that he was innocent I know the man
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man
In a time like this it doesn’t make sense to criticize every offense
I’ll tell you Cassius you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold
Me “greedy”
You know if you were anyone other than Brutus that speech would be your last
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions and so they go unpunished
Unpunished
Remember March March 15th
Didn’t great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on
I’d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman
Brutus do not provoke me
I will not take it
You’re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner
I’m a soldier more experienced than you and better able to give orders
Get lost
You are not Cassius
I am
I say you’re not
Don’t provoke me any further or I’ll forget to restrain myself
If you care about your health you won’t push me any further
Leave you little man
Is this possible
Listen to me for I have something to tell you
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me
But why do you keep me here so long
What do you want to tell me
I know this quality in you Brutus it’s as familiar to me as your face
Indeed honor is what I want to talk to you about
I don’t know what you and other men think of this life but as for me I’d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself
I was born as free as Caesar
So were you
We both have eaten as well and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he
Once on a cold and windy day when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks Caesar said to me “Cassius I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there” As soon as he spoke though I was fully dressed I plunged in and called for him to follow
And he did
But before we reached the end point Caesar cried “Help me Cassius or I will sink” And just as Aeneas the hero who founded Rome emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar
All this”
Yes and more
Go ahead rage till your proud heart breaks
Show your slaves how mad you are and make your servants tremble
Has it come to this
You say you’re a better soldier
Show it
Make your boasts come true and I’ll be thrilled
I’m always happy to hear about brave men
You wrong me in every way
You wrong me Brutus
When Caesar was alive even he wouldn’t dare anger me like this
Oh be quiet
You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so
I wouldn’t have dared
No
You wouldn’t have dared out of fear for your life
Don’t take my love for granted
I might do something I’ll be sorry for
You’ve already done something you should be sorry for
Your threats don’t scare me Cassius because I’m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers and you wouldn’t give it to me
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew
And would I have ever done that to you
I didn’t refuse you
You did
I didn’t
The man who brought my answer to you was a fool
You have broken my heart
A friend should put up with his friend’s weaknesses but you exaggerate mine
I don’t until you practice them on me
You don’t love me
I don’t like your faults
A friend would never see those faults
No a flatterer wouldn’t even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus
Oh I could weep my soul right out of myself
There’s my dagger  Put away your dagger
Be angry whenever you like it’s all right with me
Do whatever you want and I’ll say your insults are just a bad mood
When I said that I was angry too
You admit it then
Give me your hand
And my heart too
Oh Brutus
What’s the matter
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper which I inherited from my mother makes me forget how I should behave
Yes Cassius
And from now on when you get hot with me I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it at that
What’s this
What’s the matter
You should be ashamed generals
What do you think you’re doing
Love each other and be friends like two such men should be
Listen to me because I’m older than you surely
Be patient with him Brutus
That’s just how he is
I’ll humor him when he learns how to behave
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post
Get out of here my friend
Away away be gone
Lucillius and Titinius order the commanders to have the men camp for the night
And return to us immediately bringing Messala with you
I didn’t think you could even be so angry
Oh Cassius I’m tired out by many sorrows
Portia is dead
Portia
She is dead
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss
What sickness did she die of
She was worried about my absence and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong which I found out at the same time as the news of her death
And that’s how she died
Yes like that
Oh immortal gods
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise
Fill my cup Lucius until the wine overflows it
I cannot drink too much of Brutus’s love
Now let’s sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs
Portia are you really gone
No more about that please
Messala I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power
I have received letters that say the same
And anything else
That with a series of legal writs Octavius Antony and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death
On that point our letters don’t agree
My letters say only seventy senators were killed one being Cicero
Cicero too
Cicero is dead by their decree
No Messala
And you haven’t heard any news about her in your letters
Nothing Messala
I think that’s strange
Why do you ask
Have you heard something of her in your letters
No my lord
Now as you’re a Roman tell me the truth
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman
It’s certain that she is dead and she died in a strange way
Well good bye Portia
We all must die Messala
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime I can endure her death now
That’s the way great men ought to endure great losses
I’ve practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you but I still couldn’t bear this news like you do
Well let’s move on to our work with the living
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately
I don’t think it’s a good idea
Why not
Here’s why it’d be better for the enemy to come after us
That way he’ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers weakening his own capacities while we lying still are rested energetic and nimble
If we meet him at Philippi these people will be at our backs
Listen to me good brother
Our regiments are full to the brim our cause is ready
The enemy gets larger each day
We now at our largest can only decrease
It’s on such a high tide that we’re now floating and we must take the current when it is offered or lose our campaign
If that’s what you want all right
We’ll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi
It’s now late at night and actions must accommodate bodily needs which we’ll satisfy with only a short rest
That’s all there is to say
There’s nothing else
Good night
We’ll rise and leave early tomorrow
Lucius
Let’s pray that we never come into conflict like that again
Let’s not Brutus
And this is the man who has now become a god and I’m a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way
In Spain Caesar had a fever and it made him shake
It’s true this so called “god” he shook
His cowardly lips turned white and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam
I heard him groan yes I did and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried “Give me some water Titinius” like a sick girl
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone
More shouting
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar
Why Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably as slaves
Men can be masters of their fate
It is not destiny’s fault but our own faults that we’re slaves
Brutus” and “Caesar” What’s so special about “Caesar”
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours
Write them together yours is just as good a name
Pronounce them it is just as nice to say
Everything’s fine
Good night my lord
Good night good brother
Good night Lord Brutus
Farewell everyone
Give me the gown
Where’s your lute
Here in the tent
What are you sleepy
Call Claudio and some of my other men
I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent
Varrus and Claudio
Did you call my lord
Sirs I ask you to sleep in my tent
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius
If you like we’ll stand by and wait to do whatever you need
Look Lucius here’s the book I was searching for
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown
I was sure that you hadn’t given it to me
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute
Yes my lord if you would like
I would my boy
I ask too much of you but you’re always willing
It’s my duty sir
I shouldn’t make you do more than you’re able
I know that young men look forward to their rest
I’ve already slept my lord
That was good planning and you’ll sleep some more
I won’t keep you very long
If I live through this I’ll be good to you
This is a sleepy tune
Gentle boy good night
I won’t trouble you so much as to wake you
Good night good boy
Let me see let me see
Didn’t I turn down the page where I left off reading
Here it is I think
I think it’s my bad eyesight that’s making me see this horrible vision
It’s coming toward me
Are you a god an angel or a devil that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up
Tell me what you are
I’m your evil spirit Brutus
Why do you come here
To tell you that you’ll see me at Philippi
Then I’ll see you again
Yes at Philippi
Alright then I’ll see you at Philippi
Evil spirit I want to talk some more
Claudio
Claudio
He thinks he’s still playing his instrument
Lucius wake up
My lord
Were you dreaming Lucius
My lord I don’t think I cried out
Yes you did
Did you see anything
Nothing my lord
My lord
My lord
Why did you cry out in your sleep
Did we my lord
Yes
Did you see anything
No my lord I didn’t see anything
Me neither my lord
Go to my brother Cassius
Order him to advance his forces first thing and we’ll follow
Yes my lord
Now Antony our prayers have been answered
You said the enemy wouldn’t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions
It seems not
Their forces are nearby
They intend to challenge us here at Philippi responding to our challenge before we’ve even challenged him
I know how they think and I understand why they’re doing this
They really wish they were somewhere else but they want to descend on us looking fierce so we’ll think they’re brave
But they aren’t
Prepare yourselves generals
The enemy approaches with great display
They show their bloody heralds of battle and something must be done immediately
Octavius lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field
I’ll go to the right side
You stay on the left
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter
They want to talk
Stay here Titinius
We have to go out and talk to them
Mark Antony should we give the signal to attack
No Octavius Caesar we’ll respond to their charge
Go forward
The generals want to speak with us
Words before fighting
Is that how it is countrymen
Not that we love words more than fighting like you do
Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
Brutus you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes
But your words are as sweet as honey you’ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing
I took their stings too wouldn’t you say
Villains you didn’t do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar’s sides
Now Brutus you have only yourself to thank
Come come let’s remember why we’re here
If arguing makes us sweat the real trial will turn that water to blood
Caesar you’re not going to be killed by a traitor unless you kill yourself
I hope you’re right
I wasn’t born to die on your sword
If you were the noblest of your family young man you couldn’t die more honorably
An annoying schoolboy unworthy of such an honor joined by a masquerader and a partier
Still the same old Cassius
If you dare to fight today come to the field
If not come when you have the courage
Now let the wind blow waves swell and ships sink
The storm has begun and everything is at stake
Messala
Messala today is my birthday I was born on this very day
Give me your hand Messala
You’ll be my witness that I’ve been forced as Pompey was to wager all of our freedoms on one battle
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens
I’ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens
Traveling from Sardis two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there eating from the hands of the soldiers who’d accompanied us to Philippi
This morning they’ve flown away and in their place are ravens crows and kites flying over our heads and looking down on us as though we were sickly prey
Their shadows are like a deadly canopy under which our army lies ready to die
Don’t believe in this
I only partly believe it for I’m enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering
Now most noble Brutus the gods are friendly with us today so that we who want peace can live on to old age
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain let’s think about the worst that may happen
If we lose this battle this is the last time we’ll speak to each other
If we lose what do you plan to do
Cast spells with them and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar” Now in the name of all the gods I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great
Our era should be ashamed
Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men
When was there ever an age since the beginning of time that didn’t feature more than one famous man
Until now no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome
Now though in all of Rome there’s room for only one man
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus your ancestor who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule
I have no doubt that you love me
I’m beginning to understand what you want me to do
What I think about this and about what’s happening here in Rome I’ll tell you later
For now don’t try to persuade me anymore I ask you as a friend
I’ll think over what you’ve said I’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say and I’ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters
Until then my noble friend think about this I’d rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through
I’m glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you
Then if we lose this battle you’ll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome
No Cassius no
Don’t imagine that I’ll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains
My mind is too great for that
Therefore accept my everlasting farewell
Forever and forever farewell Cassius
If we meet again then we’ll smile
If not then this parting was well done
Forever and forever farewell Brutus
If we meet again then we’ll smile indeed
If not it’s true this parting was well done
Well lead on
Oh I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens
But it’s enough to know that the day will end and then the end will be known
Let’s go
Ride ride Messala ride and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side
They should advance immediately because I sense Octavius’s side is a bit fainthearted right now and a sudden push would overthrow him
Ride ride Messala
I’ve become an enemy to my own soldiers
Oh Cassius Brutus gave the orders too soon
Retreat further my lord retreat further
Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
Therefore you must run noble Cassius
Are those my tents on fire
They are my lord
Titinius if you love me get on your horse and spur him on until he’s brought you to those troops and back again so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies
I’ll be back quicker than you can think a thought
Go Pindarus climb a little higher on this hill
My eyesight has always been bad
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field
Today was the day I breathed my first breath
Time has come round and I’ll end where I began
My life has run its circle
What news
And listen
They shout for joy
Come down look no more
Oh I’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes
Come here boy
Come now keep your oath
Caesar you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you
So I’m free
But I didn’t want to be free like this
Oh Cassius I’ll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me
The armies have merely changed places Titinius because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus’s forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius’s legions
This news will comfort Cassius
Where did you leave him
On this hill and in despair with his slave Pindarus
Isn’t that him on the ground
He doesn’t seem to be alive
Oh my heart
Isn’t that him
Pindarus
Where are you Pindarus
Look for him Titinius while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news
I say “force” because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this
Hurry Messala and I’ll look for Pindarus in the meantime
Why did you send me out brave Cassius
Didn’t I meet up with your allies
And didn’t they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you
Didn’t you hear their shouts
Alas you misunderstood everything
But let me place this wreath on your head
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you and I’ll do what he says
Where is his body Messala
Over there where Titinius mourns it
Titinius is lying face up
He’s been killed
Oh Julius Caesar you are still powerful
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two
Good bye to you the last of all the Romans
I will find the time to cry for you Cassius I’ll find the time
Come then and send his body to Thasos
Let’s proceed to the field
Labio and Flavio push our armies onward
It is three o'clock and Romans before night we will try our luck in a second battle
Who is so low that he wouldn’t
Who will advance with me
I will proclaim my name around the field
I am the son of Marcus Cato
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country
I am the son of Marcus Cato
And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus
Brutus my country’s friend
Know that I am Brutus
Oh young and noble Cato have you been slain
I’d rather die
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing
We must not
He is a noble prisoner
Make room
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken
I’ll tell him the news
Where is he
He’s safe Antony
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive
The gods protect him from so great a shame
The games are done and Caesar is returning
As they pass by grab Casca by the sleeve and he’ll tell you if anything important happened today in his usual sour way
I’ll do so
But look Cassius Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they’ve been scolded
Calphurnia’s face is pale and Cicero’s eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol
Casca will tell us what’s the matter
Antonio
Caesar
Come last of my friends rest on this rock
Statilius waved the torchlight at us but he hasn’t come back
He’s been captured or killed
Sit down Clitus
Listen Clitus
Who me my lord
No not for all the world
Silence then
Don’t give it away
I’d rather kill myself
Listen Dardanius
Would I dare do something like that
Oh Dardanius
Oh Clitus
Come here good Volumnius
Listen a minute
What is it my lord
Once at Sardis and once last night here in Philippi fields
I know that my hour has come
No it hasn’t my lord
No I’m sure it has Volumnius
You see how the world goes Volumnius
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave
It’s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us
Good Volumnius you know that we went to school together
For the sake of our old friendship I ask you hold my sword handle while I run on it
That’s not a job for a friend my lord
Run run my lord
We can’t wait here
Farewell to you and you and you Volumnius
Strato you’ve slept this whole time
I’ll have glory in this losing day more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest
So farewell all for my tongue has almost finished with its life
I can’t see ahead of me
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour
Run my lord run
Go on
I’ll follow
I beg you Strato stay by me
You’re a man with a good reputation
Your life has had honor in it
Then hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it
Will you Strato
Give me your hand first
Farewell good Strato
What man is that
Free from the bondage you are in Messala
I’ll take all who served Brutus into my service
You will you join with me
Yes if Messala recommends me to you
Do so good Messala
How did my master die Strato
I held the sword and he ran on it
Then take this man into your service Octavius for he did the final service to my master
This was the noblest Roman of them all
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good
His life was gentle and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world “This was a man” Let’s treat him according to his virtue with all the respect and rituals of burial
His body will lie in my tent tonight with the honorable observance that suits a soldier
So order the armies to rest and let’s go home to share the glories of this happy day
Yes Casca
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood
But you were with him weren’t you
If I were I wouldn’t need to ask you what happened
A crown was offered to him and he pushed it away with the back of his hand like this and then the people started shouting
What was the second noise for
The same thing
They shouted three times
What was the last cry for
For the same thing
The crown was offered to him three times
Yes indeed it was and he pushed it away three times each time more gently than the last and at each refusal my countrymen shouted
Who offered him the crown
Antony
Tell us how it happened noble Casca
I can’t explain it
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown though it wasn’t a real crown just a small circlet and as I told you he refused it once though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it
Then Antony offered it to him again and he refused it again (though in my opinion he was reluctant to take his hand off it)
Then Antony offered it the third time
As for myself I didn’t dare laugh for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air
But wait a minute please
Did you say Caesar fainted
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless
That’s very likely
He has epilepsy a disease where you fall down
No Caesar doesn’t have epilepsy
You and I and honest Casca we have epilepsy we’ve fallen
I don’t know what you mean by that but I’m sure Caesar fell down
What did he say when he regained consciousness
Indeed before he fell down when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut
If I’d been a common laborer and hadn’t taken him up on his offer to hell with me
And so he fainted
When he regained consciousness again he said that if he’d done or said anything wrong he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness
Three or four women near me cried “Alas good soul” and forgave him with all their hearts
But never mind them if Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would’ve forgiven him
And after that he came back here looking so serious
Yes
Get out of here
Go home you lazy men
What is today a holiday
I’m a carpenter sir
Where are your leather apron and your ruler
What are you doing wearing your best clothes
And you sir what’s  Well compared to a fine workman you might call me a mere cobbler
But what’s your trade
Answer me straightforwardly
It is a trade sir that I practice with a clear conscience
What trade boy
You insolent rascal what trade
Sir please don’t be angry
But if your soles are worn out I can mend you
What do you mean by that
Mend” me you impertinent fellow
Did Cicero say anything
Yes he said something in Greek
What did he say
If I told you I understood Greek I’d be lying
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads
As for myself it was Greek to me
I have more news too
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar
There you go
There was even more foolishness if I could only remember it
Will you have dinner with me tonight Casca
No I have a commitment
Will you dine with me tomorrow
Yes if I’m still alive and you’re still sane and your dinner is worth eating
Good
I’ll expect you
Do so
Farewell to you both
What a stupid man he’s become
He was so sharp when he was in school
He’s still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise though he puts on this show of stupidity
He speaks roughly but what he says is smart and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him
You’re right that’s how it is
I’ll leave you for now
If you’d like to talk tomorrow I’ll come to your home
Or if you don’t mind come to my home and I’ll wait for you
I’ll do so
Until then think about the well being of Rome
Well Brutus you’re noble
Caesar resents me but he loves Brutus
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me I wouldn’t have let him influence me
Tonight I’ll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting as if they came from several citizens all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus and all alluding to Caesar’s unseemly ambition
Did you accompany Caesar home
Cicero I’ve seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees and I’ve seen the ocean swell rage and foam as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds but never before tonight never until now have I experienced a storm that drops fire
Either there are wars in heaven or else the world too insolent toward the gods provokes them to send destruction
Also I’ve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon
When all these extraordinary things happen at once we shouldn’t say “These happenings can be explained rationally
They’re natural enough” I think these things are omens of things to come in our country
Indeed it’s a strange time
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves
Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow
He is because he told Antonius to tell you he’d be there tomorrow
Good night then Casca
This bad weather isn’t good to walk around in
A Roman
It’s Casca I know your voice
Your ear is good
Cassius what a night this is
It’s a very pleasing night to honest men
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth
I have walked around the streets exposing myself to the perilous night unbuttoned like this as you see Casca baring my chest to the thunderbolt
When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky I put myself right where I thought it would hit
But why did you tempt the heavens like that
Mankind’s role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals
You’re acting stupid Casca and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have or else you don’t use them
You go pale you stare and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens
A man no mightier than you or I in ability yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight’s strange happenings
Let it be who it is
Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak like women
Indeed they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow and he’ll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy
I know where I’ll wear this dagger then
I’ll kill myself to save myself from slavery
In suicide gods make the weak strong
In suicide gods allow tyrants to be defeated
No stony tower no brass walls no airless dungeon no iron chains can contain a strong mind
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles he can always kill himself
Let everyone beware I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose
So can I
In fact every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself
How can Caesar be a tyrant then
Poor man
I know he wouldn’t be a wolf if the Romans didn’t act like sheep
He couldn’t be a lion if the Romans weren’t such easy prey
People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs
But oh no
What have I said in my grief
Say no more
Shake my hand
If you’re joining together to right these wrongs I’ll go as far as any one of you
That’s a deal
Now let me tell you Casca I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission
And I know that by now they’re waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey’s theater
It’s Cinna
I recognize his walk
To find you
Who’s that
Metellus Cimber
No it’s Casca someone who’s going to work with us
Aren’t the others waiting for me Cinna
I’m glad Casca is with us
What a fearful night this is
Two or three of us have seen strange things
Are the others waiting
Tell me
Yes they are
Oh Cassius if you could only convince Brutus to join us  Don’t worry
Good Cinna take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge’s chair where Brutus sits so he’ll find it
When you’ve finished all this return to the porch of Pompey’s theater where you’ll find us
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
Everyone’s there except Metellus Cimber and he’s gone to look for you at your house
Well I’ll hurry and put these papers where you told me
When you’ve finished go back to Pompey’s theater
Come on Casca you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise
Yes you’re absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him
Let’s go because it’s already after midnight and we want him on our side before daylight
Wake up I say
Lucius
Did you call me my lord
Put a candle in my study Lucius
Call me when it’s lit
I will my lord
I have no personal reason to strike at him only the best interest of the people
He wants to be crowned
The question is how would being king change him
Evil can come from good just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days which means we have to walk carefully
If we crown him I have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage
Cobble you sir
You’re a cobbler are you
Sir I make my living using an awl
I’m a surgeon to old shoes
When they’re endangered I save them
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork
But why aren’t you in your shop today
Why are you leading these men through the streets
Well to wear out their shoes and get myself more work
Why would you celebrate it
What victory does he bring home
What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion
Caesar might act like that
Therefore in case he does we must hold him back
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior not what he does now I must frame the argument like this if his position is furthered his character will fulfill these predictions
The candle is burning in your study sir
While I was looking for a flint to light it I found this paper on the window sealed up like this and I’m sure it wasn’t there when I went to bed
Go back to bed
It isn’t daybreak yet
Is tomorrow the 15th of March boy
I don’t know sir
Check the calendar and come tell me
I will sir
Sir fifteen days of March have gone by
Good
Go to the gate
Somebody’s knocking
I haven’t slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar
Is he alone
Do you know them
Let them in
Oh conspiracy are you ashamed to show your face even at night when evil things are most free
If so when it’s day where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face
Instead hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness
I’m afraid we’re intruding too boldly on your sleep time
Good morning Brutus
Are we bothering you
I’ve been up all night
Do I know these men who are with you
This is Trebonius
He’s welcome here
This is Decius Brutus
He’s welcome too
This is Casca
This is Cinna
And this is Metellus Cimber
They’re all welcome
What worries have kept you awake tonight
Can I have a word with you
Here’s the east
Won’t the dawn come from here
No
You’re both wrong
And let us swear to our resolution
No let’s not swear an oath
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim
But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave and I think we do then countrymen what else could we possibly need to spur us to action
What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they’re going to do and won’t back down
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying
Swearing is for priests cowards overly cautious men feeble old people and those long suffering weaklings who welcome abuse
Only men whom you wouldn’t trust anyway would swear oaths and for the worst reasons
Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made
But what about Cicero
Should we see what he thinks
I think he will stand strong with us
Let’s not leave him out
No by no means
Yes we should get his support for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions
They’ll assume that Cicero with his sound judgment ordered the actions
No don’t even mention him
He’ll never follow anything that other men have started
Then leave him out
Indeed he’s not right for this
Good point Decius
I don’t think it would be wise to let Mark Antony whom Caesar is so fond of outlive Caesar
We’d find that he was a dangerous plotter
And as you know his connections if he put them to good use might be enough to hurt us all
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar’s head and then hack at his arms and legs too Caius Cassius because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar’s arms
Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
We’re all against what Caesar stands for and there’s no blood in that
Oh how I wish we could oppose Caesar’s spirit his overblown ambition and not hack up Caesar himself
But unfortunately Caesar has to bleed if we’re going to stop him
Noble friends let’s kill him boldly but not with anger
Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs
Let’s be angry only long enough to do the deed and then let’s act like we’re disgusted by what we had to do
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful
If he loves Caesar then he can only hurt himself by grieving and dying for Caesar
And I’d be surprised if he even did that for he prefers sports fun and friends
There’s nothing to fear in him
Quiet
Count how many times the clock chimes
The clock struck three
It’s time to leave
It might happen that these strange signs the unusual terror of this night and the urgings of his fortune tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today
Don’t worry about that
If he’s reluctant I can convince him
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers just like unicorns can be captured in trees elephants in holes and lions with nets
When I tell him he hates flatterers he agrees just at the moment when I’m flattering him the most
Let me work on him
I can put him in the right mood and I’ll bring him to the Capitol
No we’ll all go there to bring him
By eight o'clock
Is that the latest we can do it
Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar who berated him for speaking well of Pompey
I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support
Good Metellus go to him now
He likes me and I’ve given him good reason to
Just send him here and I’ll persuade him
The morning is approaching
We’ll leave Brutus
Friends go your separate ways
But all of you remember what you’ve said and prove yourselves true Romans
Good gentlemen look like you’re rested and happy
And so good morning to all of you
Boy
Lucius
Fast asleep
Well enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep
That’s why you sleep so soundly
Brutus my lord
Portia what are you doing awake
It isn’t good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw cold morning
It’s not good for your health either
You rudely snuck out of bed
And last night at dinner you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed brooding and sighing and when I asked you what was the matter you gave me a dirty look
I asked you again and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was but you wouldn’t answer me instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone
My dear lord tell me what’s bothering you
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar who comes in triumph over Pompey’s defeated sons
Go home
Run to your houses fall on your knees and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude
Go go good countrymen and to make up for having done wrong gather up all the poor men like yourselves lead them to the Tiber and weep into the river until it overflows its banks
You go down toward the Capitol and I’ll go this way
Undress the statues if they’re decorated in honor of Caesar
Can we do that
I’ll walk around and force the commoners off the streets
You do the same wherever the crowds are thick
If we take away Caesar’s support he’ll have to come back down to earth otherwise he’ll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience
I’m not feeling well that’s all
You’re smart though and if you were sick you’d take what you needed to get better
I’m doing so
Good Portia go to bed
Are you sick
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning
You’re sick yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease infested air make you sicker
Don’t kneel noble Portia
You’re my true and honorable wife as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart
If that were true then I’d know your secret
I admit I’m only a woman but nevertheless I’m the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife
I admit I’m only a woman but I’m still a woman from a noble family I’m Cato’s daughter
Do you really think I’m no stronger than the rest of my sex with such a father and such a husband
Tell me your secrets
I won’t betray them
I’ve proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh
If I can bear that pain then I can bear my husband’s secrets
Oh gods make me worthy of this noble wife
Listen
Someone knocks
Leave me quickly
Lucius who’s that knocking
Here’s a sick man who wants to speak with you
How I wish you felt better
I’m not sick if you’ve prepared some honorable exploit for me
Indeed I would have such an exploit for you Ligarius if you were healthy enough to hear it
A deed that will make sick men healthy
But aren’t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick
That too
My dear Caius I’ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to
Follow me then
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight
Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep “Help someone
They’re murdering Caesar” Who’s there
My lord
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately and bring me their interpretation of the results
I will my lord
What are you doing Caesar
Are you planning to go out
You’re not leaving the house today
I will go out
The things that threaten me have only seen my back
When they see the face of Caesar they will vanish
Caesar I never believed in omens but now they frighten me
A servant told me the night watchmen saw horrid sights too but different ones from what we heard and saw
A lioness gave birth in the streets and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead
Fierce fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war ranks and squadrons until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol
Oh Caesar
These things are beyond anything we’ve seen before and I’m afraid
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen
But I will go out for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes
Cowards die many times before their deaths
The brave experience death only once
Of all the strange things I’ve ever heard it seems most strange to me that men fear death given that death which can’t be avoided will come whenever it wants
What do the priests say
They don’t want you to go out today
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn’t find its heart
The gods do this to test my bravery
They’re saying I’d be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear
So I won’t
We’re two lions born on the same day in the same litter and I’m the older and more terrible
I will go out
Alas my lord your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom
Don’t go out today
Say that it’s my fear that keeps you inside and not your own
We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house and he’ll say that you’re sick today
Mark Antony will say I’m not well and to please you I’ll stay at home
Here’s Decius Brutus
He’ll tell them so
Hail Caesar
Good morning worthy Caesar
I’ve come to take you to the senate house
And you’ve come at a good time so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won’t come today
Would I send a lie
Have I accomplished so much in battle but now I’m afraid to tell some old men the truth
Decius go tell them that Caesar won’t come
Most mighty Caesar give me some reason so I won’t be laughed at when I tell them so
The reason is that it’s what I want
I’m not coming
That’s enough for the senate
But for your private satisfaction because I love you I’ll tell you
Calphurnia my wife is keeping me at home
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come and on her knee she begged me to stay home today
This dream has been interpreted all wrong
It was a good and lucky vision
Your statue spouting blood through many holes in which many smiling Romans bathed means that you’ll provide great Rome with sustaining blood and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood
This is what Calphurnia’s dream means
You’ve offered an excellent interpretation
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today
If you send them word that you won’t come they might change their minds
How foolish your fears seem now Calphurnia
I’m ashamed that I yielded to them
Give me my robe because I’m going
And look here’s Publius come to fetch me
Good morning Caesar
Welcome Publius
Caius Ligarius I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that’s made you so thin
What time is it
Caesar the clock has struck eight
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy
And to you most noble Caesar
I’m to blame for making you wait for me
Trebonius
Remember to see me today
Stay near me so I’ll remember
Caesar I will
Good friends go in and have some wine with me
And we’ll leave together like friends
Calphurnia
Quiet
Caesar’s talking
Calphurnia
I’m here my lord
Yes Caesar
I’ll remember
When Caesar says “do this” it is done
Continue then and don’t forget to perform all of the rituals
Caesar
Caesar beware of Brutus
Watch Cassius
Don’t go near Casca
Keep an eye on Cinna
Don’t trust Trebonius
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber
Decius Brutus doesn’t love you
You’ve wronged Caius Ligarius
These men all have one intention and it’s directed against Caesar
If you aren’t immortal watch those around you
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy
I pray that the mighty gods defend you
Your friend      Artemidorus” I’ll stand here until Caesar passes by and I’ll give him this as though it’s a petition
If you read this Caesar you might live
If not the Fates are on the side of the traitors
Boy I beg you to run to the senate house
Don’t stay to answer me get going
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there
Madam what should I do
Run to the Capitol and nothing else
And then return to you and nothing else
Yes return and tell me if your master looks well because he was sick when he left
And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him
Listen boy
What’s that noise
I don’t hear anything madam
I beg you listen well
Truly madam I don’t hear anything
Come here you
Where are you coming from
My own house good lady
What time is it
Around nine o'clock madam
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet
Madam not yet
I’m going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol
You have some plea for Caesar don’t you
Yes I do lady
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me I’ll try to get him to do what’s good for him
Why do you know of any harm intended toward him
Nothing that I know for sure but a lot that I’m afraid might happen
Good morning to you
The street is narrow here
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels senators justices common petitioners will suffocate a feeble man almost to death
I’ll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past
I must go in
Yes Caesar but it’s not gone yet
Oh Caesar read mine first for my petition affects you more directly
Read it great Caesar
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last
Don’t delay Caesar
Read it instantly
What is the man insane
You have weapons
What’s going on here
Stop it I order you
The next person to strike again dies
What’s going on here
These are the messengers from my sister and the king
What are you fighting about
Tell me
I’m out of breath sir
A tailor made you
That’s an odd thing to say
How can a tailor make a person
Definitely a tailor sir
A sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that even as an apprentice
But tell me what you’re fighting about
Calm down
Don’t you have any manners you savage
Yes sir but not when I’m enraged
Why are you enraged
Are you laughing at what I say as if I were a fool
Are you insane old man
Why are you calling him a jerk
What did he do to you
I don’t like his face
But maybe you don’t like mine or his or hers either
This is a guy who’s been praised for his honest bluntness and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words
No flattery for him no sir
He’s honest he’s got to speak the truth
If people take what he says fine
If not he’s got truth on his side
Dearest kindest most honorable sir may I say with your esteemed approval which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun god Phoebus that  What do you mean by that
I tried to stop speaking plainly since you dislike plain speech so much
Sir I know I’m not a flatterer
I never offended him at all
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men
Don’t put me in the stocks
I serve the king who sent me here
If you put me in the stocks you’ll insult him both as a king and as a man
Bring out the stocks
I swear on my life and honor he’ll sit here in the stocks until noon
Only until noon my lord
No the whole day and all night too
Ma'am you wouldn’t treat me like this if I were your father’s dog
But since you’re his scoundrel servant I will
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about Come on bring in the stocks now
I beg you not to do this my lord
He’s done wrong and his master the king will punish him for it
The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated
I’ll take responsibility for that
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders Put his legs in the stocks
I’m sorry my friend
I’ll try talking to him again
Please don’t sir
Even good men have bad luck
Have a good morning
It’s wrong for the duke to do this
The king will be angry with him
honor you
Hopefully when I get married I’ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty
I’m sure I’ll never get married in the way my sisters say they’re married loving their father only
But do you mean what you’re saying
Yes my lord
So young and so cruel
So young my lord and honest
Then that’s the way it’ll be
The truth will be all the inheritance you get
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you ex daughter of mine
But sir  Be quiet Kent
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout waiting to capture me
I’ll smear my face with filth put on a loincloth make my hair matted and tangled and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing
Well at least that’s something
As Edgar I’m nothing at all
It’s strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger
According to what I heard they had no travel plans as of last night
What’s this
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself
No my lord
Ha ha
That’s a nasty garter belt
You tie up horses by their heads dogs and bears by their necks monkeys by their waists and humans by their legs
Your daughter and son in law
No
Yes
No no they wouldn’t
Yes they have
By the god Jupiter above I swear “No” By Jupiter’s wife Juno I swear “Yes” They wouldn’t dare
They couldn’t they wouldn’t
It’s worse than murder to humiliate a king’s messenger like this
My lord when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams
That’s why your daughter and son in law are punishing me shamefully
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind
Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break
But despite all this your daughters will give you a lot of money or do I mean pain in the coming year
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart
Inside sir with the earl
Don’t follow me
Stay here
You didn’t do anything else to earn this punishment
Nothing
Tell me why did the king arrive with such a small entourage
If they’d put you in the stocks for asking that question you would’ve deserved it
Why Fool
You need to learn what ants know well about winter there’s no point in slaving away if there’s no hope for profit
Everyone can see that and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now
When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill you shouldn’t try to hold on to it or it’ll break your neck
But if you see a wheel going uphill latch on for the ride
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did give me my advice back again
I only want idiots following my advice the advice of a fool
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm
But I’ll linger
The fool will stay
And let the wise man run away
Where did you learn that song Fool
Not in the stocks fool
How can they refuse to speak with me
They’re playing with me
These are tricks
This is rebellion
My dear lord you know how passionately stubborn the duke is
Damn it all to hell
Passionately”
What “passion”
Gloucester Gloucester I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife
My lord I informed them as much
Informed them”
Do you understand what I’m saying man
Yes my lord
The king wants to speak with Cornwall
Did you inform them of that
This is unbelievable
Passionate”
The “passionate” duke
Tell the hot headed duke that I… But no not yet
Maybe he’s not feeling well
I just want everything to be all right between you
Oh my heart my heart is rising into my throat
Stay down heart
That’s right uncle talk to your heart like the  Good morning to you both
Hail to your majesty
I’m glad to see your highness
I believe you are Regan
You know why I think so
My dear Regan your sister’s not worth anything
Oh Regan she’s torn me apart with unkindness like a vulture right here
Calm down sir please
How do you mean
I can’t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way
If she restrained your rowdy knights she had such a good reason that you can’t blame her for it
I curse her
Sir you’re old
Your life is stretched to its limit
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what’s good for you
Please go back to Goneril’s house
Admit you were wrong
Apologize
No more please
These are ugly antics
Go back to my sister’s
Shush sir please
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion
Oh dear gods
That’s how you’ll talk about me when you’re in this mood
Her eyes are vicious but yours are comforting
You haven’t forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you
Sir let’s get to the point
Get out of my sight I guess if she doesn’t love her father then I’ll only have peace when I’m dead Call the King of France
Call the Duke of Burgundy
If she wants to be proud or “honest” as she calls it she can just marry her own pride
King Lear I’ve always honored you as king loved you as my father obeyed you as my master and thanked you in my prayers  I’m furious and ready to snap
Let your anger fall on me then even if its sharpness pierces my heart
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad
What are you doing old man
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it
When a majestic king starts acting silly then it’s my duty to be blunt
What’s that trumpet
I know it
She’ll be here soon just like her letter said
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for Get out of my sight scoundrel
What do you mean your highness
Who put my servant in the stocks
Regan I hope you didn’t know anything about that Ah who’s this
Why shouldn’t she take my hand father
How exactly have I offended you
I sent him there sir but his crimes deserved a worse punishment
You
You did it
Please father since you’re weak act like it
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister
Right now I’m away from home and I can’t provide you with proper care
Go back with her
Go back with her
I might as well go before the King of France who took my youngest daughter without a dowry kneel before his throne and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive
Go back with her
I’d rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here
As you wish sir
I beg you daughter don’t make me crazy
I won’t bother you
We’ll never see each other again
But you’re still my child my flesh and blood or rather you’re a disease in my flesh a disease I still have to call my own
You’re a pustule a sore a tumor digesting my bloodline
But I’ll stop rebuking you
I won’t beg the gods to punish you or caution you to fear their judgment
Become a better
person when you’re ready if you’re inclined
I’ll wait patiently
Meanwhile I’ll stay with Regan with my hundred knights
It’s not quite that simple
I wasn’t expecting you and I’m not ready to receive you
Please hear what Goneril is saying
We’re trying to be reasonable while you’re so upset and we understand that you’re old and… But Goneril knows what she’s doing
Yes I do
How could so many people under two masters get along under one roof
It would be hard almost impossible
Why couldn’t you be attended by my servants or by Regan’s
Yes why not my lord
Then if they’re negligent we could control them
Now that I think about the danger of these knights if you come to stay with me please bring no more than twenty five of them with you
I won’t lodge any more than that under my roof
I gave you everything  And it was about time too
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty five
Regan is that what you said
Yes I’ll say it again my lord
No more than twenty five
Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise I guess
Hear me out my lord
Why do you need twenty five knights or ten or even five when you’re staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service
Why do you need even one
Oh don’t ask me why I “need” them
You’re a well dressed lady
If you dressed only to stay warm you wouldn’t need these gorgeous clothes you’re wearing which don’t keep you warm at all
Oh gods give me patience
You see me here gods a grieving old man as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age
If you’re the ones setting my daughters against me don’t let me be foolish enough to take it lying down
man’s cheeks
No you monstrous hags I’ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world… I will do such things I don’t know what I’ll do exactly but it’ll be devastating
You expect me to cry
Well I won’t
I have a good reason to cry but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry Oh Fool I’ll go mad
Let’s go inside
There’s going to be a storm
This is a small house
There’s no room for the old man and his followers
It’s his fault that he’s all worked up like this
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions
That’s what I intend to do too
Where is Gloucester
He followed the old man
Here he comes back
Where’s he going
He has called for his horse but I don’t know where he’s headed
It’s best just to let him go
He won’t listen to anyone’s advice
There’s hardly a bush for miles around
Oh sir impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions
Lock the doors
His attendants are desperate violent men
I’m afraid of what they might encourage him to do considering the state he’s in
Lock the doors my lord
It’s a wild night
Regan gives good advice
Come in out of the storm
Who’s there aside from this foul weather
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather very troubled
I know you
Where’s the king
Struggling with the wind and rain
He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea or make the sea flood the earth he wants to see the world return to primal chaos
He keeps tearing out his white hair which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness
Small but brave in his surroundings he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth
He’s running bareheaded calling for the end of the world out there on a night like this when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide
But who’s with him
Nobody but the fool who’s trying to soothe the wounds in the king’s heart with jokes
Sir I know you and I trust you enough to share something very important with you
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war
Now this is where you come in
I’m a nobleman and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you
Let’s discuss it some more
Let me shake your hand
Do you have anything else to tell me
Rage on blow
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned
Let quick sulfurous lightning strong enough to split enormous trees singe the white hair on my head
Let thunder flatten the spherical world crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow
Oh uncle it’s better to smile and flatter indoors where it’s dry than get soaked out here
Please uncle let’s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools
Let thunder rumble
Let lightning spit fire
Let the rain spray
The rain the wind the thunder and lightning are not my daughters
Nature I don’t accuse your weather of unkindness
So go ahead and have your terrifying fun
Here I am your slave a poor sick weak hated old man
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn’t love you least
Kent if you want to stay alive stop talking
Get out of my sight
Learn to see better Lear and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice
Now I swear by Apollo… By Apollo King you’re taking the names of the gods in vain
Oh you lowlife
Scum
Please stop sir
Listen to me you traitor
For there never was a pretty woman who didn’t like to preen in the mirror
No I’ll be patient
I won’t say a word
Who’s there
A wise man and a fool
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light
It will give you some protection from this storm
They are harder than the stones the house is made of
I’m starting to lose my mind
That’s true my good boy Come on take us to that hut
I’ll recite a prophecy before I go
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet
This is the prophecy that the wizard
Oh oh Edmund I don’t like this monstrous business
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him lobby for him or support him in any way
That’s uncivilized and unnatural
Oh be quiet
There’s a feud between the two dukes
It’s dangerous to talk about it
I’ve locked it up in my room
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly
Armed forces have already landed
We have to take the king’s side
I’ll look for him and secretly help him
You go and talk to the duke so he won’t notice I’m helping the king
If he asks to see me tell him I’m sick and went to bed
Even if I have to die as they threaten I have to help the king
Strange things are about to happen Edmund
Please be careful
And I’ll tell him about the letter too
The young generation rises while the old one falls
Here’s the hut my lord
Please go inside
The night’s too rough for humans to bear
Leave me for a bit
My lord here is the entrance
Will you break my heart
I’d rather break my own heart
Now please go in
You think it’s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin
It’s a big deal to you
But whenever you feel a larger pain the smaller one disappears
You would run away from a bear but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean you’d turn around and confront the bear
When your mind is at peace your body is sensitive to the elements
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what’s tormenting me how ungrateful my children are
Isn’t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it
But I’ll punish them thoroughly
No I won’t cry any more
Imagine them locking me out on a night like this
But let it rain I’ll survive
On a night like this
Oh Regan Goneril your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything Oh if I think about that I’ll go mad
I want to avoid that
No more of these thoughts
My lord please go inside here
Go inside yourself
Make yourself comfortable
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more
But I’ll go in
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel
Don’t come in here uncle
There’s a spirit in here
Help me help me
Give me your hand
Who’s there
A ghost a ghost
He says his name’s Poor Tom
Who are you moaning in the hut like that
Come out
Go away
The devil’s after me
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees
Ha
Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this
Bless your five senses
Tom’s chilly
Oh do de do de do de
God protect you from tornadoes evil stars and diseases
Take pity on Poor Tom who is persecuted by the devil
There… And over there… And over there
Have his daughters made him crazy like this Couldn’t you have kept something for yourself
Did you have to give them everything
If he hadn’t we’d all be embarrassed to look at him
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners
He doesn’t have any daughters sir
Like hell
Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this
Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity
I’m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen
Beware of the devil
Obey your parents keep your word don’t swear don’t sleep with another man’s wife and don’t covet flashy clothes
Tom’s chilly
What were you before this
I loved wine and gambling and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem
The cold wind’s still blowing through the hawthorn tree
Look at him
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor naked two legged animal like you
Let me unbutton this
Please calm down uncle
This is a nasty night to go swimming
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man a tiny spark in a cold body
Look here comes a walking fire
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn
And go away witch go away
How are you your highness
Who are you
What do you want
Who are you
What are your names
Calm down Smulkin you fiend
He’s called Modo and Mahu
Poor Tom’s chilly
Come back to my house with me
I couldn’t bear to obey all of your daughters' harsh orders
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm but I’ve come out here to find you and take you where there’s warmth and food
First let me talk with this philosopher here 
Now get out of here
I swear by Jupiter I’ll never revoke this punishment
Farewell King
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy my lord
My lord the ruler of Burgundy I’ll speak to you first
You’ve been competing with this king for my daughter
Let me ask you something in private
Can you blame him
His daughters want to kill him
Ah good old Kent said this would happen that poor banished man
You say the king is losing his mind
Let me tell you my friend I’m almost insane myself
I had a son whom I’ve legally disowned
He tried to kill me recently very recently
I loved him as much as any father ever loved his son
What a storm
Excuse me sir  Tom’s chilly
Stay warm
Come on let’s all go inside
This way my lord
Come on my dear Greek philosopher
I’ll get my revenge before I leave this house
I’m afraid to think how I’ll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself
How unlucky am I having to apologize for doing the right thing
Come with me to see the duchess
If this letter’s right you’ve got a lot to deal with
Right or not it’s made you the Earl of Gloucester
I put my trust in you
It’s better here than outside
Be happy about it
I’ll do what I can to make you even more comfortable
I won’t be gone long
He can’t bear his grief and so he’s losing his mind
May God reward you for your kindness
He’s a king a king
No he’s an ordinary guy who ’s got a gentleman for a son since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he’s achieved that distinction himself
I see Regan and Goneril in hell A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them
The nasty devil’s biting my butt
I’ll do it
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom
The demon Hoppedance is in Tom’s belly crying for some fish to eat
Stop whining devil
I’ve got no food to give you
Let’s have the evidence
Let’s give a fair verdict
There she is
Come here ma'am
Is your name Goneril
She can’t deny it
And here’s Regan whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart
Stop her
Fire
You corrupt judge why did you let her escape
Bless your heart
Look at the three little dogs Tray Blanch and Sweetheart all barking at me
Tom will chase them off Go away you mongrels
Whether you bite to kill Mastiff greyhound or ugly mutt
Hound or spaniel bitch or dog Whether your tail is short or curly  Tom will make you cry and wail
With one little toss of his head He can scare you off for good
Whether your mouth is black or white Do dee dee dee da
Stop
Run off go visit fairs and festivals
Poor Tom your cup is empty
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart
Please lie down and rest a while my lord
Be quiet be quiet
Draw the curtains just like that
We’ll have supper in the morning
That’s right
And I’ll go to bed at noon
He’s here sir but please don’t bother him
He’s out of his right mind
Please get him my friend I beg you
Put
Carry your master out
Come on come on
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do we can almost forget our own misery
The person who suffers alone suffers the most
Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief
Let’s go Tom
Whatever else happens tonight I hope the king escapes safely
Lurk out of sight
Hang him immediately
Gouge out his eyes
Leave him to my wrath Edmund go with my sister in law
You shouldn’t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately
We will do the same
We’ll keep the lines of communication open between us
Hello
Where’s the king
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave
Thirty five or thirty six of his knights met him at the gate and together with some others they’ve set off for Dover where they claim to have powerful friends
Prepare the horses for your lady
Goodbye my sweet lord Goodbye my sister
Goodbye Edmund
Go find the traitor Gloucester
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me
That’s him
Tie up his withered old arms
What are you doing
My friends remember that you’re my guests here
Don’t play any nasty tricks on me
Tie him up I tell you
Your highness I want nothing more than what you’ve already offered
I know you’ll offer nothing less than that
There she is over there
I don’t know what to say
So do you take her or leave her
Then leave her sir
Tie him up harder You filthy traitor
I’m not a traitor unfair lady
Tie him to this chair You’ll see criminal  By the gods it’s disgraceful for you to pull my beard
As old and white haired as you are and you’re such a traitor
Wicked woman these white hairs you’re pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong doing
You are my guests
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house
What do you think you’re doing
Tell us about the letters that you got from France
Get to the point since we already know the truth
And what’s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently
The ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to
Tell us
It came from a neutral party not from someone opposed to you
How clever of you
Clever lies
Where have you sent the king
To Dover
Why Dover
Weren’t you ordered on penalty of  Why Dover Let him answer that question first
I’m backed into a corner with nowhere to run
Why Dover
Because I didn’t want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh
You left him out in the storm in the black night bareheaded a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars
And the poor old man just wept mixing his tears with the rain
If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm you would’ve told your doorman to let them in despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world
But soon I’ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father
You won’t be seeing anything Hold his chair still men I’m going to put my foot on his eyes
Oh help me anyone who wants to live long
Oh so cruel
Oh dear gods
Now he’s a little crooked
I’ve served you since childhood but I’ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop
What’s this you dog
I am willing to fight you if I must
What do you mean by all this
Come on then
I am dying My lord you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished
Oh
Where’s your sparkle now
Where’s my son Edmund
Wrong evil traitor
You’re appealing to a son who hates you
He’s too good to have any compassion for you
What a fool I’ve been
This means I’ve mistreated Edgar
He can sniff his way to Dover
I’m wounded
Follow me madam Throw the blind traitor outside
And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit Regan I’m bleeding
It’s a bad time for such an injury
Give me your arm
If our criminal master gets off free I won’t care what happens to me anymore
If she lives a long and happy life then all women may as well turn into monsters
Let’s follow the old earl and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go
As a wandering lunatic he can do whatever he wants
Go ahead
I’ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face
Heaven help him
At the bottom any change is for the better
So I welcome this wind freely
But who is this
My father led by a poor peasant
Oh life is full of surprises
We age and die because they wear us out
I’ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years
Away get out of here
Leave me my friend
But you can’t see where you’re going sir
I don’t have anywhere to go so I don’t need to see
When I could see I didn’t always see clearly
It’s often the case that having something makes us spoiled while not having it turns out to be advantageous
If I live long enough to touch you again that would be as good as having my eyesight back
Who’s that
Who’s there
Is it a beggar
I was reminded of my son even though I despised my son at that time
Now I know better
Is that the naked guy
Yes my lord
But sir he’s crazy
It’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind
Do as I asked you
Or rather do what you feel like doing
Hey naked guy  Poor Tom’s chilly
Come here man
Do you know the way to Dover
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind
Bless you master
Yes sir
There’s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea
Take me to the edge of it and I’ll reward all your troubles with something valuable
Once I’m there I won’t need a guide anymore
Give me your arm
Poor Tom will take you there
Welcome my lord
I’m surprised my bland husband didn’t meet me on the way here
Where’s your master
But it’d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible
Enough
It would’ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did
You mean this is the whole problem that she is shy and hasn’t said everything she means to say and do My lord of Burgundy what do you have to say to this lady
Love’s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters
Will you marry her
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be
I’m at your service until death
My dear Gloucester
What a man especially compared to my husband
Edmund you deserve me to be your woman
There’s a fool sharing my bed now
Ma'am my master’s coming
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions
Goneril you aren’t worth the dust the wind blows in your face
I don’t trust you
You can’t trust anyone who abuses her own father her flesh and blood
She will wither and come to a bad end
Oh shut up
Your words are idiotic
Bad people can’t appreciate wisdom or goodness
They only like things as bad as themselves
What have you two sisters done
You’re tigers not daughters
Could my good brother in law a man to whom the
Coward
Shame on you warped hag
Your true demonic features are distorting your body
If I let myself do what I yearn to I’d rip the flesh off your bones
But I won’t attack a woman even if she is a demon
I sneeze on your manhood
What news do you bring
Gloucester’s eyes
There’s justice in heaven after all
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof
But oh poor Glou cester
Did he lose his other eye
He lost both my lord Ma'am this letter is from your sister and needs an immediate answer
He was on his way here with your wife
But he isn’t here now
No my lord
Yes my lord
He was the one who denounced his father
What else you do know
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence
Whom did he leave in charge here
The marshal of France Monsieur la Far
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered
Yes sir
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions which were overwhelming her
So she was moved by it
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow then sorrow would be highly prized
She didn’t ask anything
Actually once or twice she sighed and said “father” as if the word were pressing on her chest
Once she exclaimed “Sisters sisters shame on you
Kent father sisters
What out in a storm in the middle of the night
I can’t believe it” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water
Then she ran away to grieve alone
Have you not spoken to her since then
No
Did this happen before the King of France returned home
No afterward
Why good sir
He’s too overwhelmed with shame
He remembers how unkind he was to her how he disowned her and sent her abroad how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog hearted sisters
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia
Oh the poor man
Have you heard about Albany’s and Cornwall’s troops
I have
They’re on the march
Well sir I’ll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer
When I’ve revealed my true identity you’ll be glad you took the time to help me out
Please come with me
Sadly it’s the king that’s missing
They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea singing loudly wearing a crown of nettles thorns hemlock and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields Send out a hundred soldiers to find him
Search high and low in every acre of the fields and bring him here for me to see him
There is a way ma'am
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while
Then I’ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow
May they relieve a sick old man’s suffering
Go find those herbs for him before his madness puts his life in danger
I have news ma'am
The British forces are on their way here
We already knew that
Our forces are ready for them
Oh father I’m taking care of your business
That’s why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears
We’re not invading England out of ambition or greed but out of love dear love and my father’s right to his kingdom
I hope I see him and hear him again soon
Have my brother in law’s troops been mobilized
Yes ma'am
Is he there in person
Yes making a big fuss
Your sister’s the better soldier of the two
Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home
No ma'am
What could my sister’s letter to him say
I don’t know ma'am
He rushed away on serious business
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him
Wherever he goes he inspires compassion and people turn against us
And also to find out the size of the enemy army
I have to follow him and give him the letter
Our troops are deployed tomorrow
Stay with us tonight
It’s dangerous out there
Peace to you my lord of Burgundy
Since you love money and power so much I won’t be your wife
I’ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now if it’s okay that I’m picking up what others have thrown away
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now Say goodbye to them Cordelia even though they’ve been unkind to you
She’s no longer my daughter and I’ll never see her face again
Say goodbye to your sisters
I can’t ma'am
My lady ordered me to deliver her letter
Why would she write to Edmund
It probably has something to do with… I don’t know
Ma'am I’d rather  I know your lady Goneril doesn’t love her husband
I’m sure of that
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances
I know she trusts you and tells you everything
Me ma'am
I know what I’m talking about
So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say
My husband is dead
Edmund and I have talked and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril
You can figure out the rest
Goodbye
When will we get to the top of that cliff
The ground feels flat to me
No it’s dreadfully steep
No really I don’t
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness
It may be so
It seems to me that your voice has changed and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be
You’re mistaken about all that
The only thing different about me is my clothes
I think you’re more articulate
Come on sir
This is the place
Stand still
It’s so scary to look down
The crows flying down below look as small as ants
Halfway down the cliff there’s somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs a risky business
That big ship over there looks no bigger
Up here you can’t even hear the waves crashing against the rocks
Lead me to where you’re standing
Give me your hand
You’re now within a foot of the cliff’s edge
Let go of my hand
Goodbye good sir
With all my heart
Oh you mighty gods
Gone sir
Goodbye
Go away and let me die
You just fell the height of ten ship masts straight down
It’s a miracle you’re alive
Say something again
But did I fall or not
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff
Look for yourself see the top of the cliff way up there
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard
Just look
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people
Give me your arm
Get up
How do you feel
Can you feel your legs
You’re standing
Only too well
This is beyond weird
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell
That was a poor unlucky beggar
From down here I thought his eyes looked like full moons
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns like wave crests in a storm at sea
It was some devil
I understand now
From now on I’ll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out “Enough enough” and disappears
I thought that thing you’re talking about was a man
Cheer up and be at peace
But who is that
I’m the king himself
Life’s better at
piece of cheese will get him I challenge you to a match
Oh that arrow was well shot
Whoosh
Sweet marjoram
That’s it
I know that voice
Ha
Goneril with a white beard
I tell you they are not honest men
They told me I was everything
I recognize something about that voice
Isn’t that the king
Yes every inch a king
I pardon that man
What are you accused of
Adultery
I’ll commute your death sentence
To die for adultery
No
Little birds do it and dragonflies copulate right in front of me
Let’s have more sex in the world since Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters conceived in lawful wedlock have been to me
Get to it be lustful sleep around I need soldiers for my army
Women are sex machines below the waist though they’re chaste up above
That’s where hell is and darkness and fires and stench
Give me an aphrodisiac pharmacist
There’s money in it for you
Oh let me kiss his hand
Let me wipe it off first
I remember your eyes quite well
Are you squinting at me
Read it
How
With my eye sockets
Oh ho is that what you’re getting at
No eyes in your head til there’s money in your wallet
What are you crazy
You don’t need eyes to see how the world works
Look with your ears
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief
Have you seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar
Yes sir
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt
That’s authority
You stupid cop stop your violence
Why are you whipping that whore
You should be whipping yourself since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you’re punishing her
One criminal punishes another
You can’t blame anyone for it anyone I say
I’ll vouch for that
Believe me my friend since I have the power to stop the prosecutors
Harder harder
Like that
If you want to cry over my bad luck I’ll give you my eyes
I know you
Your name’s Gloucester
You have to be patient with me
I came here crying
The first time we see the world as newborns we cry and scream
I’ll read you a sermon
Listen to this
Oh how awful
When we’re born we cry because we’ve arrived on the stage of life like all the other fools
That’s a nice hat you’ve got there
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt
I’ll test it out
And when I’ve sneaked up on my sons in law then I’ll kill kill kill kill kill kill
What I’m a prisoner
No rescue for me
Treat me well
There’s a ransom
I need a doctor
My brains are injured
You can have anything you want
Will no one back me up
Am I all alone
That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears
Good sir 
I’ll die  You’re of royal blood and we obey you
Then there’s still a chance
Come and get it
But you’ll have to catch me
Catch me if you can
Sa sa sa sa
In a king the sight is unbearable
Hello good sir
How do you do sir
How can I help you
Have you heard any news of impending battle
Certainly
Everyone who can hear has heard about it
Could you tell me how near the enemy is
Very near and approaching fast
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now
Thank you sir
That’s all I wanted to know
I know you for what you really are but as your sister I’m reluctant to criticize you
I leave him in your care but oh if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him
Goodbye to you both
Don’t tell us what our duty is
Time will tell what you’ve got up your sleeve
Have a good life
Come with me my dear Cordelia
Sister I have a lot to say about things that concern us both
I think that our father will leave here tonight
Yes I’m sure he will to stay with you
Next month he’ll stay with us
He’s so flighty in his old age as we keep noticing
He has always loved Cordelia best and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious
The queen is here on special business and her army has moved on
Thank you sir
Gentle gods in heaven please let me die
Don’t tempt me to suicide again
Pray well father
And who are you good sir
I’m a poor man who’s been humbled by many misfortunes
Thank you very much
May heaven bless you
What good luck
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich
You old traitor repent all your sins
I hope you’re strong enough to do it
Whoa man you dare to support someone who’s been proclaimed a traitor
Get out of here before his bad luck infects you too
Let go of his arm
Oh no sir I won’t let him go sir not without a good reason
Let go of him peasant or you die
I’ll knock your teeth out sir
To hell with your sword
I know you well
You’re a hardworking villain who’d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to
Is he dead
Let’s look in his pockets
The letters he spoke of may help me
He’s dead
I’m just sorry I had to be the one to kill him
Let’s see here
Come on envelope open up for me
Reading their mail isn’t as bad
Don’t forget the vows we made to each other
The king is insane
It’d be better to be delirious and unaware of anything
Give me your hand
I think I hear the drums far away
Come father I’ll leave you at a friend’s house
Oh Kent what could I ever do to become as good as you are
I won’t live long enough and all my efforts will fail me
Just being thanked is more than enough for me madam
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth no more or less
Change into better clothes
Please take them off
I have to ask you as a favor not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right
All right my lord How’s the king doing
He’s still sleeping ma'am
Would you mind if we woke up the king
He’s slept a long time
Is he in his royal garments
Yes ma'am
Stay close by when we wake him up ma'am
I’m sure he will stay under control
All right
Please come closer  Make the music louder please
Kind and dear princess
If you hadn’t been their father your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion
And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums
Oh oh
It’s a wonder you didn’t lose your life and your mind all at once He’s waking up
Talk to him
You talk to him ma'am
That’s most appropriate
How are you my royal lord
How is your majesty doing
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave
Even my tears burn me like molten lead
Sir do you know who I am
You’re a spirit I know
Where did you die
Let him be for a bit
Where have I been
Where am I
Is it daytime
I’ve been tricked
I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition
I don’t know what to say
I can’t even be sure these are my hands
Let’s see
I feel this pinprick
I wish I knew what is happening
Please don’t make fun of me
I’m a foolish senile old man eighty something years old not an hour more or less
To put it plainly I’m afraid I’m not quite sane
I feel I should recognize you and that man
I can’t recall where I slept last night
Don’t laugh at me but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia
And I am I am
Are your tears wet
Yes indeed they are
Please don’t cry
If you have poison for me I’ll drink it
But you didn’t even though you had every reason
I had no reason no reason
Am I in France
You’re in your own kingdom sir
Don’t deceive me
You can relax ma'am
His insane period is over
But it’s dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost
Ask him to go in
Don’t trouble him further until his mind is more settled
Would your highness like to take a walk
You’ll have to bear with me
Please forgive and forget
I’m old and foolish
Is it true sir that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say
Yes it’s true sir
Who is leading his men
They say Gloucester’s bastard son is
I hear that Edgar Gloucester’s exiled son is with the Earl of Kent in Germany
You can’t trust all the rumors
It’s time to reassess the situation
The British troops are coming near
It will likely be a bloody fight
Goodbye sir
I’m afraid that may be the case madam
Now my sweet lord you know how much I like you
Tell me truthfully do you love my sister
No
I’m just worried that you’ve been cozying up to her and gotten intimate with her
No I swear on my honor I haven’t madam
He’s going senile
But then again he’s never really understood his own feelings very well
Yes he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life
Now that he’s old we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws which have turned into deep rooted habits but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age
We’ll probably witness many more outbursts from him like banishing Kent
There’s still the King of France’s farewell ceremony
Let’s put our heads together
If our father continues to use his authority as usual then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us
We’ll have to think about it carefully
We have to strike while the iron’s hot
I can’t stand her
Please my lord don’t be friendly with her
Don’t worry about me Your sister and the duke are here
Noble words sir
Why are we talking about this
Then let’s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next
I’ll meet you at your tent
Goneril are you coming with us
No
It’s the best thing to do
Please come with me
Wait until I read the letter
I was ordered not to
When the time comes tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I’ll return
Goodbye then
I’ll take a look at your letter
Prepare your troops
We’ll be ready when the time comes
Which one of them should I pick
Both
One
Neither
I can’t enjoy either of them as long as the other one’s alive
Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband’s still alive
I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war but afterward one of the sisters whichever one wants to can get rid of him
If I ever come back I’ll bring you good news
Good luck sir
We have to get out of here old man
Let me help you up
Let’s go
He and his daughter are captured
Give me your hand
Come on
I can’t go any further sir
Come on
And that’s true too
Officers take them away
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them
No no no no
Come on let’s go to prison
The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage
When you ask for my blessing I’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me
In prison we’ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change
Take them away
My Cordelia even the gods admire how much you’ve sacrificed for me
Have I hugged you yet
Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes
Wipe your eyes
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again
We’ll watch them starve to death first
Come on
Come here captain
Listen
I’ll do it sir
When you’ve finished you’ll be a happy man
Go immediately and do exactly as I wrote down
I can’t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse
If it’s work for a man I’ll do it
tody of them so I can do what’s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom
I sent the French queen with him too for the same reason
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father
I’m sorry sir but in this war I consider you a subordinate not my equal
That’s for to me to decide
Not so fast
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him
He’d really be your proxy if he married you
You’re so infatuated with him that you’re hallucinating
Are you trying to sleep with him
Nor is it up to you my lord
Yes it is you half blood
Hang on a second
What a farce
You’ve got a sword Gloucester
Blow the trumpets
Oh I’m sick sick
I feel sicker and sicker
She’s not feeling well
Take her to my tent
Come here herald Let the trumpet sound Read this out
Blow the trumpet
Again
Again
Who are you
All right then legitimate brother Edgar I have to have your lands
Look out I’m on my way up
Kent’s been banished just like that
All this so suddenly Edmund what’s going on
What’s the news
I’ve lost my name and title to a traitor
But I’m as noble as my opponent
And who is that
Who’s the spokesman for Edmund Earl of Gloucester
I’m my own spokesman
What do you have to say to me
Here’s mine
Normally I would ask you what your name is first
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart Trumpets blow
You were tricked into fighting Gloucester
According to the laws of war you didn’t have to fight a stranger
I make the laws not you
Who can prosecute me for it
Oh monstrous
Don’t ask me what I know
Follow her
She’s desperate
I’ve done everything you accuse me of and more much more
You’ll find out everything in due time
It’s all over now and so am I  Let’s forgive each other
I’m no less noble than you are Edmund
If I’m more noble than you you’ve done me wrong
My name is Edgar and I’m your father’s son
The gods are fair and they use our little vices to punish us
You’re right
That’s true
Let me embrace you
I swear I never hated you or your father
I know prince
Where have you been hiding
How did you know what happened to your poor father
Listen to my little story and when it’s done oh my heart will break
To escape the decree condemning me
I became his guide I led him and begged for him and kept him from suicide
I never oh what a mistake revealed myself to him until half an hour ago when I was in my armor
But his frail heart too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness gave out
Your words have moved me and maybe it’ll do some good
But go on
You look like you have something more to say
If there’s anything more sorrowful left to add keep it to yourself
I’m almost ready to break down hearing this much
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness but if I went on I could outdo it
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice and left him there in a trance
But who was that man
It was Kent sir the exiled Kent who after the king treated him like an enemy of the state put on a disguise and followed his king carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave
Help help oh help
What kind of help do you need
Say something man
What is that bloody knife
It’s still warm from the cut
It was just removed from from the heart of oh she’s dead
Who’s dead
Speak man
Your wife sir your wife
And her sister’s dead too poisoned by your wife
She confessed
I was engaged to both of them
All three of us will marry now in death
Here comes Kent
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall
We used to think so too
But the way he’s divided the kingdom recently nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more
Yes I’ve been responsible for his upbringing
I’ve had to acknowledge that he’s my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment
Do you smell something naughty
Well I wouldn’t want to undo the naughtiness since the boy turned out so well
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one and I don’t love him any more than I love my bastard
Oh is that Kent
I’ve come to say farewell to my king and master
Isn’t he here
What an enormous thing for us to forget Edmund tell us where’s the king
And where’s Cordelia  Do you see this Kent
Oh why is this so
Still Edmund was beloved
One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me and then killed herself
Apparently so Cover their faces
I wish I could live longer
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature
Go quickly hurry to the castle for I’ve given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed
Hurry send someone immediately
Run run oh run
Whom should we look for in the castle Whose job is it
Send something along to prove you’re withdrawing the orders
Good idea
Take my sword
The captain give it to the captain
Run as if your life depended on it
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair
Heaven help her Get him out of here for now
Howl howl howl howl
Oh you men are made of stone
If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with I’d crack heaven wide open with my laments
She’s gone forever
I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead
She’s as dead as the cold ground
Let me borrow a mirror
If her breath steams up the glass then she’s alive
Or just a foretaste of it
Let the world collapse around us
This feather moved because of her breath
She’s alive
If that’s true it makes up for all the sorrows I’ve ever known
Oh my good master
Please go away
It’s noble Kent your friend
Curse you all you’re all murderers and traitors
I could have saved her
Now she’s gone forever Cordelia Cordelia stay a while
Ha
It’s true my lords he did
Didn’t I
But I’m old now and suffering has weakened me
My vision is dull
Aren’t you Kent
That’s me
Your servant Kent
Where’s your servant
He’s a good fellow I can tell you that much
He’s dead and rotting in the dirt now
No my lord that was me
I’m the one who  I’ll get right on that
followed you on your sad wanderings ever since your bad luck began
Nice to see you
It was me no one else
Everything is gloomy dark and dreadful
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair
Yes I think that’s true
He doesn’t know what he’s saying
Edmund is dead my lord
As for me I’m surrendering all my power over to him giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life
And my poor  He’s fainted My lord my lord
Don’t disturb his soul
Let it go up to heaven
Oh he’s really gone
What’s amazing is how long he lasted
Carry them away
Our business now is mourning and grief
Why are you hiding that letter
I don’t have any news to report my lord
What’s that paper you were reading
It’s nothing my lord
No
Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry
If it were nothing you wouldn’t need to hide it
Please sir I beg you
It’s a letter from my brother that I haven’t finished reading yet
Give me that letter sir
Now I’ll offend you whether I give it to you or not
The problem is in what the letter says as far as I can tell
I hope for my brother’s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor
I will have to go on a journey to death soon sir
My master’s calling me
I can’t say no
We must remember the gravity of this sad day
We should speak what we feel not what we ought to say
Come talk to me about this
If our father were dead you’d receive half of his revenue forever and you’d have my undying love      Edgar” Hmm what’s this a conspiracy
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart
How did you get this letter
Who delivered it
Nobody delivered it my lord
That’s what’s clever about it
It was tossed into the window of my room
You’re sure the handwriting is your brother’s
If he’d written nice things I’d swear yes right away
But as it stands I wish I could believe it wasn’t
But it is his handwriting
It’s his handwriting my lord but I hope he didn’t mean what he wrote
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before
Never my lord
But I’ve often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining the sons should be their fathers' guardians and manage their fathers' money
Oh what a villain
That’s just what he said in the letter
Evil villain
Go look for him
I’ll arrest him
Horrid villain
Where is he
I’m not sure my lord
I’ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you and for no other reason
Do you think so
He can’t possibly be such a monster  And I’m sure he isn’t
toward his own father who loves him so completely
Oh God
Edmund go find him
I’ll find him right away sir and carry out the business as well as I can
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us
Though science can explain them away disasters still come after eclipses
Love cools off friendships break up and brothers become enemies
break out civil war erupts kings are betrayed and the bond between father and son snaps
This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction  son against father
The king acts unnaturally father against child
We’ve seen the best our age has to offer
Conspiracies fakery betrayal and disorder are all that’s left until we die
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking Edmund
You won’t lose any respect
Just do it carefully And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished for the crime of telling the truth
It’s strange strange
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world when we’re down and out often because of our own excesses  we put all the blame on the sun the moon and the stars as if they forced us to be bad or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending and I was born under the Big Dipper so it’s inevitable that I’m rude and oversexed
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception
Fa sol la mi
Hello brother Edmund
What are you thinking about so seriously
How long have you believed in astrology
Come on
When was the last time you saw my father
Why last night
Did you speak to him
Yes we talked for a couple of hours
Did you leave on good terms
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you either in his words or his face
No none at all
Some villain has told lies about me
That’s what I’m afraid of
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little
In the meantime come home with me and when the time is right I’ll take you to talk to him
Please go
Here’s my key
If you go outside arm yourself
Arm myself
Brother I’m giving you good advice
Arm yourself
Now please go
Will I hear from you soon
I’ll help you through this business
A gullible father and a brother who’s so innocent that he can’t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him these are the two fools I need for my plan to work
I know exactly how to proceed
If I can’t have an estate by birthright then I’ll get it by being clever
Any trick that works is good for me
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool
Yes ma'am
He constantly offends me
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge
I won’t stand for it
His knights are getting out of control and he himself reprimands us about every little detail
When he comes back from hunting I’m not going to speak to him
Tell him I’m sick
And if you’re not as attentive in serving him as you used to be that’ll be good
I’ll take responsibility for it
He’s coming ma'am
I hear him
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him you and the other servants
If he doesn’t like it he can go live with my sister
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he’s given away
I swear old fools become like babies again
Remember what I’ve told you
Very well ma'am
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights
Don’t worry about the consequences
Tell your men as much
I want this to provoke confrontations so I can give him a piece of my mind
I’ll write to my sister and tell her my plans
Now go set up for dinner
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance then I’ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly
I love my master and he’ll find me very hard working
Don’t make me wait for dinner even a moment
Get it ready immediately
A man sir
What’s your profession
What do you want from me
But who are you
An honest guy who’s as poor as the king
If you’re as poor a subject as he is a king you definitely are poor
What do you want
To work as a servant
Who do you want to work for
You
Do you know me
Authority
What work can you do
I can be discreet in honorable matters ride a horse run tell a good story badly and deliver a plain message bluntly
I’m good at everything that ordinary men can do
The best thing about me is that I’m hardworking
How old are you
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason
I’m forty eight
Follow me
You’ll work for me
Where’s my fool Go call my fool and have him come here
No I don’t my lord
Very pleased to meet you my lord
I look forward to getting to know you better
I’ll try to make myself worth your knowledge
He’s been gone for nine years and he’s leaving again soon
The king is coming
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy Gloucester
Yes my lord
You sir where’s my daughter
I beg your pardon sir  What did that guy say
Call the numbskull back in here
Where’s my fool
You’d think everyone was asleep
So what’s going on
Where’s that dog
He says your daughter’s not feeling well my lord
Why didn’t the jerk come back to me when I called him
Sir he told me quite bluntly that he didn’t feel like it
Didn’t feel like it
My lord I don’t know what’s going on but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before
The servants the duke and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly
Huh
Do you really mean that
Please forgive me if I’m mistaken my lord but I can’t keep quiet when I think you’re being insulted
No you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed
I’ve felt neglected recently but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind
I’ll look into it further
But where’s my fool
I haven’t seen him for two days
Ever since Cordelia left for France sir the fool has been depressed
Let’s not talk about it
I’ve noticed it myself
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her
And you go call my fool
You there sir come here please
Who am I sir
You scoundrel
You lowlife son of a bitch
You dog you peasant
I won’t be hit my lord
Now my friendly servant thank you
Wait let me hire him too Here’s my fool’s cap a token of my gratitude
Well hello my good boy
How are you doing
Why Fool
Why
For standing up for this unpopular king
No if you can’t adjust to political changes you’ll suffer for it
There take my fool’s cap
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to
If you work for him you’re a fool and should wear a fool’s cap So how’s it going uncle
I wish I had two fool’s caps and two daughters
Why my boy
If I gave them all I own I’d have two fool’s caps for myself
Here’s mine
Ask your daughters for another one
Watch out boy remember I can whip you
A constant pain to me
I’ll recite something for you guy
Yes do that
Listen up uncle
Have more than you show Speak less than you know Lend less than you owe
It’s nothing
In that case it’s like the words of an unpaid lawyer
Why no boy
Nothing can be made out of nothing
You’re a bitter fool
Do you know the difference my boy between a bitter fool and a sweet one
No son
Tell me
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land
You can stand in his place
The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away
The sweet fool in a fool’s costume that’s me
The bitter one is the other one that’s youLEAR Are you calling me a fool boy
Well you’ve given away all your other rightful titles
No
Which two crowns would those be
Well when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns
If I’m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish
When did you become so fond of singing boy
I’ve been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power
That’s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down            Please uncle hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie
I want to learn how to lie
If you lie boy we’ll have you whipped
I’m amazed how similar you and your daughters are
They want to whip me for telling the truth you want to whip me for lying and sometimes I’m even whipped for keeping quiet
I’d rather be anything besides a fool
And yet I wouldn’t want to be you uncle
Here comes the owner of one piece
What’s going on daughter
Why are you frowning like that
I think you’ve been frowning too much recently
The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back
will damage your reputation with them and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre
However this is an extreme situation and it’s more important to control it than to worry about how you’ll look
You know uncle A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow’s head off
So the candle went out and now we’re all in the dark
Are you my daughter
Does anyone here know who I am
I’m not Lear
Where are his eyes
I don’t think so
Who can tell me who I am
You’re Lear’s shadow
Daughters who can make you obey them
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks
I’m asking you to understand my point of view
Since you’re old and respected you should be wise
But you’re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly vulgar and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel
They’re such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we’re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace
It’s shameful and we have to make some changes right away
Hell and damnation
Saddle up my horses
Call my knights together
You’re not really my daughter but I still have one daughter left
You hit my servants and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants
You’ll be sorry later but it’ll be too late
Ingratitude is always hideous but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster
Please sir be patient
That may be true my lord
Ah dear Nature my goddess listen to me
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her
This land will belong to your and Albany’s children forever And now what does my second daughter Regan the wife of Cornwall have to say
Tell me
Dear gods in heaven what’s the reason for this
And then you’ll see that despite what you thought I’ll be as powerful as I was before
You’ll see I promise you
Did you hear that
Goneril you know how much I love you but still I have to say  Shush please
Come sir no more Oswald come here
A fox you’ve trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered If my fool’s cap is worth a rope to bind them
So the fool follows you
My father can’t think straight a hundred knights
You may be exaggerating the risks
That’s better than exaggerating our trust
It’s always better to get rid of what you’re scared of than to be afraid
I know how his mind works
I’ve written to my sister telling her everything he’s said
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I’ve shown how inappropriately he’s behaved  Here ma'am
Well Oswald
Have you written that letter to my sister yet
Yes ma'am
Take some men and horses and go to her
Add details of your own to back up what I’m saying
Now go and hurry back
But people often screw things up trying to make them better
No not at all  All right all right
I won’t sleep until I’ve delivered your letter my lord
If a man’s brain were in his feet wouldn’t it be susceptible to frostbite
Yes boy
Ha ha ha
Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly you’ll see
Even though she’s as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another still… I know what I know
And what do you know boy
I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril both of them sour crabapples
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face
No
Why to keep the eyes on the sides so that you can see anything that you can’t sniff out
I was wrong to her  Do you know how an oyster makes its shell
No
Me neither
But I know why a snail carries its house on its back
Why
He can’t give his house away to his daughters leaving himself without shelter
I want to forget what I am
Such a kind father Are my horses ready
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready
There’s a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it
Because it doesn’t have eight
That’s right
You’d make a good fool
I could take back my crown by force What outrageous ingratitude
If you were my fool uncle I’d have you beaten for getting old before your time
How’s that
You’re not supposed to get old until you’re wise
Oh dear God don’t let me go mad
Keep me balanced and sane
I don’t want to go mad
They’re ready my lord
Come on boy
Hello Curan
Hello sir
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight
Why is that
I don’t know
You haven’t heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany
Not a word
You may hear about it soon
Goodbye sir
The duke will be here tonight
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan
Fast work and a little luck are all I need Brother could I have a word with you
Come down brother
Father is on the lookout
Get out of here quickly
It has leaked out that you’re hiding here
You haven’t said anything against the Duke of Cornwall have you
He’s rushing on his way here right now and Regan’s with him
Think about it
I hear my father coming
Forgive me
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword
Be convincing
Edmund where’s your wicked brother
Look sir I’m bleeding
Where is the villain Edmund
He ran out that way sir when he couldn’t  Follow him now
Go
When he couldn’t what
In short when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body cutting my arm
Bolstered by righteousness I prepared to fight and when he saw my excitement or perhaps because my shouting scared him he ran away suddenly
Let him run far away
If he stays in this country he’ll be found
The Duke of Cornwall my master and patron is arriving tonight
joy except my love for you and I find that only your majesty’s love makes me happy
Speak
Nothing my lord
Nothing
Nothing
Come on “nothing” will get you nothing
Try again
I don’t have a talent for putting my heart’s feelings into words
I love you as a child should love her father neither more nor less
What are you saying Cordelia
Revise your statement or you may damage your inheritance
justice will be rewarded
He answered “You penniless bastard
Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours anyone would believe you
No
I’d deny whatever evidence you had against me even if it were in my own handwriting and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn’t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me” Oh how monstrously evil
He said he would deny that he wrote his letter
The duke’s trumpets
I don’t know why he’s come here
I’ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors
The villain won’t escape
The duke will agree with me on that
How are you my friend
Ever since I arrived here just now I’ve been hearing strange rumors
How are you my lord
Oh madam my old heart is broken broken
Oh my lady I’m ashamed to admit it
Wasn’t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father
I don’t know madam
Oh it’s too terrible
To answer your question ma'am yes he was friendly with those knights
Then it’s no surprise they had a bad influence on him
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house
And I won’t be there either Edmund I’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father
I just did my duty sir
He exposed Edgar’s murderous plot and was wounded as you see there when trying to apprehend him
Are your men searching for him
Yes my lord
If he’s caught he’ll never make trouble for anyone again
I need people as trustworthy as you
I’ll always be loyal to you sir
You don’t know why we came to visit you  Yes and so unexpectedly at night
Their messengers are ready waiting to deliver our response in these matters
So please old friend give us some good advice
I’m at your service madam
Both of you are very welcome here
Good morning to you friend
Do you work in this house
Yes I do
Where should we stable our horses
In the mud
Please sir be kind to me and tell me
I won’t be kind to you
In that case I don’t much care for you either
If I could get my hands on you I’d make you care
Why are you talking to me like this
I don’t even know you
Ah but I know you
Who am I then
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don’t know and who doesn’t know you
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don’t know me
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king
Draw your sword scoundrel
I’ll make ground beef out of you
Get away from me
I’ve got nothing to do with you
Draw your sword you jerk
You come here with letters against the king and you take his conceited daughter’s side against his royal highness
Draw your sword scoundrel or I’ll slice your thighs like flank steak
Draw your sword
Come on
Help
Murderer
Help
Stand and fight you overdressed servant fight
Help
Murder murder
Macbeth
Then stay with us
There’s still a bit of daylight in the sky
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns
The rest of the king’s guests are already inside
That’s him
Prepare yourselves
It will rain tonight
Then let the rain come down
Oh this is treachery
Get out of here good Fleance run run run
Someday you can get revenge Oh you bastard
Who put out the light
Wasn’t that the best thing to do
There’s only one body here
The son ran away
We failed in half of our mission
Well let’s get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish
From the highest to the lowest of you I bid you a hearty welcome
Thanks to your majesty
I will walk around and mingle with all of you playing the humble host
Say welcome to all of our friends for me sir for in my heart they are all welcome
And they respond to you with their hearts as well
The table is full on both sides
I will sit here in the middle
Be free and happy
Soon we will toast around the table
Then it must be Banquo’s
My lord his throat is cut
I did that to him
You are the best of the cutthroats
If you cut both their throats then you are the absolute best
Most royal sir Fleance has escaped
Now I’m scared again
Otherwise I would have been perfect as solid as a piece of marble as firm as a rock as free as the air itself
Yes my good lord
He’s lying dead in a ditch with twenty deep gashes in his head any one of which would have been enough to kill him
Thanks for that
The adult snake lies in the ditch
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening but for now he has no fangs
Get out of here
I’ll talk to you again tomorrow
My royal lord you’re not entertaining the guests
When you just want to eat it’s better to do that at home
Where have you been sister
Killing pigs
And you sister
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them
Give me one” I said
Get away from me witch” the fat woman cried
How nice of you
And I will give you some more
I’ll drain the life out of him
He won’t catch a wink of sleep either at night or during the day
He will live as a cursed man
For eighty one weeks he will waste away in agony
It’s nice of you to remind me
Why don’t you have a seat your highness
His absence means he’s broken his promise sir
If it pleases you your highness why don’t you sit with us and grace us with your royal company
The table’s full
Here’s an empty seat sir
Where
What my good lord
Gentlemen stand up
His highness is not well
Sit down worthy friends
My husband is often like this and he has been since he was a child
Please stay seated
If you pay too much attention to him you’ll make him angry and that will make his convulsions go on longer
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him
Yes and a brave one who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil
Oh that’s nonsense
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid
These outbursts of yours don’t even look like real fear
They’re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother
Shame on you
Why are you making these faces
When the vision passes you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool
Please just look over there
Look
Look
As sure as I’m standing here I saw him
Nonsense
It used to be that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die and that would be it
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools
This haunting business is even stranger than murder
My worthy lord your noble friends miss your company
Too bad it’s spoiling our pleasure tonight
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear an armor plated rhinoceros or a tiger from Iran
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place
If I tremble then you can call me a little girl
Get out of here you horrible ghost you hallucination
Get out
I am a man again
Pray you sit still
Please remain seated
What things my lord
Please don’t speak to him
He’s getting worse and worse
Talk makes him crazy
Good night
A kind good night to all
Gravestones have been known to move and trees to speak to bring guilty men to justice
It’s almost morning
Did you send for him sir
I’ve heard about this indirectly but I will send for him
In every one of the lords' households I have a servant paid to spy for me
Tomorrow while it’s still early I will go see the witches
They will tell me more because I’m determined to know the worst about what’s going to happen
My own safety is the only important thing now
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them
Yes let’s go to sleep
My strange self delusions just come from inexperience
We’re still just beginners when it comes to crime
What’s wrong Hecate
You look angry
Don’t I have a reason to be angry you disobedient hags
But you can make it up to me
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny
You bring your cauldrons your spells your charms and everything else
I’m about to fly away
I’ll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen
I have a lot to do before noon
An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon
I’ll catch it before it falls to the ground
When I work it over with magic spells the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate he will mock death and he will think he is above wisdom grace and fear
As you all know overconfidence is man’s greatest enemy
Listen
I’m being called
Look my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me
All I’m saying is that strange things have been going on
Clearly men should not go out walking too late
And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father
Those are the things we pine for now
Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he’s preparing for war
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland
I’ll send my prayers with him
Although I can’t make his ship disappear I can still make his journey miserable
Look what I have here
Show me show me
A drum a drum
Macbeth has come
The tawny cat has meowed three times
My spirit friend Harpier is yelling “It’s time it’s time” Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble
We’ll cool the mixture with baboon blood
Well done
I admire your efforts and all of you will share the rewards
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies enchanting everything you put in
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs
Doors open up for whoever is knocking
What’s going on here you secret evil midnight hags
What are you doing
Something there isn’t a word for
Tell me what I want to know
Speak
Demand
We’ll answer
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master’s
Call them
Let me see them
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring
Tell me you unknown power  He can read your thoughts
Listen but don’t speak
Macbeth
Macbeth
Macbeth
Beware Macduff
Beware the thane of Fife
Let me go
Enough
Whatever you are thanks for your advice
You have guessed exactly what I feared
But one word more  He will not be commanded by you
Here’s another stronger than the first
Macbeth
If I had three ears I’d listen with all three
Be violent bold and firm
Laugh at the power of other men because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth
But even so I’ll make doubly sure
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head
Listen but don’t speak to it
Be brave like the lion and proud
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill
That will never happen
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth
These were sweet omens
Good
My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves and I will be king for my entire natural life
But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing
Tell me if your dark powers can see this far will Banquo’s sons ever reign in this kingdom
Don’t try to find out more
I demand to be satisfied
If you refuse let an eternal curse fall on you
Let me know
Why is that cauldron sinking
And what is that music
Show
Show
Show
Show him and make him grieve
Come like shadows and depart in the same way
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo
Go away     
What
Is this true
Come sisters let’s cheer him up and show him our talents
Where are they
Gone
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed
What does your grace want
Did you see the weird sisters
No my lord
Didn’t they pass by you
No indeed my lord
I heard the galloping of horses
Who was it that came here
Two or three men my lord who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England
Fled to England
Yes my good lord
Time you thwart my dreadful plans
No more foolish talk
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose
But no more spooky visions Where are the messengers
Come bring me to them
What did he do that made him flee this land
You have to be patient madam
He had no patience
He was crazy to run away
Even if you’re not a traitor you’re going to look like one if you run away
You don’t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee
How could it be wisdom
To leave his wife his children his house and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it
Even the fragile wren the smallest of birds will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love
My dearest relative I’m begging you pull yourself together
As for your husband he is noble wise and judicious and he understands what the times require
I’ll say good bye now
It won’t be long before I’m back
When things are at their worst they have to stop or else improve to the way things were before
He has a father and yet he is fatherless
If I stay longer I’ll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying
I’m leaving now
Young man your father’s dead
What are you going to do now
How are you going to live
What
Are you going to start eating worms and flies
I mean I will live on whatever I get like birds do
You’d be a pitiful bird
You wouldn’t know enough to be afraid of traps
No matter what you say my father is not dead
Yes he is dead
What are you going to do for a father
Maybe you should ask what will you do for a husband
Oh I can buy twenty husbands at any market
Speak if you can
All hail Macbeth
Hail to you thane of Glamis
All hail Macbeth
Hail
Hail
Hail
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater
You are not as happy as Macbeth yet much happier
Your descendants will be kings even though you will not be one
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
If so you’d be buying them to sell again
You talk like a child but you’re very smart anyway
Was my father a traitor Mother
Yes he was
What is a traitor
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged
Everyone
Who should hang them
The honest men
Then the liars are fools for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them
If he were dead you’d be weeping for him
If you aren’t weeping it’s a good sign that I’ll soon have a new father
Silly babbler how you talk
Bless you fair lady
You don’t know me but I know you’re an important person
I’m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you
If you’ll take a simple man’s advice don’t be here when it arrives
Go away and take your children
I feel bad for scaring you like this but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm
And harm is getting close
Heaven keep you safe
Where should I go
I haven’t done anything wrong
But I have to remember that I’m here on Earth where doing evil is often praised and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I’m innocent
Who are these men
Where is your husband
I hope he’s not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him
He’s a traitor
You’re lying you shaggy haired villain
What’s that you runt
He has killed me Mother
Run away I beg you
Let’s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out
Instead of crying let’s keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men
Each day new widows howl new orphans cry and new sorrows slap heaven in the face until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland’s anguish and screams in pain
What you just said may perhaps be true
This tyrant whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it was once considered an honest man
You were one of his favorites
He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth
I am not treacherous
But Macbeth is
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command
But I beg your pardon
My fears can’t actually make you evil
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer the brightest angel fell from heaven
Even though everything evil wants to look good good still has to look good too
Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable the most precious things in your life those strong bonds of love
But I beg you don’t interpret my suspicions as slander against you
You may really be honest no matter what I think
Bleed bleed poor country
I wouldn’t be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth’s kingdom and the riches of the East too
Don’t be offended
I don’t completely distrust you
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth’s oppression
Our country weeps it bleeds and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds
The English have promised me thousands of troops
Who are you talking about
Even in hell you couldn’t find a devil worse than Macbeth
I admit that he’s murderous lecherous greedy lying deceitful violent malicious and guilty of every sin that has a name
But there is no end absolutely none to my sexual desires
Your wives your daughters your old women and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me
Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind of tyranny
It has caused the downfall of many kings
But don’t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you
There are more than enough willing women around
Greed has been the downfall of many kings
But I don’t have any good sides
No if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell
Oh Scotland Scotland
If someone like me is fit to be king let me know
I’m still a virgin
Indeed before you arrived here old Siward with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle was making his way here
Why are you silent
It’s hard to make sense of such different stories
Well we’ll speak more soon
Yes sir
Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine but when he touches them they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven
Thank you doctor
What disease is he talking about
It’s called the evil
Edward’s healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England
Along with this strange power he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities
Who’s that coming over here
By his dress I can tell he’s my countryman but I don’t recognize him
My noble kinsman welcome
Hello sir
Is Scotland the same as when I left it
Alas our poor country
It’s too frightened to look at itself
Oh your report is too poetic but it sounds so true
Banquo and Macbeth all hail
Stay and tell me more
Tell me where you learned these strange things and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting
Speak I command you
The earth has bubbles just like the water and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth
Where did they disappear to
I wish they had stayed
Were these things we’re talking about really here
Or are we both on drugs
Your children will be kings
You will be the king
Isn’t that what they said
That’s exactly what they said
Who’s this
How is my wife
She’s well
And all my children
They’re well too
What’s the news
Now is the time when we need your help
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own
What is this news about
If it’s for me don’t keep it from me
Let me have it now
I think I can guess what you’re about to say
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered
Merciful heaven
They killed my children too
They killed your wife your children your servants anyone they could find
And I had to be away
My wife was killed too
I said she was
Take comfort
He doesn’t have children
All my pretty little children
Did you say all
Oh that bird from hell
All of them
What all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop
Fight it like a man
I can’t help remembering the things that were most precious to me
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help
Sinful Macduff they were killed because of you
As wicked as I am they were slaughtered because of me not because of anything they did
May God give their souls rest
Let this anger sharpen your sword
Transform your grief into anger
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them
But gentle heavens don’t keep me waiting
Bring me face to face with Macbeth that devil of Scotland
Put him within the reach of my sword and if he escapes may heaven forgive him as well
Now you sound like a man
Come on let’s go see King Edward
The army is ready
Macbeth is ripe for the picking
Cheer up as much as you can
I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now and I haven’t seen any evidence of what you were talking about
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking
Since Macbeth went to war I have seen her rise from her bed put on her nightgown unlock her closet take out some paper fold it write on it read it seal it up and then return to bed remaining asleep the entire time
When she is like this besides walking and performing various activities have you heard her say anything
She says something sir but I will not repeat it to you
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else because there was no one else to witness her speech
Look here she comes
This is exactly how she always looks and I swear it she is fast asleep
Watch her
How did she get that candle
It stands by her bedside
She always has to have a light next to her
Those are her orders
You see her eyes are open
Yes but they don’t see anything
What’s she doing now
Look how she rubs her hands
She looks like she’s washing her hands
There’s still a spot here
Listen
She’s talking
I’ll write down what she says so I’ll remember it better
Did you hear that
The thane of Fife had a wife
Where is she now What will my hands never be clean No more of that my lord no more of that
You’ve heard something you shouldn’t have
She said something she shouldn’t have said I’m sure of that
Heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping
I still have the smell of blood on my hand
All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better
Oh oh oh
What a heavy sigh
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight
I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen
Well well well
I hope what she’s saying is well sir
This disease is beyond my medical skills
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything
Wash your hands
Put on your nightgown
Is this true
To bed to bed
There’s a knocking at the gate
Will she go to bed now
Yes right away
Unnatural acts will cause  Good night good doctor
The English army is near led by Malcolm his uncle Siward and the good Macduff
They burn for revenge
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother
He is definitely not there sir
I have a list of all the important men
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses
One thing is certain he’s out of control
Who can blame him for acting crazy when inside he condemns himself for everything he’s done
Let’s proceed on our march to Birnam
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway and that you weren’t the least bit afraid of death even as you killed everyone around you
Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him
Why are you giving me his title
I don’t know whether he fought on Norway’s side or if he secretly aided the rebels or if he fought with both of our enemies
Don’t bring me any more reports
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane I won’t be affected by fear
What’s the boy Malcolm
Wasn’t he born from a woman
The spirits that know the future have told me this “Don’t be afraid Macbeth
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you” So get out of here disloyal thanes and join the weak and decadent English
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear
May the devil turn you black you white faced fool
Why do you look like a frightened goose
There are ten thousand  Geese you idiot
Soldiers sir
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face you cowardly boy
What soldiers fool
Curse you
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well
What soldiers milk face
The English army sir
Get out of my sight
Seyton I’m sick at heart when I see Seyton come here This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne
I have lived long enough
Seyton
What do you want
Is there more news
All the rumors have been confirmed
I’ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones
Give me my armor
You don’t need it yet
I’ll put it on anyway
Send out more cavalry
Give me my armor
She is not sick my lord but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping
Cure her of that
For that kind of relief the patient must heal herself
Medicine is for the dogs
I won’t have anything to do with it
Yes my good lord
Your preparation for war sounds like something
Kinsmen I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms
We don’t doubt it
What’s the name of this forest behind us
Birnam Wood
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him
That way we can conceal how many of us there are and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports
We’ll do it
We shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our goal
Hang our flags on the outer walls
Everyone keeps yelling “Here they come” Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease
If it weren’t for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them we could have met them out in front of the castle man to man and beaten them back to England
What’s that noise
It’s women crying my good lord
I’ve almost forgotten what fear feels like
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story
What was that cry for
The queen is dead my lord
She would have died later anyway
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Out out brief candle
Life is a story told by an idiot full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning
My gracious lord I should tell you what I saw but I don’t know how to say it
Just say it
As I was standing watch on the hill I looked toward Birnam and I thought I saw the forest begin to move
Liar and slave
Punish me if it’s not true
Three miles from here you can see it coming a moving forest
If you’re lying I’ll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger
If what you say is true you can do the same to me
We’re close enough now
Good luck
If we meet Macbeth’s army tonight let us be beaten if we cannot fight
They have me tied to a stake
I can’t run away
You’ll be afraid to hear it
No I won’t even if you were one of the worst demons in hell
My name’s Macbeth
The devil himself couldn’t say a name I hate more
No nor could the devil’s name be more frightening
You lie you disgusting tyrant
I’ll prove with my sword that I’m not scared of you
You were born from a woman
Swords don’t frighten me
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman
But this whole thing is strange
The noise is coming from over there
Tyrant show your face
I’ll either fight you Macbeth or else I’ll put down my sword unused
You must be over there
Come this way my lord
Our noblemen are battling bravely
Sir enter the castle
Turn around you dog from hell turn around
But go away now
I have nothing to say to you
My sword will talk for me
You are too evil for words
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword
I lead a charmed life which can’t be ended by anyone born from a woman
I won’t fight you
Then surrender coward and we’ll put you in a freakshow just like they do with deformed animals
We’ll put a picture of you on a sign right above the words “Come see the tyrant” I’m not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm or be taunted by the common people
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane and I’m fighting a man not of woman born I’ll fight to the end
I’ll put up my shield and battle you
Come on let’s go at it Macduff and damn the first man who cries 'Stop
Enough
Macduff is missing and so is your noble son
My lord your son has paid the soldier’s price death
He only lived long enough to become a man and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one he died
So he’s dead
Yes and he’s been carried off the field
Your grief should not be equal to his worth because then your sorrow would never end
Were his wounds on his front side
Yes on his front
Well then he’s God’s soldier now
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head I couldn’t hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did
And that’s all there is to it
He is worth more mourning than that and I will mourn for him
He is worth no more than that
They tell me he died well and settled his scores
With that I hope God is with him
Here comes better news
Hail king
Because that’s what you are now
Look here I have Macbeth’s cursed head
We are free from his tyranny
Hail King of Scotland
My thanes and kinsmen I name you all earls the first earls that Scotland has ever had
So I thank you all and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone
Look at Macbeth he’s in a daze
Good Macbeth we’re ready when you are
Kind gentlemen I won’t forget the trouble you’ve taken for me whenever I think of this day
Let’s go to the king
Absolutely
Until then we’ve said enough
My king they haven’t come back yet
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons begged your highness’s forgiveness and repented deeply
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage
There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking at his face
You are welcome here
With that I’ll be off
My worthy Cawdor
When should the three of us meet again
Will it be in thunder lightning or rain
That will happen before sunset
Where should we meet
We’ll meet Macbeth there
When I tried desperately to question them further they vanished into thin air
While I stood spellbound messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’the future king
What news do you bring
The king is coming here tonight
You must be crazy to say that
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message
Take good care of him
He brings great news
My dearest love Duncan is coming here tonight
And when is he leaving
He plans to leave tomorrow
That day will never come
Your face betrays strange feelings my lord and people will be able to read it like a book
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes your hands and your words
You should look like an innocent flower but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower
We will speak about this further
Leave all the rest to me
This castle is in a pleasant place
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses
The fact that this summer bird the house martin builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are
There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed
I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest
Look here comes our honored hostess
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient but I still accept it as love
Fair and noble hostess we are your guests tonight
We are your servants your highness and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal for after all we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours
Give me your hand
Bring me to my host Macbeth
I love him dearly and I shall continue to favor him
Whenever you’re ready hostess
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed then it would be best to get it over with quickly
What news do you have
He has almost finished dinner
Why did you leave the dining room
Has he asked for me
Don’t you know he has
We can’t go on with this plan
The king has just honored me and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before
From now on this is what I’ll think of your love
Are you afraid to act the way you desire
You’re like the poor cat in the old story
If you weren’t a man then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this
And whatever we do we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants
May you only give birth to male children because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine
Once we have covered the two servants with blood and used their daggers to kill won’t people believe that they were the culprits
Go now and pretend to be a friendly hostess
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false evil heart
How’s the night going boy
The moon has set
The clock hasn’t struck yet
The moon sets at twelve right
I think it’s later than that sir
Here take my sword
The heavens are being stingy with their light
Take this too
I’m tired and feeling heavy but I can’t sleep
Merciful powers keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest
Give me my sword
Who’s there
A friend
You’re not asleep yet sir
The king’s in bed
He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality
Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to
Who is this bloody man
Judging from his appearance I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured
Hail brave friend
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it
The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water unable to move
My brave relative
What a worthy man
Everything’s OK
I had a dream last night about the three witches
I don’t think about them now
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it if you’re willing
Whenever you like
If you stick with me when the time comes there will be something in it for you
Rest easy in the meantime
Thank you sir
You do the same
Is this a dagger I see in front of me with its handle pointing toward my hand
I’m going now
Don’t listen to the bell Duncan because it summons you either to heaven or to hell
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up
Listen
Quiet
My husband
I have done the deed
Did you hear a noise
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
Didn’t you say something
When
Just now
As I came down
Yes
Listen
Who’s sleeping in the second chamber
Donalbain
That’s a stupid thing to say
One servant cried “God bless us” and the other replied “Amen” as if they had seen my bloody hands
Listening to their frightened voices I couldn’t reply “Amen” when they said “God bless us” Don’t think about it so much
But why couldn’t I say “Amen”
I desperately needed God’s blessing but the word “Amen” stuck in my throat
We can’t think that way about what we did
If we do it’ll drive us crazy
I thought I heard a voice cry “Sleep no more
What are you talking about
The voice kept crying “Sleep no more” to everyone in the house
Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room
They have to stay there
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood
Coward
Give me the daggers
Only children are afraid of scary pictures
If Duncan bleeds I’ll paint the servants' faces with his blood
Where is that knocking coming from
What’s happening to me that I’m frightened of every noise
I hear someone knocking at the south entry
Let’s go back to our bedroom
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt
It’s so simple
You’ve lost your resolve
Listen
There’s more knocking
Put on your nightgown in case someone comes and sees that we’re awake
Snap out of your daze
Wake Duncan with your knocking
I wish you could
Knock knock knock
Knock knock
Who’s there in the other devil’s name
Come on in con man
Knock knock knock
Who’s there
Maybe it’s an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people’s clothes
Come on in tailor
You can heat your iron up in here
Knock knock
Never a moment of peace
Who are you
Ah this place is too cold to be hell
I won’t pretend to be the devil’s porter anymore
I’m coming I’m coming
Please don’t forget to leave me a tip
Did you go to bed so late my friend that you’re having a hard time getting up now
What three things does drink make a man do
It sets you up for a fall
It persuades you and discourages you
I believe drink did all of this to you last night
Is your master awake
Our knocking woke him up
Here he comes
Good morning noble sir
Good morning to both of you
Is the king awake worthy thane
Not yet
He commanded me to wake him up early
I’ve almost missed the time he requested
I’ll bring you to him
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble but that doesn’t mean it’s not a trouble just the same
The work we enjoy is not really work
This is the door
I’ll wake him because that’s my job
Is the king leaving here today
He is
He told us to arrange it
The night has been chaotic
The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping
The owl made noise all night
Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever
It was a rough night
I’m too young to remember anything like it
Oh horror horror horror
This is beyond words and beyond belief
What’s the matter
The worst thing imaginable has happened
The life”
Do you mean the king
Listen to this King as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons
Didn’t this frighten our captains Macbeth and Banquo
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles or rabbits frighten a lion
To tell you the truth they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition
Your words like your wounds bring you honor
Take him to the surgeons
Who is this
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself
Don’t ask me to talk about it
Go look and then do the talking yourselves
Wake up wake up
Ring the alarm bell
Murder and treason
Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm
Wake up
Shake off sleep which looks like death and look at death itself
Get up get up and look at this image of doomsday
Malcolm
Banquo
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror
Speak up and tell me
If I repeated it to you it would kill you as soon as you heard it
Oh Banquo Banquo the king has been murdered
How horrible
What in our own house
Dear Macduff I beg you tell us you were lying and say it isn’t so
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life
Everything is a sick joke
The graceful and renowned king is dead
The wine of life has been poured out and only the dregs remain
What’s wrong
You are but you don’t know it yet
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped
Your royal father is murdered
Who did it
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood
So were their daggers which we found on their pillows unwiped
They stared at us in confusion
No one’s life should have been entrusted to them
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them
What did you do that for
Is it possible to be wise bewildered calm furious loyal and neutral all at once
Then right next to him I saw the murderers dripping with blood their daggers rudely covered in gore
Who could have restrained himself who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it
Help me out of here quickly
Take care of the lady
Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts
I’m putting myself in God’s hands and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder
So will I
So will we all
Let’s get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall
Agreed
What are you going to do
Let’s not stay here with them
It’s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none
I’m going to England
I’ll go to Ireland
We’ll both be safer if we go separate ways
Wherever we go men will smile at us while hiding daggers
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us
We haven’t yet encountered that danger and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely
There’s good reason to escape when there’s no mercy to be found anymore
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things
The clock says it’s daytime but dark night is strangling the sun
They say the horses ate each other
I saw it with my own eyes
Here comes the good Macduff
How are things going now
Can’t you see for yourself
The servants Macbeth killed
They were paid to betray their master
Malcolm and Donalbain the king’s two sons have run away and fled which makes them the prime suspects
Everything about this is unnatural
Then it looks like Macbeth will become king
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned
Where is Duncan’s body
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors where their bones are kept safe
Are you going to Scone
No cousin I’m going to Fife
Well I’ll go to Scone
I hope things go well there
Good bye
Farewell old man
May God’s blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good and enemies into friends
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead
If the witches tell the truth which they did about you maybe what they said about me will come true too
But shhh
I’ll shut up now
Whatever your highness commands me to do it is always my duty to do it
Are you going riding this afternoon
Yes my good lord
We would have liked to have heard your good advice which has always been serious and helpful at the council today but we’ll wait until tomorrow
Are you riding far
I’m going far enough that I’ll be riding from now until dinner
Unless my horse goes faster than expected I will be back an hour or two after sunset
Don’t miss our feast
My lord I won’t miss it
But we can talk more about that tomorrow when we’ll discuss matters of state that concern us both
Hurry up and get to your horse
Good bye until you return tonight
Is Fleance going with you
Yes my good lord
It’s time we hit the road
Farewell
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight
In order to make your company even more enjoyable I’m going to keep to myself until suppertime
Until then God be with you
Bring them to me
I’m very afraid of Banquo
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely
I’m not afraid of anyone but him
Then like prophets they named him the father to a line of kings
Who’s there
God save the king
Great happiness
So now Sweno the Norwegian king wants a treaty
We told him we wouldn’t even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme’s Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars
Go announce that he will be executed and tell Macbeth that Cawdor’s titles will be given to him
I’ll get it done right away
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you
Wasn’t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other
It was yesterday your highness
Well did you think about what I said
I explained how you were deceived how you were thwarted the things that were used against you who was working against you and a lot of other things that would convince even a half wit or a crazy person to say “Banquo did it” You explained it all
I did that and more which brings me to the point of this second meeting
Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going to let him off the hook
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever
We are men my lord
Just as hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels mutts shaggy lapdogs swimming dogs and wolf dog crossbreeds are all dogs
It’s the same with men
Now if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom tell me
Because if that’s the case I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me
You both know Banquo was your enemy
It’s true my lord
We’ll do what you want us to my lord
Though our lives    We have decided my lord
We’re in
I’ll call for you soon
Stay inside
The deal is closed
Banquo if your soul is going to make it to heaven tonight’s the night
Has Banquo left the court
Yes madam but he’ll be back tonight
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes
No problem madam
If you get what you want and you’re still not happy you’ve spent everything and gained nothing
It’s better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety
What’s going on my lord
What’s done is done
We have slashed the snake but not killed it
It will heal and be as good as new and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once again
We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace
After that nothing can hurt him further not weapons poison rebellion invasion or anything else
Come on relax dear
That’s exactly what I’ll do my love and I hope you’ll do the same
You have to stop talking like this
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive
That’s comforting
So be cheerful
Before the bat flies through the castle and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it’s nighttime a dreadful deed will be done
What are you going to do
He who chooses me will get what many men want” What many men want that “many” could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy
So I won’t choose what many men desire because I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population
So I guess it’s you you silver treasure house
Tell me once more what you say
He who chooses me will get what he deserves” That’s nicely put because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves
No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve
Oh wouldn’t it be great if property rank official positions and other honors were earned only by merit not by corruption
How many people who are humble now would be great then
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants
Well let me get back to my choice
He who chooses me will get what he deserves” I’ll assume I deserve the very best Give me a key for this one
You thought about it too long considering what you found there
What’s this
I’ll read it It looks so unlike Portia
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves”
Didn’t I deserve anything more than a fool’s head
Is this my prize
Don’t I deserve more than this
What does this say
This box was tested in the fire seven times
Some people kiss shadows
They only feel the shadow of joy
This choice was as foolish as they are
Take whatever wife you want to bed with you You’ll have a fool’s head forever
So go away
I came here with a fool’s head on my shoulders and now I’m leaving with two Goodbye sweet lady
I’ll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger
This is how the candle burned the moth
Oh these fools
When they choose they only know how to lose
You know what they say
Destiny chooses when you’ll die and who you’ll marry
Come on close the curtain Nerissa
Where’s lady Portia
Here
How can I help you sir
I haven’t seen such a promising candidate for your love
Please don’t tell me any more
Come on Nerissa I want to go see this man who’s come so courteously
So what’s the news on the Rialto
But it’s true I don’t want to get all mushy and go on and on but the good Antonio the honest Antonio oh if I only had a title good enough to match his  Come on get to the point
What are you saying
Well the point is he’s lost a ship
I hope that’s all he loses
Let me say “amen” quickly before the devil comes in and stops my prayer because here comes the devil disguised as a Jew
How’s it going Shylock
What’s the news among the merchants
You knew no one knew no one knew as well as you did about my daughter’s plans to run away
That’s true
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off
She’ll be damned for it
That’s true if the devil’s judging her
My own flesh and blood turned against me
A rebel
No
Your  I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood
But tell us did you hear anything about Antonio’s loss at sea
All right we’ll see you at dinnertime
I must be one of these silent so called wise men Gratiano’s talking about because he never lets me get a word in
If you hang around me for two more years you’ll forget the sound of your own voice
Goodbye
Thank you
Is he right
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice
You promised to tell me
That’s another bad deal I’ve made a bankrupt a spendthrift who now has to hide his head on the Rialto a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants
Let him think about his own debt
He liked to call me a loan shark let him think about his debt to me
He used to lend money as a favor between Christians but now let him think about his own debt
But you won’t take his flesh if he can’t pay
What’s that good for
I’ll use it for fish bait
He’s laughed at my losses made fun of my earnings humiliated my race thwarted my deals turned my friends against me riled up my enemies and why
Because I’m a Jew
Doesn’t a Jew have eyes
Doesn’t a Jew have hands bodily organs a human shape five senses feelings and passions
Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food get hurt with the same weapons get sick with the same diseases get healed by the same medicine and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian
If you prick us with a pin don’t we bleed
If you tickle us don’t we laugh
If you poison us don’t we die
And if you treat us badly won’t we try to get revenge
If we’re like you in everything else we’ll resemble you in that respect
If a Jew offends a Christian what’s the Christian’s kind and gentle reaction
Revenge
We’ve been looking for him everywhere
Here comes another Jew
You couldn’t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew
Hello Tubal
Any news from Genoa
Did you find my daughter
I went to many places where I heard news about her but I couldn’t find her
Oh oh oh
I never felt it until now two thousand ducats in that diamond and other precious precious jewels
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels
I wish she were in her coffin here with the ducats in her coffin
You couldn’t find out anything about them
Why
I don’t even know how much I’m spending to find them
Loss upon loss
Well other men have bad luck too
Antonio as I heard in Genoa  What what what
Bad luck bad luck
He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis
Thank God thank God
Is it true is it true
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck
Thank you Tubal
Good news good news
Ha ha heard in Genoa
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night
Oh you’re sticking a dagger in me
I’ll never see my gold again
Eighty ducats in one shot
Eighty ducats
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt
I’m very glad about that
I’ll hound him
I’ll torture him
I’m very glad
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey
Damn her
You’re torturing me Tubal
That was my turquoise ring
Leah gave it to me before we were married
I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys
But Antonio’s certainly ruined
That’s true that’s very true
With him out of Venice I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money Go Tubal
Meet me at the synagogue
Let me choose now
I feel tortured by all this talking
Tortured
They’re as opposite as hot and cold
Promise me you’ll let me live and I’ll confess the truth
All right then confess and live
Confess and love” is more like it
But let me try my luck on the boxes
Go ahead then
I’m locked in one of them
If you really love me you’ll find me Nerissa and the rest of you get away from him
Play some music while he chooses
Then if he loses it’ll be his swan song music before the end
What music should we play then
We’ve all come out to see what will happen Go Hercules
If you survive I’ll live
I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself
Ding dong bell
How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars the god of war
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful
A lovely cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark skinned beauty
So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box it’s like the gold that Midas couldn’t eat
Since this prize is yours Be happy with it and don’t look for a new one
If you’re happy with what you’ve won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny Then turn to where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss”
A nice message
My lady with your permission this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss
And so beautiful lady I’m standing here just like that wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is
You see me standing here Lord Bassanio
Though I wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer just so you might value me more so my good qualities beauty possessions and friends would be more than you could calculate
I’m even happier that I’m not stupid and I can learn
I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now my lord my king and you can guide me as you wish
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion master of these servants and queen over myself
But as of right this second all these things are yours
With this ring I give them all to you
Please let me know your plan Bassanio
As long as it’s honorable you can be sure that I’ll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you
Back when I was a schoolboy if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first
By risking the second arrow I’d often get both of them back
I’m telling you this story for a reason
I owe you a lot and like a spoiled kid I’ve lost what I owe you
But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time
Just tell me what to do and I’ll do it
Tell me
If you see me without it you can be confident I’m dead
Now we can shout “Congratulations congratulations my lord and lady” My Lord Bassanio and my dear lady I wish you all the joy I can wish for
And when you get married I hope I can be married at the same time
Absolutely if you can find a wife by then
I think I’ve found one already thanks to you my lord
And do you mean what you’re saying Gratiano
Yes my lord
Hey if I lay down my “ Welcome Lorenzo and Salerio
I do too my lord
They’re entirely welcome
That’s true and with good reason
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio
Before I open this letter please tell me how my good friend is doing
He’s not sick my lord but he’s very upset and his problems are serious
His letter will tell you how he’s doing
I wish you’d won the  Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale
Some good friend of his must have died because nothing else in the world could change a man so much
What does the news only get worse Please Bassanio I’m half of you so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you
Oh Portia these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper
My darling when I gave my love to you I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins that I have noble blood but no money
When I said that I told you the truth
But my dear when I said I was worth nothing I was actually bragging I should’ve said that I was worse than nothing
Have all his business ventures failed
Not even one success
Not one my lord
Anyway even if he had the money now the Jew probably wouldn’t take it
I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man
He’s at the duke’s morning and night accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush his countrymen that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed
And I know that unless the law intervenes it’ll be bad news for poor Antonio
Is this your good friend who’s in so much trouble
How much does he owe the Jew
Three thousand ducats
What that’s all
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt
I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over
When it’s paid bring your friend back
Until you get back Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows
Put on a happy face and welcome your friends
But let me hear the letter from your friend
Dear Bassanio my ships have all been wrecked
My creditors are getting mean
My money’s almost run out
I couldn’t pay my debt to the Jew on the due date
In any case do what you want
If your affection for me doesn’t convince you to come don’t let my letter do so” Oh my darling make your arrangements and go
Since you’re letting me leave I’ll hurry
But I won’t sleep till I get back
Jailer watch out for this one
This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest
Jailer keep an eye on him
Listen to me good Shylock
I’m going to get my  Please listen to me
I want my bond
I won’t listen to you
I want my bond so stop talking
I won’t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers
Don’t follow me
I’m not talking with you
I want my bond
He’s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans
Leave him alone
I won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore
He wants me dead
I know the real reason
I’ve often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him
That’s why he hates me
I’m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced
So go
I’ve lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow Well jailer let’s go I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt
Lorenzo please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back
Madam with all my heart
I’ll do anything you ask
They’ll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself
So goodbye until we meet again
Goodbye Jessica
Now Balthazar you’ve always been honest and faithful to me and I trust you still are
Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me
Her name is Portia
I’ll meet you at the ferry
I’ll go as fast as I can madam
Come on Nerissa I have many things to do that you don’t even know about yet
We’ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us
Will they see us
They will Nerissa but we’ll be disguised as men
I’ll tell twenty lies like that so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago
I know a thousand immature tricks like that and I’ll use them all
Why are we turning to men
What kind of question is that
Here I’ll tell you my whole plan in my carriage which is waiting for us at the gate
So hurry up because we have twenty miles to cover today
Yes look it’s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers
That’s why I’m worried about you
I’ve always been straightforward with you so now I’m telling you what I think
Cheer up because I think you’re going to hell
There’s only one hope for you and even that’s a kind of illegitimate hope
What hope is that may I ask
You can hope your father isn’t your real father
That really is an illegitimate hope
Then I’d be punished for the sins of my mother
In that case I’m afraid you’re damned by both your father and your mother
When you avoid one trap you fall into another
You’re in trouble either way
My husband will save me
He’s made me a Christian
He was wrong to do that
There were enough Christians before as many of them as could stand to live near each other
All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up
If we’re all pork eaters we won’t be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon even if we’ve got the money for it
I’ll tell my husband what you’ve said Launcelot
Here he comes
You’re going to make me jealous Launcelot if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this
No you don’t need to worry about us Lorenzo
Launcelot and I can’t agree on anything
He says I won’t get into heaven because I’m a Jew’s daughter and he says you’re irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you’re raising the price of pork
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia’s African servant
The  It’s too bad there’s more of the Moor than there ought to be
I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do
That’s already been done sir
They’re all ready to eat dinner
Good Lord what a clown you are
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once
About the table sir dinner will be served on it
As for the food it will be served in covered dishes
As for your coming in to dinner just do what you feel is right
Oh he’s good at bending words around
Anyway how are you Jessica
And how do you like Lord Bassanio’s wife
I like her more than I can say
And if he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth he’ll never deserve it in heaven
The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal
As good a wife as she is that’s how good a husband I am to you
First let’s go to dinner
No let me say some good things about you while I’m in the mood
No please save it for dinner conversation
Is Antonio here
Yes sir I’m here
I feel sorry for you
You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy an inhuman wretch incapable of pity without any feelings of mercy
They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what he’s doing
I’m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger
One of you go call the Jew into court here
He’s standing ready outside the door
Here he comes my lord
We all expect a nice answer from you Jew
I’ve told you what I intend to do and I’ve sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract
If you refuse to allow me to do so your city’s charter and its freedom are endangered
You’re going to ask me why I’d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats
I won’t answer that
Is that enough of an answer
What if I had a rat in my house and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated
Do you have your answer yet
Some men don’t like roast pig others go crazy if they see a cat and others can’t help urinating when they hear bagpipes
So to answer your question
It doesn’t excuse your cruel behavior
I don’t have to give you answers that you like
Does everyone kill what they don’t love
What would you let a snake bite you twice
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart
I would choose to take my penalty
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself when you don’t give any now
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven’t done anything wrong
Many of you own slaves which like your donkeys and dogs and mules you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them
Should I say to you “Set them free
Let them marry your children
Why are you making them work so hard
Let their beds be as soft as yours and let them eat the same food as you”
No you’d answer “The slaves are ours” And that’s just how I’m answering you
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive
It’s mine and I’m going to get it
If you refuse me the laws of Venice have no validity
I await justice
Oh Nerissa my poor little body is tired of this great big world
But as far as I can tell people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing
The best way to be happy is to be in between
Good point and well said
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches
But thinking like this won’t help me choose a husband
Isn’t it a pain that I can’t choose or refuse anyone Nerissa
I have the authority to dismiss this court unless Bellario comes today
Bring us the letters
Call the messenger in
Cheer up Antonio
Keep up your courage man
I’ll give the Jew my flesh blood bones and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me
I’m like the one sick sheep in the flock the one who deserves to die
The weakest fruit drops to the ground first so let me drop
Bassanio the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone
Have you come from Bellario’s office in Padua
Yes my lord
Bellario sends his greetings
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there
You’re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul you cruel Jew
No metal not even the executioner’s axe could ever be half as sharp as your hatred
Can’t any prayers reach your heart
No none that you’re smart enough to make
You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies
That’s why your desires are wolfish bloody and ravenous
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract you’re just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud
Be quiet boy or you’ll lose your mind
I stand here with the law on my side
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well educated legal expert
Where is he
He’s waiting nearby to find out if you’ll invite him in
With all my heart Three or four of you go welcome him In the meantime I’ll read Bellario’s letter out loud
His name is Balthazar
I leave him to you
Did old Bellario send you here
Yes my lord
Welcome
Please have a seat
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court
Yes thoroughly
Antonio and Shylock both of you come forward
Is your name Shylock
Shylock is my name
Your case is most unusual though the Venetian law can’t stop you from proceeding  Yes so he says
Do you acknowledge the contract
Yes I do
Then the Jew must show you mercy
Why do I have to do that
Tell me
No one shows mercy because he has to
It just happens the way gentle rain drops on the ground
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it
It’s strongest in the strongest people
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him
Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice
If you pursue it this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there
I take all responsibility for my decisions
I want the law the penalty and the fulfillment of my contract
Can’t he pay back the money
If that’s not enough I’ll sign a contract to pay ten times that much and I’ll give you my hands my head and my heart as security
There’s no power in Venice that can change an established decree
The change will be recorded as a precedent and many bad legal decisions will result
That can’t happen
Please let me review the contract
Shylock they’re offering you three times the money you lent
But I made an oath an oath an oath in heaven
Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it
No not for all of Venice
And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant’s heart to be cut off by him But please have mercy
Take three times your money
Tell me to tear up this contract
I’ll tear it up when it’s paid
You seem like a good judge
You know the law
I urge you to deliver your verdict
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind
I’m sticking to the contract
I beg the court to deliver the verdict
Well then here it is you must prepare yourself for his knife
Oh good judge
Oh you excellent young man
The law fully authorizes the penalty which you have to pay according to the contract
Very true
Oh wise judge
You’re so much older than you look
Yes his chest
Nearest his heart” Those are the very words
Yes
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh
I have it ready
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds Shylock so he doesn’t bleed to death
Is that called for in the contract
Not explicitly but so what
It wouldn’t hurt you to be charitable
I can’t find it
It’s not in the contract
Not much
I’m ready and waiting Give me your hand Bassanio
Goodbye
Don’t be sad that this happened because of you because Lady Luck’s been nicer to me than usual
Be sad only at the fact that you’ll lose your friend your friend doesn’t regret that he paid your debt
If the Jew cuts deep enough I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart
Antonio I married a woman as dear to me as life itself
But life itself my wife and the whole world aren’t more valuable to me than your life is
I’d give it all up yes I’d sacrifice them all to this devil here to save you
Your wife wouldn’t like it if she were here to hear you make that offer
I have a wife I love
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind
It’s nice you’re offering to sacrifice her behind her back
That’s what you get for marrying Christian husbands
I have a daughter
The court awards it and the law authorizes it
What a righteous judge
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest
The law allows it and the court awards it
What a wise judge
Come on get ready
But wait a moment
There’s something else
This contract doesn’t give you any blood at all
The words expressly specify “a pound of flesh” So take your penalty of a pound of flesh but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law
Is that the law
You can see for yourself
You asked for justice so rest assured you’ll get more justice than you bargained for
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go
Here is the money
Wait
The Jew will have justice
Wait don’t rush
He’s not getting anything except the penalty
So get ready to cut off the flesh
Don’t shed any blood or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh
If you take more or less than exactly a pound even if it’s just the tiniest fraction of an ounce if the scale changes by even so much as a hair you die and all your property will be confiscated
A second Daniel A Daniel Jew
I’ve got you now pagan
Why is the Jew waiting
Take your penalty
Give me my money and let me go
I have it ready for you
Here it is
Your father was an extremely moral man and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds
But tell me
Well first there was the prince from Naples
I’m afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith
Then there’s the Count Palatine
He does nothing but frown as if he wants to say “If you don’t want me I don’t care” He doesn’t even smile when he hears funny stories
If he’s so sad and solemn when he’s young I can only imagine how much he’ll cry as an old man
No I’d rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men
God protect me from these two
What did you think about that French lord Monsieur le Bon
No he refused it publicly in open court
He will have only justice and his penalty
You can’t have anything but the penalty to be taken at your peril Jew
Well then I hope he chokes on it
I’m not staying here to argue anymore
Wait a minute Jew
The law has another hold on you
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods
The other half goes to the state
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke
So you’ll be hanged at the state’s expense
I want you to see the difference between us so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon
Half of your wealth goes to Antonio
The other half goes to the state
Yes the state’s half can be reduced but not Antonio’s
No go ahead and take my life
Don’t pardon that
You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep
You take my life when you take away my means of making a living
What mercy can you show him Antonio
Nothing else for God’s sake
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property I’m happy as long as he lets me have the other half in trust to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter
Second he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his son in law Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies
He must do this or I’ll recant the pardon I just delivered
Are you satisfied Jew
What do you say
I’m satisfied
Please let me go
I’m not well
Send the deed after me and I’ll sign it
Go but sign the deed
I should really leave right away
I’m sorry you don’t have time Antonio give this gentleman a reward
We owe you love and service forever
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough
In saving you I consider myself well paid
My thoughts were never on money
I hope you’ll recognize me when we meet again
I wish you well
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude not as a fee
This ring sir oh no it’s nothing
I’d be ashamed to give you this
I don’t want anything but that
Now that I think about it I really want it
There’s more to this ring than its cash value
I’ll give you the most expensive ring in Venice and I’ll make a public announcement to help me find it
But as for this ring please excuse me
I see you like to make big offers sir
First you taught me how to beg and now I think you’re teaching me how a beggar should be answered
Good sir this ring was given to me by my wife
When she put it on my finger she made me swear never to sell it give it away or lose it
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts
If your wife’s not a madwoman and you tell her how much I deserve this ring she won’t stay angry at you forever if you give it to me
Well anyway goodbye
Bassanio let him have the ring
Come on you and I will go soon
Early in the morning we’ll both rush to Belmont
Come on Antonio
Find out where the Jew’s house is
Give him this deed and have him sign it
We’ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back
Lorenzo will be happy with what we’ve done
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock’s house
I’ll do that
Go hurry
You know where I’ll be waiting
The moon’s bright tonight
I think that on a night like this when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn’t make a sound  On a night like this  On a night like this  On a night like this
On a night like this young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much stealing her heart with vows of love but not one vow was true
On a night like this pretty Jessica in a bad mood said outrageously wrong things about her lover and he forgave her
I hear his footsteps
Who are you coming so fast in this quiet night
A friend
A friend
What friend
What’s your name please friend
My name’s Stephano and I’ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise
She’s still at the monastery kneeling and praying for a happy marriage
Who’s coming with her
No one except her maid and a holy hermit
Has my master returned yet
Hey hey
Hey
Yoo hoo
Who’s shouting
Hey
Have you seen Master Lorenzo
Stop hollering man
I’m here
Hey
Where where
Here
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news
My master will be here in the morning
My dear let’s go inside and wait for them to arrive
But I guess it doesn’t matter
We might as well call him a man since God created him
His horse is better than the Neapolitan’s and he frowns more than the Count Palatine
What about Falconbridge that young English baron
I have no opinion about him
He doesn’t speak Latin French or Italian and you know how little English I speak
He’s great looking but how can you talk to someone who doesn’t speak your language
He was dressed so oddly too
I think he got his jacket in Italy his tights in France his hat in Germany and his behavior everywhere
What do you think of his neighbor the Scottish lord
How beautiful the moonlight’s shining on this bank
Let’s sit here and let the music fill our ears
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music
Sit down Jessica
Look at the stars see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn
Get her attention and draw her home with music
I’m never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld
Nobody like that should be trusted
Pay attention to the music
That light we see is coming from my hall
Look how far that little candle sends its light
That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world
While the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle
Well brighter lights always dim the smaller ones
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody
Music listen
It’s your music madam from your house
Now I see that you can’t call anything good except in right context
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen
Quiet now
Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can’t be awoken
If I’m not mistaken that’s Portia’s voice
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo by its bad voice
Dear lady welcome home
We’ve been praying for our husbands' welfare
Have they come back
Go inside Nerissa
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone
I hear his trumpet
I think this night is just like sick daylight
It only looks a little paler
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden
I’ll give  Thank you darling
I’d like to introduce you to my friend
This is Antonio my dearest friend
Sir welcome to our house
But action speaks louder than words so I’ll cut short these polite words
What an argument already
What’s the matter
It said “Love me and don’t leave me” How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died and that it would be buried with you
And now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk
He will if he lives long enough to become a man
Yes if a woman grows up to be a man
I didn’t have the heart to say no to him
You were wrong to give away your wife’s first gift so thoughtlessly a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away
And here he is
I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind or even take it off his finger for all the money in the world
To tell the truth Gratiano you’re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset
If it were me I’d be very upset too
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it and deserved it too
And then his clerk who went to a lot of trouble with the writing begged for mine
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings
Which ring did you give away my lord
Not the one I gave you I hope
If I could make things better by lying I’d deny it
But you see my finger doesn’t have the ring on it
It’s gone
My dear Portia if you knew who I gave the ring to for whose sake I gave the ring to him why I gave it to him and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn’t accept anything but the ring you wouldn’t be so angry
If you’d known how much that ring meant how much the woman who gave it to you is worth or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring you wouldn’t have let it go
Nerissa’s got the right idea
I’ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring
What could I say my dear
I had to send it to him
Don’t let that lawyer ever come near my house
Since he has the jewel I loved which you swore you’d keep forever I’ll be as generous as you were to him
I won’t deny him anything of mine including my own body and my husband’s bed
I’ll recognize him all right I’m sure of it
So don’t spend one night away from this house
Watch me like a hawk
If you don’t if I’m left alone I swear I’ll have that legal expert as my bedfellow
All these quarrels are about me
Don’t be upset
All these friends are my witnesses so I swear to you I swear by your beautiful eyes in which I see myself reflected  Did you hear that
He sees himself in my two eyes so there’s two of him
He should swear by his two faced self and that’s an oath I’ll believe
No just listen to me
If you forgive my mistake I swear I’ll never break an oath with you again
I lent my body once to make him rich
My God it’s the same one I gave the judge
I got it from him
What did you cheat on us before we deserved it
Don’t be crass You all look confused
I’m speechless
Yes but the clerk will never do it unless he grows up to be a man
Madam you’ve given me life and given me a living too
How did you like the young German the duke of Saxony’s nephew
He’s pretty awful in the morning when he’s sobering up and even worse in the afternoon when he’s drunk
At his best he’s a little less than a man and at his worst he’s little more than an animal
I’ll do anything rather than marry a drunk Nerissa
You don’t have to worry about any of these lords my lady
I wish them all safe trips home
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive
How are you Lorenzo
My clerk has some comforting news for you too
Yes and I’ll give it to him for free
Ladies you’re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people
It’s almost morning but I’m sure you’re not fully satisfied about what happened
Let’s go inside and we’ll answer all your questions truthfully
All right then
My first question for Nerissa is whether she’d rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now since there are only two more hours till morning
When the day comes I’ll wish it were nighttime so I could sleep with the legal expert’s clerk
Yes madam that’s the one
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I’ve ever seen
I remember him well and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise
Hello do you have any news
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye madam
And there’s a messenger representing a fifth one the prince of Morocco who says the prince will be here tonight
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the first four I’d be very happy he’s coming
If he’s as good as a saint but is black like a devil I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me
Let’s go Nerissa 
Three thousand ducats hmmm
Yes for three months
For three months hmmm
As I said before Antonio will guarantee the loan
If I default he’ll pay you
Antonio will guarantee it hmmm
Can you help me
What’s your answer
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio will guarantee it
Your answer
Antonio’s a good man
Have you heard anything to the contrary
But his investments are uncertain right now
He has one ship bound for Tripoli another heading for the Indies
What’s more people at the
But ships are just fragile boards and sailors are just men
There are rats and thieves and pirates not to mention storms winds and rocks
But in spite of all this the man is still wealthy enough
I assure you he can
Oh yes to smell  This is Signor Antonio
To be honest I don’t know why I’m so sad
I’m tired of it and you say you’re tired of it too
I’d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports piers and waterways
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad
Shylock are you listening
If I remember correctly I can’t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately
But so what
Tubal a wealthy Jew I know will supply me with the cash
But wait a minute
How many months do you want
Shylock although I never lend or borrow with interest I’m willing to break that habit to help a friend in need
Oh yes three thousand ducats
For three months
Yes I forgot three months
That’s right
That’s not how I do business
When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban’s sheep Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham’s birthright because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir  What’s your point
Did he charge interest
Jacob didn’t have any control over what happened
That your interest payments are like Jacob’s sheep
But listen to me signor 
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you
Oh liars can look so honest
Three months from twelve months of the year
Let me see
The interest rate will be  Well Shylock
Signor Antonio you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto
And all because I use my own money to make a profit
And now it looks like you need my help
All right then
You come to me saying “Shylock we need money” You say that even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a stray mutt out your front door
And now you’re asking for money
What can I tell you
Shouldn’t I say “Does a dog have money
Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats” Or should I bend down low and in a humble and submissive voice say
If you’re going to lend us this money don’t lend it to us as if we were your friends
Instead lend it to me as your enemy
Look at you getting all riled up
I want to be friends with you and forget all the times you’ve embarrassed and humiliated me
I’m making a kind offer zero percent financing
That really would be kind
I’ll show you how kind I am
If you don’t repay me on the day we agree on in the place we name for the sum of money fixed in our contract your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like
It’s a deal
I’ll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice
No you can’t sign a contract like that for me
I’d rather go without the money
In two months a month before this loan is due I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments
A pound of human flesh taken isn’t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef
If he agrees great
If not goodbye
And I hope you won’t think badly of me
Yes Shylock I’ll sign the contract and agree to its terms
Then meet me right away at the notary’s
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract and I’ll go get the money for you right away
Hurry up my Jewish friend
My ships will come home a month before the money is due
I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me my darling queen
Thank you for saying that
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck
I swear by my sword which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times that I would face the meanest looking warriors on earth
But this is bad
Think about it carefully
Let me take my chances
Let’s go to the temple first
You can take your chances after dinner
I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew my master
Be tough” says the devil “and run” But then my conscience hanging around my heart says very wisely to me “My good friend Launcelot you’re a good boy the son of an honest man” really that should be the son of an honest woman since my father cheated on my mother
Anyway my conscience says “Stay put” “Go” the devil says
Don’t go” says my conscience
Conscience” I say “you give good advice” “Devil” I say “you give good advice” If I listened to my conscience I’d stay with the Jew my master who’s a devil
But if I ran away from the Jew I’d be following the advice of the devil who’s the very devil himself
The devil’s advice is nicer
I’ll run devil
Tell me to run and I’ll run
Excuse me young man how do I get to the Jew’s residence
Young man excuse me how do I get to the Jew’s
Turn right at the next turn but at the following turn turn left
Oh and then at the very next turn don’t turn left or right but turn down and around to the Jew’s house
Good heavens those are difficult directions
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot who lives with him is still there
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot
He’s not a “master” sir he’s just a poor man’s son
His father if I do say so myself is an honest but very poor man and thank God likely to live a long time
He’s just Launcelot
Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that
It’s obvious
No that’s not it trust me
So it’s not my business that’s making me sad
Well then you must be in love
You’re not in love either
But excuse me  Yes I’m talking about Launcelot sir
Oh no
God forbid
The boy was going to support me in my old age
What am I a cane
Don’t you recognize me father
Heaven help me I don’t know you sir
But please tell me is my boy God rest his soul alive or dead
You really don’t recognize me father
Sir I’m half blind
I don’t know you
Even if you had your eyes you still might not recognize me
It takes a wise father to know his own child
Well old man I’ll tell you news of your son
Give me your blessing
Please stand up
I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot my boy
Give me your blessing
I’m Launcelot who was your boy is your son and will be your child
I can’t believe you’re my son
Yes you’re right her name is Margery
If you’re Launcelot then you’re my own flesh and blood
Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward
I’m sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him
Lord how you’ve changed
How are you and your master getting along
I’ve brought him a present
How are you
My master’s a total Jew
You’re giving him a present
Give him a noose to hang himself
He’s starving me to death
You can see my ribs so well you can count them
I’m glad you’ve come father
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio
Thank you
What do you want with me
What do you want
To work for you sir
That’s what we’re trying to say sir
I know who you are
You can have what you want
Father go ahead
BASSANIO Please Leonardo think about this  I’ll do my best
He’s walking over there sir
Signor Bassanio
Gratiano
I have a favor to ask
Anything
Don’t say no
Let me go with you to Belmont
Well if you have to go you have to go
But listen to me Gratiano
Sometimes you get a bit too wild and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude
Please try to act a little more serious or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia
Listen Signor Bassanio there’s nothing to worry about
I’ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet even more
If I don’t do all this never trust me again
Well we’ll see how you act
Okay but tonight doesn’t count
You can’t judge me based on what I do tonight  
I’d rather see you having fun because we have friends coming who want to have fun
Anyway I have to say goodbye to you now
I’ve got some business to take care of
I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this
It’s hell in our house and you helped cheer it up like a funny devil
You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper he’ll be a guest of your new master
Give him this letter
Goodbye
I’m sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you
But goodbye
It’s not manly to cry
Goodbye
Goodbye Launcelot
Oh God what a heinous sinner I am being ashamed to be my father’s child
But I need to remember I’m related to him by blood not behavior
Oh Lorenzo if you keep your promise to me I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you
No we’ll sneak away at supper time disguise ourselves with masks at my house and come back in an hour
But we haven’t made any preparations
We haven’t even talked about who’ll be our torchbearers
I think it’s better to call it off
It’s only four o'clock now
We have two hours to get ready
Launcelot what’s going on
I recognize the handwriting
I bet it’s a love letter
Where are you going
To invite my former boss the Jew to dine tonight with my new master the Christian
Me too
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour
It’s good we’re doing this
Wasn’t that letter from Jessica
Some people will laugh at anything and others are so grouchy they won’t even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny
Goodbye then
You’re both very precious to me
You need to leave to take care of your own business
We’re available
Bassanio we’ll say goodbye for now since you’ve found Antonio
Don’t worry I’ll be there
I have to tell you everything
Who asked you to call her
I’m not asking you to call her
You always loved to tell me I couldn’t do anything without being told
Did you call me
Do you need something
I’ve been invited to supper Jessica
Here are my keys But why should I go
I wasn’t invited because they like me
They’re just flattering me
But I’ll go out of spite to feed off the wasteful Christian Jessica my girl watch the house
I don’t feel like going
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night
Please go sir
My new master is expecting your approach
And I’m expecting his reproach
And they’ve been plotting things together
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday at six in the morning four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday in the afternoon
What there’s going to be a masquerade
Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces
Block up my house’s ears I mean the windows
I’ll go ahead of you sir
What did that gentile fool say to you hmmm
He said “Goodbye madam” and nothing else
The fool’s nice enough but he’s such a huge eater and slow as a snail when he works
He sleeps all day like a cat
Anyway Jessica go inside
I might come back soon
Do as I told you
Shut the doors after you
Goodbye
If luck’s with me I’ll lose a father and you’ll lose a daughter
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him
He’s late
Yes and that’s surprising because lovers are usually early
Yes for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been married forever
That’s always true
Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down
Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time
We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it
Here comes Lorenzo
We’ll talk about this later
My dear friends thanks for your patience
I had business that made me late
When you have to steal your own wives some day I’ll wait for you just as long
Come over here
Who’s in there
Who are you
Tell me so I can be sure though I swear I recognize your voice
I’m Lorenzo your love
Lorenzo that’s for sure and I’m also sure you’re my love who else do I love so much
And now who but you knows whether I’m yours
As God is my witness you know you’re mine
Here catch this box
It’ll be worth your while
You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade
What I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I’m doing
I’ll lock up the doors grab some more ducats and be with you right away
My God she can’t be a Jew she’s too nice
God I’m crazy about her
She’s wise if I’m judging her right
She’s beautiful if my eyes can see
And she’s loyal as she has proven
And as long as she’s herself wise beautiful and faithful she’ll always have a place in my heart
Ah you’re here Come on gentlemen let’s go
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us
Who’s there
Signor Antonio
It’s nine o'clock
Our friends are all waiting for you
There’s no masquerade tonight
I’ve sent twenty people to look for you
I’m glad
I want to head out tonight
One of them contains my picture
If you choose that one I’m yours along with the picture
I wish some god could help me choose
Let me see
I’ll look over the inscriptions again
What does the lead box say
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has” Must give everything for what
For lead
Risk everything for lead
This box is too threatening
Men who risk everything hope to make profits
A golden mind doesn’t bend down to choose something worthless
So I won’t give or risk anything for lead
What does the silver one say
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves” As much as he deserves wait a minute there Morocco and consider your own value with a level head
What if I went no further and chose this one
But let’s see once more what the gold one says “He who chooses me will get what many men want” That’s Portia
The whole world wants her
They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living breathing saint
Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia
The wide ocean doesn’t prevent them from coming to see her they travel across it as if it were a little stream
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture
Could the lead one contain it
No it’d be a sin to think such a low thought
Lead’s too crass to hold her
Is she enclosed in silver which is ten times less valuable than gold
Oh what a sinful thought
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel but that’s just engraved on the surface
You don’t look well Antonio
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt
I’d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun
I’ll talk to you more about this some other time
I’m a fool Let’s go Lorenzo Goodbye for now
I’ll finish my lecture after dinner
Here an angel’s lying in a golden bed Give me the key
I will choose this one and try my chances
Damn it
What’s this
It’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket
I’ll read it aloud
All that glitters is not gold  You’ve often heard that said
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface
But gilded tombs contain worms
If you’d been as wise as you were bold With an old man’s mature judgment You wouldn’t have had to read this scroll
Portia goodbye to you
My heart’s too sad for long goodbyes
Losers always leave quickly
Good riddance Close the curtains and leave I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice
I saw Bassanio sail away and Gratiano went with him
I’m sure Lorenzo isn’t on their ship
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints
The duke went with him to search Bassanio’s ship
He got there too late
The ship was already sailing
But once he got there the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola
In any case Antonio assured the duke they weren’t with Bassanio on his ship
I’ve never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets
Ran off with a Christian
Oh my Christian ducats
Justice find the girl
She has the stones on her and the ducats” I know all the boys in Venice are following him yelling “His stones his daughter and his ducats”
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time or he’ll suffer for this
That’s a good point
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel
You should tell Antonio what you hear but don’t do it suddenly because it might upset him
I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye
Bassanio told him he’d try to hurry back
As for the Jew’s contract don’t let it be a factor in your plans
Then he shook Bassanio’s hand affectionately and they separated
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio
Let’s go find him and cheer him up
Yes let’s do that
Hurry hurry close the curtain quick
The prince of Arragon has taken his oath and he’s coming to make his choice now
Look here are the boxes prince
If you choose the one that contains my picture we’ll be married right away
But if you fail you have to leave immediately
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules
Okay I’m ready
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for
Gold silver and common lead
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you
What does the golden box say
Hmm let me see
We seemed to have two separate bodies but we had one heart
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend
It’s not friendly and it’s not ladylike
All women would be angry with you for doing it even though I’m the only one who’s hurt by it
I’m not insulting you
It sounds more like you’re insulting me
Didn’t you send Lysander as an insult to follow me around praising my eyes and my face
Haven’t you made your other love Demetrius who kicked me with his foot not long ago call me a goddess and a divine rare precious heavenly creature
Why does he talk like that to a girl he can’t stand
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you when he loves you so deeply
Why does it matter that I’m not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited
You should pity me for that reason not hate me
I don’t know what you’re talking about
Oh fine
All right go ahead keep up your little game pretend to be sympathetic but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back
If you had any sense of pity or manners you wouldn’t pretend to fight over me like this
But goodbye
It’s partly my own fault since I followed you here
Stay lovely Helena
Listen to my excuse
My love my life my soul beautiful Helena
That’s a good one
You can’t force me any more than Hermia can beg me
Your threats are no stronger than her whining Helena I love you
I swear I do
I’ll give my life for you just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don’t love you
I say that I love you more than he does
If that’s what you say go fight a duel with me and prove it
Lysander where are you going with all this
Why have you gotten so rude
Your darling
Get out you dark skinned gypsy
Get out you horrible poison
Get out
Are you joking
Of course he is and so are you
Demetrius I’m ready to fight you as promised
I wish we had a signed legal contract
I don’t trust you
Sure I hate her but I wouldn’t hurt her
I certainly did and I never wanted to see you again
So stop hoping and wondering what I mean
I’ve spelled it out for you clearly
Oh no
Oh that’s very nice
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
Puppet”
Why “puppet” Oh I see where this is going
So how short am I you painted barber pole
Tell me
How short am I
Good Hermia please don’t act so bitter toward me
He followed you
And I followed him because I loved him
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me kick me even kill me
Please let me go
You see how naïve and foolish I’ve been
Well get out of here then
What’s keeping you
My stupid heart which I’m leaving behind here
What you’re leaving it with Lysander
No with Demetrius
Don’t be afraid
She can’t hurt you Helena
She was a hellcat in school
And she’s fierce even though she’s little
Little” again
Nothing but “little” and “short”  Why are you letting her insult me like this
Let me at her
How are you my love Demetrius and Egeus come with us
I want you to do some things for our wedding and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both
We’re following you not only because it is our duty but also because we want to
What’s going on my love
Why are you so pale
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly
Probably because my cheeks' roses needed rain which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes
Oh honey
Listen in books they say that true love always faces obstacles
Either the lovers have different social standings 
Leave Hermia alone
Don’t talk about Helena
Don’t take Helena’s side
If you continue treating Hermia so badly you’ll pay for it
Hermia’s not holding onto me anymore
Follow me if you’re brave enough and we’ll fight over Helena
Follow”
No I’ll walk right next to you side by side
All this fighting is because of you
Stay where you are
I don’t know what to say
Believe me King of Illusions I made a mistake
Didn’t you tell me that I’d be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing
So far I’ve done exactly what I was supposed to do I put the love potion on an Athenian’s eyes
And so far I’m pleased with the way things have turned out since I find all of this commotion very entertaining
As you can see these lovers are looking for a place to fight
Hurry up Robin and make the night dark and cloudy
Cover the sky with a low hanging fog as dark as hell and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can’t run into each other
We’ve got to act fast my lord of the fairies
I like the morning
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean turning the salty green water to gold
But you should hurry anyway
Don’t delay
We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak
Up and down up and down I will lead them up and down
The people fear me in the country and the town
Goblin lead them up and down
Here comes one of them now
Where are you Demetrius you arrogant bastard
Say something
Lysander say something
You coward did you run away from me
Say something
Are you behind some bush
Where are you hiding
Are you there
He’s walking ahead of me and he keeps daring me to follow him
When I reach the place he’s calling from he disappears
This villain is much quicker than I am
I’ll rest here
Where are you now
No you’re just taunting me
You’ll pay for this if I ever see you face to face in the daylight
Go wherever you want
Oh what a long tedious exhausting night
Only three so far
We’re still waiting for one more
Two of both kinds makes four
Ah here she comes angry and sad
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this
I’ll sleep here until morning
If they do fight I hope Lysander is safe
Sleep well there on the ground
Where’s Peaseblossom
Here
Scratch my head Peaseblossom
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb
Here
Don’t tire yourself out monsieur
Oh and monsieur be careful not to break the honey sac
I’d hate to see you drowned in honey sir
Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed
Here
Give me your first Mr Mustardseed
Please stop bowing good sir
What would you like me to do
Nothing good sir except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head
I should go to the barber’s monsieur because I think I’m getting really hairy around the face
And I’m such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little I need to scratch
Would you like to hear some music my sweet love
I have a pretty good ear for music
Let’s hear someone play the triangle and the sticks
Or tell me my sweet love what you’d like to eat
Actually I’d like a few pounds of grass
I’d like to munch on some good dry oats
Or maybe I’ve got a hankering for a bundle of hay
There’s nothing like good hay really sweet hay
I have an adventurous fairy who’ll go seek out the squirrel’s secret stash and get you some fresh nuts
I’d rather have a handful or two of dried peas
But please don’t let any of your people wake me up
I really want to sleep now
Go to sleep and I will wrap my arms around you
Oh how I love you
I’m so crazy about you
Welcome good Robin
Do you see this sweet sight
Now I’m starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated
I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot and I scolded her and argued with her
She had put a wreath of fresh fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass
And now that I have the boy I’ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong
And gentle Puck take this transformed ass’s head off of the head of that Athenian man so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do they can all go back to Athens
But first I’ll release the fairy queen from the spell
Now Titania wake up my sweet queen
There’s your boyfriend sleeping right over there
How did this happen
Oh I hate looking at his face now
Be quiet for a while Robin take off his donkey head Titania get the fairies to play some music and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before
Music
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep
Play the music Take my hands my queen and we’ll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing
Being too old to marry someone young
Or else their guardians and advisors said no  What hell to have your love life determined by someone else
That’s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed
If true lovers are always thwarted then it must be a rule of fate
That’s the right attitude
So listen Hermia
I have an aunt who is a widow who’s very rich and doesn’t have any children
She lives about twenty miles from Athens and she thinks of me as a son
I could marry you there gentle Hermia where the strict laws of Athens can’t touch us
So here’s the plan
Listen Fairy King
I can hear the lark singing
Morning’s here
While we’re walking you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night
One of you go find the forest ranger
Unleash the dogs in the western valley
Let them go
Now go find the forest ranger
My beautiful queen we’ll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear
The forests the skies the mountains everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds
I’d never heard such raucous music such pleasant thunder
I don’t understand why they’re all here together
But tell me Egeus
Isn’t today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she’ll marry Demetrius
It is my lord
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up
Good morning my friends
Valentine’s Day is over
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now
Forgive us my lord
Please all of you stand up
My lord what I say may be a little confused since I’m half asleep and half awake
I swear at the moment I really couldn’t tell you how I ended up here
But I think I want to tell you the truth and now that I think about it I think this is true I came here with Hermia
Now the only person I love and believe in and want to look at is Helena
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here
We’ll talk more about this later Egeus I’m overriding your wishes
Come with us to Athens
We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast
Are you sure we’re awake
It seems to me like we’re still sleeping still dreaming
And he told us to follow him to the temple
Well then we’re awake
I’ll call it “Bottom’s Dream” because it’s so deep that it has no bottom
And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play
Or maybe to make it even more lovely I’ll sing it when the heroine dies
Have you sent anyone to Bottom’s house
Has he come home yet
No one’s heard from him
I’m sure he’s been kidnapped
If he doesn’t show up the play is ruined
It won’t go on
Will it
No it would be impossible
He’s quite simply the smartest working man in Athens
Yes and the best looking too
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness
You mean “paragon” A  The duke’s leaving the temple
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too
If we’d been able to put on our play we would have had it made
Oh that great funny guy Bottom
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life
Six pence a day would’ve been forced on him
I’ll be damned if the duke wouldn’t have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus
And he would have deserved it too
Where are my good fellows
Bottom
Oh how wonderful to see you
Oh what a relief
I’ll tell you everything exactly as it happened
Tell us Bottom
No you won’t get a word out of me
All I’ll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already
Now it’s time to get your costumes together
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible
Look over your lines again
And no one eat any onions or garlic
If we have sweet smelling breath I’m sure they’ll say “it’s a sweet play” Now no more talking
Get busy go
These lovers are saying some strange things Theseus
I’ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales
Lunatics lovers and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations
Their story is bizarre and astounding but it’s solid and consistent
Here come the lovers laughing happily I wish you joy my friends
Now what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime
Where is our entertainment director
What performances have been prepared
Let me see Philostrate
Here I am Theseus
Which plays what music
How will we pass the time without some entertainment
Keep your promise my love
Look here comes Helena
Hello beautiful Helena
Where are you going
Did you just call me “beautiful”
Take it back
You’re the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned
Oh you’re so lucky
Your eyes are like stars and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a shepherd in the springtime
If the world were mine I’d give it all up everything except Demetrius to be you
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship” That’s some sharp critical satire and it’s not appropriate for a wedding
Short but still tedious
That’s like hot ice and strange snow
How can this drama be so many contradictory things
It’s a play about ten words long which is the shortest play I’ve ever heard of
In the entire play not one word is well written and not one of the actors is right for his part
It’s tragic because Pyramus kills himself
I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal I had tears in my eyes but they were tears of laughter
Who are the actors
So let’s see it
No my noble lord
This play isn’t right for you
I’ve seen the whole thing and it’s completely worthless unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines which they memorized so painfully are funny
I’ll watch this play
Come on bring them in
You won’t see anything like that sweetheart
He just said that they’re no good at acting
In my travels great scholars have come up to me meaning to greet me with well rehearsed welcoming speeches and I have seen them tremble and turn pale and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences and botch their well rehearsed tones of voice because they’re so nervous and then break off abruptly at the end without actually welcoming me
Therefore love and tongue tied simplicity can say the most even when they’re saying the least in my opinion
Your grace the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready
Let him come forward
If we happen to offend you it’s because we want to
We don’t want you to think we came here to offend you except that we want to offend you with our good intentions
Please keep in mind we’re only here out of spite
We don’t come here with the intention of making you happy
We’re absolutely not here to delight you
By watching their show you’ll find out everything you’re likely to know
This guy doesn’t pay much attention to punctuation
He rode that prologue like a wild horse
He didn’t know how to stop it
The moral of this story is that it’s not enough to speak you have to speak grammatically
His speech was like a tangled chain
Who’s next
I wonder if the lion’s going to talk
It wouldn’t surprise me my lord
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better
It’s the smartest partition I’ve ever heard speak my lord
Pyramus is coming up to the wall
Be quiet
I’m afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise And you oh Wall oh sweet oh lovely Wall you stand between her father’s property and mine you Wall oh Wall oh sweet and lovely Wall
God bless you for doing this
But what’s this I see
I don’t see any Thisbe
Oh wicked wall through which I don’t see any happiness
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this
Since the wall is conscious it should curse back at him
I see a voice
I’ll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe’s face
Thisbe
You are my love my love I think
I’m your love no matter what you think
Will you meet me right away at Ninny’s grave
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming
I Wall have done my part
Now that I’m done Wall can go away
This is the silliest thing I’ve ever seen
The best plays are still only illusions and the worst are just as good if you just use your imagination to fill them in
In that case it’s your imagination that’s interesting not the play
Look here come two noble animals a man and a lion
Ah it’s a sensitive animal with a good conscience
He’s as brave as a fox
True
And as wise as a goose
Oh that’s not true my lord
He’s not brave enough to be wise
He’s not wise enough to be brave
Anyway he is what he is
Let’s listen to the moon
This lantern represents the moon
I myself am playing the man in the moon  Well then that’s the biggest mistake of all
The man should be inside the lantern
How else is he the “man in the moon”
He can’t go in there because of the candle
It’s too hot
I’m tired of this moon
Go ahead Moon
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon I’m the man in the moon this thornbush is my thornbush and this dog is my dog
Well all of these should be in the lantern because they’re all in the moon
But be quiet here comes Thisbe
This is old Ninny’s tomb
But where is my love
Good roaring Lion
Good running Thisbe
Good shining Moon Really the Moon shines very well
That’s good Lion
Oh teach me how you look the way you do and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you
I frown at him but he still loves me
Oh if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns
I curse him but he loves me
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection
The more I hate him the more he follows me around
The more I love him the more he hates me
It’s not my fault he acts like that Helena
That’s true it’s your beauty’s fault
I wish I had a fault like that
Don’t worry
He won’t see my face ever again
Lysander and I are running away from here
Before I saw Lysander Athens seemed like paradise to me
But Lysander’s so attractive that he’s turned heaven into hell
Helena we’ll tell you about our secret plan
Tomorrow night when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light (the time of night that always hides runaway lovers) we plan to sneak out of Athens
And then Pyramus showed up
So the lion disappeared
Sweet Moon I thank you for your sunny beams
But look poor me what a terrible tragedy is here
Eyes do you see
How can it be
Oh dainty duck
Oh dear
Oh Fate come and cut the thread of my life
Conquer crush conclude and kill
Oh Mother Nature why did you create lions
And so I’m dying
Okay now I’m dead
Now die die die die die
With a doctor’s help he might recover and become an ass again
I don’t think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning
I hope she keeps it short
Look she’s spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers
And now she’ll start moaning of course  Are you asleep my love
What are you dead my dove
Oh Pyramus get up
Speak speak
Can’t you talk
Dead dead
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes
Your lily white lips your cherry red nose and your buttercup yellow cheeks are gone gone forever
Lovers moan and weep
His eyes were as green as leeks
Oh Fate come come to me with hands as pale as milk
Soak your hands in blood and gore since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors
Tongue do not speak
Come trusty sword
Come blade drench my breast with blood
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead
Yes and Wall too
No epilogue please
Never apologize when the actors are all dead no one can be blamed
As a matter of fact if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe’s belt it would have been a very good tragedy
It’s a good tragedy very well done
But come on let’s see you do your dance
Forget your epilogue
The clock has chimed midnight
Lovers it’s time to go to bed
It’s almost fairy time
Dear friends let’s go to bed
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house
First rehearse your song from memory and make sure each note is pretty
We’ll all join hands and sing and bless this place with our fairy grace
If you forgive us we’ll make everything all right
I’m an honest Puck and I swear that if we’re lucky enough not to get hissed at we’ll make it up to you soon
If not then I’m a liar
So good night to everyone
Give me some applause if we’re friends and Robin will make everything up to you
From then on we’ll turn our backs on Athens
We’ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers
Goodbye old friend
We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow
I will my Hermia
Goodbye Helena
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him
But so what
Demetrius doesn’t think so and that’s all that matters
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows
Love can make worthless things beautiful
When we’re in love we don’t see with our eyes but with our minds
That’s why paintings of Cupid the god of love always show him as blind
And love doesn’t have good judgment either Cupid has wings and no eyes so he’s bound to be reckless and hasty
That’s why they say love is a child
He’ll run after her
Is everyone here
First Peter Quince tell us what the play is about then read the names of the actors and then shut up
Answer when I call your name Nick Bottom the weaver
Here
Tell me which part I’m going to play then go on
You Nick Bottom have been cast as Pyramus
What’s Pyramus
I’ll moan very believably Name the other actors But I’m really in the mood to play a tyrant
I could do a great job with Hercules or any other part that requires ranting and raving
A lover would have to be weepier of course
Francis Flute the bellows repairman
Here Peter Quince
Who’s Thisbe
A knight on a quest
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with
No come on don’t make me play a woman
I’m growing a beard
That doesn’t matter
You’ll wear a mask and you can make your voice as high as you want to
In that case if I can wear a mask let me play Thisbe too
Bottom you’re Pyramus And Flute you’re Thisbe
Robin Starveling the tailor
Here Peter Quince
Robin Starveling you’re going to play Thisbe’s mother Tom Snout the handyman
Here Peter Quince
I hope this play is well cast now
Do you have the lion’s part written down
If you do please give it to me because I need to start learning the lines
Let me play the lion too
And that would get us all executed
Yeah that would get every single one of us executed
Well my friends you’ve got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies they’d have no choice but to execute us
Because Pyramus is a good looking man the most handsome man that you could find on a summer’s day a lovely gentlemanly man
So you’re the only one who could play Pyramus
Well then I’ll do it
What kind of beard should I wear for the part
Whatever kind you want I guess
No you’ll see four days will quickly turn into four nights
And since we dream at night time passes quickly then
Finally the new moon curved like a silver bow in the sky will look down on our wedding celebration
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals
We don’t want it at our festivities
But I’ll marry you under different circumstances with extravagant festivals public festivities and celebration
Long live Theseus our famous and respected duke
I’ll play the part wearing either a straw colored beard or a sandy beard or a red beard or one of those bright yellow beards that’s the color of a French coin
It’s best to rehearse there because if we do it here in the city we’ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play
Meanwhile I’ll make a list of props that we’ll need for the play
Don’t leave me in the lurch
We’ll be there and there we’ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully truly obscenely
Goodbye
We’ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke’s forest
Got it
Be there or don’t show your face again
Hello spirit
Where are you going
I go over hills and valleys through bushes and thorns over parks and fenced in spaces through water and fire
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth
I work for Titania the Fairy Queen and organize fairy dances for her in the grass
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower
Goodbye you dumb old spirit
I’ve got to go
The queen and her elves will be here soon
He’s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king
He wants the child for himself to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests
Instead she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him
You do their work for them and give them good luck
That’s you right
What you say is true
That’s me you’re talking about the playful wanderer of the night
When she takes a sip I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck
But I slip from underneath her and she falls down crying “Ow my butt” and starts coughing and then everyone laughs and has fun
But step aside fairy
Here comes Oberon
And here’s my mistress Titania
I wish he’d go away
How  What are you jealous Oberon Fairies let’s get out of here
I’ve sworn I’ll never sleep with him or talk to him again
Wait just a minute you brazen hussy
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta
She was your boot wearing mistress and your warrior lover and now that she’s getting married to Theseus you’ve come to celebrate their marriage
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta when you know that I know about your love for Theseus
Weren’t you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night right after he’d raped her
And weren’t you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends like Aegles Ariadne and Antiopa
These are nothing but jealous lies
We haven’t been able to meet on a hill or in a valley in the forest or a meadow by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us
And because you interrupt us so that we can’t dance for them the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood just to get revenge on you
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe
Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep
So the pale angry moon who controls the tides fills the air with diseases
Spring summer fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places and now the confused world doesn’t know which is which
And this is all because of our argument
We are responsible for this
Do something about it then
You have the power to fix it
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon
All I’m asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew
Get over it
I won’t give up this child for all of Fairyland
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest
Maybe until after Theseus’s wedding day
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations then you can come with us
If not leave me alone and I’ll stay away from your turf
Give me that boy and I’ll come with you
Not for your entire fairy kingdom Come fairies let’s go
We’re going to have an out and out brawl if I stay any longer
Well go on your way then
You won’t leave this grove until I’ve paid you back for this insult
Yes I remember
You couldn’t see him but I could
He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts
But I could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery virginal moonbeams so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love
But I paid attention to where Cupid’s arrow fell
It fell on a little western flower which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love
Young girls call it “love in idleness” Bring me that flower
I showed it to you once
If its juice is put on someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees
Bring me this plant and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles
I could go around the world in forty minutes
When I have the juice of that flower I’ll trickle some drops of it on Titania’s eyes while she’s sleeping
She’ll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up even if it’s a lion a bear a wolf a bull a monkey or an ape
And before I make her normal again I can cure her by treating her with another plant I’ll make her give me that little boy as my page
But who’s that coming this way
Look I don’t love you so stop following me around
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia
Lysander I want to stop but Hermia stops my heart from beating
You told me they escaped into this forest
And here I am going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can’t find my Hermia
Go away get out of here and stop following me
You attract me to you you cruel magnet
But you must not attract iron because my heart is as true as steel
If you let go of your power to attract me I won’t have any power to follow you
Do I ask you to follow me
Do I speak to you kindly
Don’t I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and cannot love you
Yes but that makes me love you even more
I’m your little dog Demetrius
The more you beat me the more I’ll love you
Treat me like you would treat a dog kick me hit me neglect me try to lose me
Just let me follow behind you even though I’m not good enough for you
Just looking at you makes me sick
And I get sick when I can’t look at you
I rely on your virtue to protect me
This forest doesn’t seem deserted when you’re here because you are all the world to me
So how can anyone say I’m alone when the whole world is here to look at me
I’ll run away from you and hide in the bushes and leave you to the mercy of wild animals
The wildest animal isn’t as cruel as you are
Leave me alone
Or if you follow me you’d better understand that I’ll do something bad to you in the forest
Yes you already hurt me in the church in the town and in the fields
Shame on you Demetrius
Your behavior is an insult to all women
We cannot fight for love as men can
I’ll follow you and turn this hell I’m in into a kind of heaven
Goodbye nymph
Before he leaves this part of the forest you’ll change places you’ll be the one running away and he’ll be in love with you
Do you have the flower
Welcome traveler
Yes here it is
Please give it to me
Thanks good Egeus
What’s new with you
I’m here full of anger to complain about my daughter Hermia Step forward Demetrius My lord this man Demetrius has my permission to marry her Step forward Lysander But this other man Lysander has cast a magic spell over my child’s heart You you Lysander you’ve given her poems and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter
You’ve pretended to be in love with her singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair rings toys trinkets knickknacks little presents flowers and candies things that can really influence an impressionable young person
You’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be) And my gracious duke if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens
Since she belongs to me I can do what I want with her as the law says I can either make her marry Demetrius or have her killed
What do you have to say for yourself Hermia
Demetrius is an admirable man
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights
Snakes shed their skin there and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in
I’ll put the juice of this flower on Titania’s eyes and fill her with horrible delusions and desires
Don’t worry sir
I’m at your service
Okay let’s go
Everything’s fine now
One of us will stay and stand guard
Whatever you see first when you wake up think of it as your true love
Wake up when something nasty is nearby
Let’s do that Lysander
I’m going to rest my head on this little slope
We’ll have one heart one bed two bodies and one faithful vow
No Lysander
Don’t sleep so close to me
I just meant that our hearts are joined so we can almost think of them as one heart
So let me sleep next to you
Stay away for now and good night my sweet friend
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life
Amen to that
I’ll sleep over here
Stop Demetrius
Stop even if only to kill me
I’m telling you get out of here and don’t follow me around like this
Oh will you leave me alone in the dark
Don’t
Stay here at your own risk
I’m going on alone
Oh I’m out of breath from this foolish chase
The more I pray the less I get out of it
Hermia is lucky wherever she is because she has beautiful eyes
How did her eyes get so bright
Not from crying
If that’s the case tears wash my eyes more than hers
No no I’m as ugly as a bear since animals that see me run away in terror
So it’s no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia’s starry eyes
Don’t say that Lysander
Don’t say that
Why do you care that he loves Hermia
What does it matter
Happy with Hermia
No
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her
I don’t love Hermia I love Helena
Fruits and vegetables don’t ripen until the right season of the year
Likewise I’m young and my sense of reason has just ripened
Is it not enough is it not enough young man that I’ll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy
But goodbye
I have to tell you I thought you were a much kinder person than this
Oh how awful that a lady who’s been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one
Are we all here
Right on time
This is the perfect place to rehearse
This clearing will be the stage and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room
Peter Quince  What is it jolly Bottom
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work
First of all Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself which the ladies in the audience won’t be able to stand
What should we do about that
I think we’ll have to leave out all the killing come to think of it
Not at all
I’ve got a plan that will fix everything
I’ll tell them that we won’t hurt anyone with our swords and that Pyramus isn’t really dead
And to make it even clearer we can tell them that I’m playing Pyramus but I’m not really Pyramus really I’m Bottom the weaver
That’ll keep them from being afraid
All right we’ll have a prologue then
We’ll write it in alternating eight  and six syllable lines just like in a ballad
No add a couple more syllables
Make it eight and eight
Won’t the ladies be scared of the lion
I’m really worried about that
There’s no scarier wild bird than the living lion and we should remember that
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he’s not a real lion
No we can just announce the actor’s name and let his face show through the lion costume and have him say something himself
Because you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight
So is Lysander
You’re right Lysander’s admirable too
But since your father doesn’t want him to marry you you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man
I wish my father could see them with my eyes
No you must see them as your father sees them
Your grace please forgive me
But please tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius
So think carefully about what you want beautiful Hermia
Consider how young you are and question your feelings
Will the moon be shining on the night we’re performing our play
We need a calendar
Look in the almanac
Look up moonshine look up moonshine
What do you think Bottom
He can hold his fingers in a V shape like this and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack
If we can do that everything will be all right
Now sit down everybody and rehearse your parts Pyramus you start
When you have said your lines go hide in that bush Everyone else go there too when you’re not onstage
Speak Pyramus Thisbe come forward
Yes you are
You’re supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back
That’s “Ninus’s grave” man
And don’t say all of that yet
You just said all your lines at once cues and all Pyramus enter
It’s “never get tired” Oh
Help
It’s a monster
We’re being haunted
Run everyone run
I’ll follow you
Sometimes I’ll turn into fire
And I’ll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn
Why are they running away
Oh Bottom you’ve changed
What have you got on your head
What do you think I’ve got on my head
You’re acting like an ass don’t you think
God bless you Bottom God bless you
Reborn
But I won’t leave this spot no matter what they do
I’ll walk up and down and sing a song so they’ll know I’m not afraid
Who’d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird
I don’t think you’ve got much of a reason to love me
But to tell you the truth reason and love have very little to do with each other these days
It’s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn’t introduce them
You’re as wise as you are beautiful
No that’s not true
But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest I’d be wise enough to satisfy myself
I’m no ordinary fairy
So come with me
And I’ll turn you into a spirit like us so you won’t die as humans do Come here Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseed
Ready
Me too
Me too
And me too
Where should we go
Be kind and polite to this gentleman
Leap and dance for him
Feed him apricots and blackberries with purple grapes green figs and mulberries
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps
Bow to him fairies and curtsy to him
Hello mortal
Hello
Hello
Hello
I beg your pardon sirs Please tell me your name sir
Cobweb
I’d like to get to know you better Mr Cobweb
If I cut my finger I’ll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding And your name sir
Peaseblossom
Please give my regards to your mother Mrs Peapod and your father Mr Peapod
Good Mr Peaseblossom I’d like to get to know you better too And you may I ask what your name is sir
Mustardseed
Good Mr Mustardseed I know you very well
Those cowardly gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef
I swear to you many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before
I look forward to getting to know you better Mr Mustardseed
Take good care of him
Take him to my sleeping area
The moon looks sad to me
When she cries all the little flowers cry too
Keep my lover quiet
Bring him to me in silence
Ah here comes my messenger What’s going on you crazy spirit
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster
I led them on in this frightened distracted state and left sweet
At that exact moment Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him an ass
This is going even better than I planned
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian as I asked you to do
Yes I found him when he was asleep so that’s taken care of too and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping then you’re already up to your ankles in blood
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime
Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep
The only possibility is that you’ve murdered him
A murderer should look like you do so pale and grim
That’s how someone who’s been murdered should look and that’s how I look
You’ve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty and yet you the murderer look as bright and clear as a star in the sky
What does that have to do with my Lysander
Where is he
Oh good Demetrius will you find him for me
Did you kill him then
Oh how brave of you
A snake could do that as easily as you could
A snake did do it because no snake ever had a more forked lying tongue than you have
I didn’t kill Lysander
As far as I know he’s not even dead
Then please tell me he’s all right
If I told you that what would I get out of it
Please give in sweet Hermia And Lysander stop acting like she’s yours
Her father loves you Demetrius
She’s mine and I’m giving her to Demetrius
The privilege of never seeing me again
And now I’m going to leave your despised company
You’ll never see me again whether or not he’s dead
So I’ll stay here for a while
That’s the way of the world
Go around the forest moving faster than the wind and make sure you find Helena of Athens She’s lovesick and her face is pale from all the sighing she’s been doing because sighing is bad for the blood
You purple flower hit by Cupid’s arrow sink into the pupils of this man’s eyes
Young man when you wake up if she’s nearby beg her to cure your lovesickness
Should we watch this ridiculous scene
Lord what fools these mortals are
Step aside
The noise they’re making will wake up Demetrius
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl
Why do you think I’m making fun of you when I tell you I love you
People don’t cry when they’re mocking someone
How can it seem like I’m making fun of you when my tears prove that I’m sincere
You get trickier and trickier
Will you abandon her
Demetrius loves her and he doesn’t love you
Damn it
I see you’re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs
You’re competing for
Don’t be cruel Demetrius
In exchange give up your claim to love Helena since I love her and will love her until I die
Lysander keep your Hermia
I don’t want her
Helena it’s not true
Look here comes the woman you love
It’s hard to see clearly in the dark of night but it’s easier to hear well
I couldn’t see you Lysander but I heard your voice and that’s how I found you
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly
Why stay when love tells you to go
But what love could make my Lysander leave me
I had to hurry to my love beautiful Helena who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars
Why are you looking for me
Didn’t you figure out that I left you because I hate you
You can’t mean what you’re saying
It’s impossible
So she’s in on this too
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me
Have you forgotten all the talks we’ve had together the vows we made to be like sisters to one another all the hours we spent together wishing that we never had to say goodbye have you forgotten
Our friendship in our schooldays our childhood innocence
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles sewing it on one piece of cloth sitting on the same cushion singing one song in the same key as if our hands our sides our voices and our minds were stuck together
We grew together like twin cherries which seemed to be separate but were also together two lovely cherries on one stem
There is scorn and disdain in her eyes and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon
She can’t even imagine what “love” is
It would be bad if she knew about Benedick’s love and teased him about it
It’s true
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has
But who would dare tell her
If I said something she’d mock me so mercilessly that I’d probably disintegrate into air
She’d laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit
Like a fire that gets covered up Benedick should smother his love and waste away
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked which is as bad as being killed by tickling
No instead I’ll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions
You don’t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word
Oh don’t injure your cousin like that
With the quick intelligent wit she’s rumored to have she can’t really be such a bad judge of character that she’d refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick
He’s the only worthy man in Italy aside from my dear Claudio
True he has an excellent reputation
And he deserves it having been excellent before he had a reputation for it
When are you getting married madam
Tomorrow and then every day after that
Come on let’s go inside
I’ll stay in Messina until you’re married and then I’ll go to Aragon
I’ll go with you my lord if you’ll allow me
No taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it
I’ll ask only Benedick to come with me for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he’s a joker
He’s evaded love once or twice and since then Cupid doesn’t dare to shoot at him
Benedick’s heart is like a bell with his tongue as the clapper everything his heart thinks his tongue speaks
Gentleman I am not the same man I was before
I agree
I hope he’s in love
There isn’t a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love
If he looks serious he must need money
What are you moaning on about your toothache
I repeat he’s in love
Unless you’re talking about his love for this kind of foolishness which judging from his appearance he has he is no fool for love as you pretend
If he’s not in love with a woman then you can’t trust the usual symptoms
He brushes his hat in the mornings
What do you think that means
Has any man seen him at the barber’s
No but the barber’s assistant has been seen with him
And he’s rubbed himself with perfume
Can you smell out his secret now
But when  You take up your duties too cheerfully
That’s what her mother always tells me
Ah he got you back Benedick
Congratulations lady you resemble a most honorable man
Well even if he is her father I’m sure she wouldn’t want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders
I’m amazed you’re still talking Signior Benedick
No one’s listening to you
Look it’s my dear Lady Disdain
Aren’t you dead yet
That’s as good as proof that the sweet young man’s in love
The biggest clue is his seriousness
And when has he ever been known to wash his face
Yes or to wear cosmetics
I hear what they say about him for doing that
Indeed his mocking spirit has now crawled into a  Truly it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick
A conclusion a conclusion he is in love
Oh and I know who loves him
She’ll be buried with her face upwards then
This chatter is no cure for my toothache
It must be
My lord and brother God save you
Good evening brother
If you don’t mind I’d like to speak with you
In private
If you wish
But Count Claudio can stay for what I’m about to say concerns him
What’s the matter
You know that he does
I don’t know that once he knows what I know
If there’s any reason we shouldn’t get married I urge you to tell me
You may think that I don’t love you
I hope that after I tell you my news you will think better of me
My brother thinks highly of you and because of his affection has helped arrange your marriage but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy
Why what’s the matter
I came here to tell you I’ll make this short since she’s already been talked about for too long the lady is unfaithful
Who Hero
That’s the one Leonato’s Hero your Hero every man’s Hero
Unfaithful
The word is too good to represent her wickedness
She is worse than wicked
If you can think of a more awful title I’ll call her that
But don’t keep wondering without more proof
Come with me tonight and you’ll see a man enter her bedroom chamber even tonight the night before her wedding
If you still love her after that then marry her tomorrow
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind
I won’t consider it
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her I’ll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her
And since I wooed her in your name I’ll join you in disgracing her
Remain calm until midnight and then you’ll see what the trouble is
Oh this day has turned into a disaster
Oh mischief has ruined our plans
Oh a plague has been prevented thank God
That’s what you’ll say once you’ve seen part two
Are you all good and honest men
Come here Sir Seacole
God has blessed you with a good name
To be good looking is a matter of luck but to read and write is a natural gift
Both of which master constable  You have
I knew that would be your answer
Well for your good looks sir thank God and don’t boast about it
You’re thought to be the most
you will  And what if he won’t stop
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you’ve gotten rid of such a criminal
If he won’t stop when he’s told to then he isn’t one of the Prince’s subjects
We know what’s appropriate for a watch
Why you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman
Also you’re supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who’s drunk to go home and go to bed
And what if they won’t go
Well then leave them alone until they’re sober
If even then they don’t answer to your satisfaction you can say that they’re not the men you thought they were
Very good sir
So if we know that a man is a thief should we try to arrest him
You constable are representing the Prince himself
If you meet the Prince in the night you can order him to stop
No by our Lady I don’t think he can
I’ll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it
By our Lady I think that’s true
And if anything important happens find me and let me know
Well gentlemen we’ve heard our assignment
Let’s sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed
One more thing good gentlemen
Watch over Signior Leonato’s house with the wedding being held there tomorrow there’s a great to do there tonight
Adieu
Be  Conrade
Conrade I say
Come to think of it I thought I felt a scab there
I’ll get you for that
Now get on with your story
Since it’s drizzling stand under this overhang with me and like a true drunk I’ll tell you everything
You should know I’ve earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable
You should ask instead if it’s possible that any criminal could be so rich
Because when rich villains need poor villains' services those poor ones can name the price
I can’t believe it
That only proves how inexperienced you are
You know that the style of a man’s jacket or hat or coat means nothing
Yes it’s just clothing
Yes fashion is fashion
C’mon I might as well say the fool’s the fool
But don’t you see what a    Did you hear someone
Just the weathervane moving
But you’re all wound up about fashion too
No I’m not wound up
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret the Lady Hero’s waiting woman tonight
I should backtrack and begin with how my master Don John arranged for the Prince Claudio and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor
All ladies love me except you
It’s too bad I’m so hard hearted because I really don’t love anyone
Women are lucky then
You would make a nasty suitor
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me
Well I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up
If he has a face like yours a good scratching couldn’t make him look any worse
Listen to you instructing me like a parrot would
I’d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless
That’s it I’m done
You always slip out of the argument like this
I know you from before
And that’s everything Leonato Claudio Benedick my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina
I told him we’ll stay for at least a month and he says that he hopes we’ll stay longer
I think he’s actually serious and not just being polite
And they thought Margaret was Hero
We charge you in the Prince’s name to stop
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry
We have  And one of them is the criminal Deformed
I know him he wears a lock of hair
Gentlemen gentlemen    Gentlemen don’t speak
We
We’re probably a very valuable catch for these guys
Let’s go we’ll obey you
Good Ursula go wake my cousin and ask her to get up
I will lady
And request that she come here
Very well
Really I think your other ruff is better
No please good Meg I’ll wear this one
Honestly it’s not as good as the other one and I’m sure your cousin will agree with me
My cousin’s a fool and you are too
I’ll wear this one and none other
I like your new wig and headdress though I’d like it more if the hair were a shade browner
You know I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown the one that everyone praises so highly
Oh they say that dress surpasses all others
But for a fine elegant graceful and excellent dress yours is worth ten of those
I hope I enjoy wearing it for my heart is very heavy
It will be made even heavier soon by the weight of a man
Shame of what lady
Sex and marriage are honorable things even for a beggar right
And isn’t your husband an honorable man
Good morning sweet Hero
Why do you sound so odd
Are you ill
You sound out of tune
You sing and I’ll dance
Never
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves
Sorry I’m all stuffed
Ever since you lost yours
Doesn’t my wit suit me well
It doesn’t get seen enough you should wear it in your cap the way fools wear coxcombs
God I’m really sick
I just meant that you should use some holy thistle
Maybe you think that I think you’re in love
No by Our Lady I’m not such a fool to think what I please and I don’t please to think what I can and in fact I cannot think even if I could think my heart right past thinking that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well and now he’s become a real man
He swore that he’d never get married but now despite his earlier protestations he loves ungrudgingly
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does
It’s not a false gallop anyway
Madam we have to go the Prince the Count Signior Benedick Don John and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church
Good cousin good Meg good Ursula come help me get dressed
What do you want from me my good man
Indeed sir it is
Yes it truly is
What’s the news my good friends
Sorry sir Goodman Verges tends to ramble
Thank you for saying that your Worship but we’re just the poor duke’s officers
But truly if I were as
Oh so you’d give me all your tediousness
Yes even if I had a thousand more pounds than that for I hear that you are  Me too
God gives those gifts I had nothing to do with it
Now I must return to the wedding
One more thing sir
Examine them yourselves then bring me your findings
Now I’m in a great hurry as I’m sure you can see
Goodbye
My lord they’re waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio
I’m coming
Go to Francis Seacole the constable of the watch
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail
We won’t hold back any of our wisdom
We’ll drive them to a
I am being serious my lord
Thank you
I’m not a man who talks a lot but I thank you
If it pleases you your highness will you lead us all inside
Give me your hand Leonato
We will go in together
Benedick did you notice Signior Leonato’s daughter
I saw her but I didn’t notice her
Isn’t she a well mannered young lady
Do you want my true opinion
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women
No please speak seriously
Well it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly too dark to be praised fairly and too small to be praised greatly
I can only say this about her if she looked different than she does she would be ugly and since she can’t be anything but herself I don’t like her
You think I’m kidding
Please tell me seriously what you think of her
All right Friar Francis let’s keep this short
No
No he comes to be married  Lady do you come here to be married to this count
I do
If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage I order you on your souls to say so
Do you know any Hero
None my lord
Do you know any count
I’m sure I can answer for him he doesn’t know any either
Oh the things men dare to do
The things men are allowed to do
The things men do daily not knowing what they’re doing
What are we playing with interjections
Well then add some interjections that indicate laughter like  Hold on Friar
As freely son as God gave her to me
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift
Nothing sir except grandchildren
There Leonato take your daughter back
She only appears honorable from the outside
Look how she blushes like a virgin
Oh sin can disguise itself so artfully
Doesn’t that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent
All of you who are looking at her wouldn’t you swear that she’s a virgin judging by these outward shows
But she is no virgin
She has been in a man’s bed
She blushes from guilt not modesty
What do you mean my lord
My dear lord if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity  I know what you’re about to say
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you
Curse you for your false appearances
Is that why you’re talking so wildly
Good Prince say something
What should I say
I’ve been dishonored I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore
Are you really saying these things or am I dreaming
They’re really being spoken sir and they’re true
This doesn’t look like a wedding
It’s true
Oh God
Leonato am I standing here
Is this the Prince
Is this the Prince’s brother
Is this face Hero’s
Are these our eyes
Yes that’s all true but what do you mean by it my lord
Let me just ask her one question and by your authority as her father order her to answer truthfully
As my child I order you to do so
Oh God help me
What kind of game is this
We just want you to answer to your real name
Isn’t my name Hero
Who can stain that name with a just accusation
Indeed Hero herself can
You’ve stained your virtue with your own actions
What man were you talking to at your window last night between the hours of midnight and one
If you’re a virgin you’ll answer this question
I wasn’t talking to any man at that time my lord
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night
Pretty lady I’m much ashamed of your shocking behavior
What’s wrong cousin
Why have you collapsed
Come let’s go
These revelations have overwhelmed her
How is she
She’s dead I think Help uncle Hero why Hero
Uncle
Signior Benedick
Friar
Death is the best way to cover over her shame
How are you Hero
Yes why shouldn’t she
Why not
Isn’t every living thing condemning her
Am I sorry that I only had one child
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty
Oh one child is one too many
Why did I ever have one
Why did you once seem lovely to me
Why didn’t I just adopt a beggar’s child left at my doorstep whose shame and dishonor I could have denied not being its true father
Sir sir calm down
I’m so amazed by this I don’t know what to say
Oh on my soul my cousin has been slandered falsely
Lady did you sleep in her room last night
No I didn’t but I did every night for the past year
Then it’s confirmed
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity
But she must be Friar
You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges she doesn’t want to add perjury to her list of sins
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding
Two of them are completely honorable and if they have been tricked in this we must blame John the Bastard who lives to create conflict
I don’t know
If they have spoken the truth about Hero I will tear her apart with my bare hands
Age hasn’t dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much and luck hasn’t robbed me of so much of my fortune and my bad ways haven’t deprived me of so many friends that they won’t find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally with money and friends at my disposal
Hold on a moment and listen to my advice
The princes left your daughter here for dead
Hide her for a while in your house and tell everyone that she has in fact died
Make a bug show of mourning for her hang sad epitaphs up at your family’s tomb and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies
Why should we do this
What will this do
That will be a good thing
We’ll maintain that she died the instant she was accused and everyone who hears this will grieve for her pity her and excuse her actions
That’s how Claudio will respond
And even if they don’t at least Hero’s supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity
And if it doesn’t go well then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation away from the public’s eyes tongues mind and insults
Signior Leonato listen to the friar’s plan
And even though you know I’m very close to the Prince and Claudio I swear I’ll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly
Are you thinking of buying her
But tell me are you speaking seriously
Or are you just teasing
If I’m going to sing along with you I need to know what key you’re singing in
I think she’s the most wonderful woman I’ve ever laid eyes on
I’m still young enough to see without glasses and I don’t see what you’re talking about
But hey this doesn’t mean you’re looking to get married does it
Even if I had sworn never to marry I wouldn’t trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me
What’s going on these days
Isn’t there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife
Look Don Pedro has come back for you
This is a good agreement
Come lady you must die in order to live
Hopefully your wedding day is only postponed
Have patience and endure
Lady Beatrice have you been crying this entire time
Yes and I’ll keep crying a while longer
I don’t wish that on you
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused
Oh the man who avenged her could ask anything of me
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you
A very clear way but there is no friend who will undertake it
Can a man do it
It’s a job meant for a man but not you
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you
Isn’t that strange
It’s as strange as this other thing which I don’t understand
I feel awful for my cousin
By my sword Beatrice you love me
Not with any sauce they could provide for them
I swear I love you
Well then God forgive me
Why what have you done sweet Beatrice
You got to me first
I was about to swear that I loved you
Then do so with all your heart
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with
Come ask me to do anything for you
Kill Claudio
Ha
I wouldn’t do that for the whole wide world
Then rejecting my request you kill
Wait sweet Beatrice
My body waits here but the rest of me is gone
You don’t really love me
I beg you to let me go
Beatrice  I swear I’m going
Not until we part as friends
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy
Is Claudio your enemy
Hasn’t he proven himself to be a great villain slandering scorning and dishonoring my cousin
Oh I wish I were a man
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows and then with public accusation blatant slander pure hatred Oh God if only I were a man
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it
Listen to me Beatrice  Talking with a man outside her bedroom window
A likely story
No but Beatrice  Sweet Hero she’s been wronged she’s been slandered she’s been ruined
Beat 
Princes and counts
He’s a proper count that Count Sugarplum a sweet gentleman for sure
Oh if only I were a man
Or had a friend who would be a man for me
All this conversing has turned men into tongues and fancy ones at that
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules
I can’t make myself a man by wishing I were so as a woman I’ll die from grieving
Wait good Beatrice
I swear by this hand that I love you
Don’t just swear by it put your hand to some use that will prove you love me
That’s enough for me then
I’ll challenge him
I’ll kiss your hand and with that I leave you
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this
Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin
Which ones are the malefactors
Sir that would be me and my partner
Have them come in front of the master constable
Yes indeed bring them before me
What’s your name friend
Borachio
Please write down “Borachio” And yours
I’m a gentleman sir and my name is Conrade
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade” Gentlemen are you good Christians and do you serve God
Yes sir we hope so
How do you both plead
Honestly sir we say that we are not criminals
He’s a marvelously witty fellow no doubt but I’ll outmaneuver him Come over here I’ll whisper a word in your ear
Sir I tell you we believe you’re both lying criminals
Sir I tell you that we are not
Well okay I swear to God both their stories match
Have you written that down that they aren’t criminals
Master Constable you’re going about this all wrong
First you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them
Yes good idea that’s the
This man said sir that Don John the Prince’s brother was a villain
Write down that Prince John is a villain
I swear I don’t like the look of you
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero
That’s burglary that is
Yes by God that it is
What else did you hear
What else
That’s all
I’ll get there first and tell him what we found out
Honest to God where’s the sexton
Come on tie them up
Get away from me you ass
You ass
Don’t you suspect my office
Don’t you
If you keep on the way you’ve been going you’ll kill yourself
Stop advising me your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve
Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
So don’t advise me
Please leave me alone
I intend to be flesh and blood not airy philosophy for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune
But don’t take all that pain on yourself
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too
Now you’re talking
I definitely will
In my soul I believe Hero has been falsely accused
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way
Good evening good evening
Good day to both of you
Listen my lords  We’re in a bit of a hurry Leonato
Your highness will have to force me to tell
It’s good if you love Hero because she’s worthy of your love
You’re trying to trick me my lord
I swear I’m telling you what I honestly think
A bit of a hurry my lord
Well then good bye my lord
You’re in a hurry are you
Well then don’t bother
Come on don’t quarrel with us good old man
If it’s fighting he is after some of us here should run and hide
Who has wronged him
Indeed you have wronged me you liar
Don’t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword
I’m not scared of you
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you
Really I had no intention of going for my sword
Damn you don’t mock and sneer at me
I’m not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young and what he would do now if he weren’t so old
Claudio I’m telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child
You have ruined my innocent child
Your slander has broken her heart and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness
My wickedness
Yours Claudio yours I say
You’ve got it wrong old man
I’ll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does despite his youth and manliness
Not a chance
I’ll have nothing to do with you
You think you can get rid of me that easily
You killed my child
Take on someone your own size if you kill me boy you’ll have killed a man
He’ll have to kill both of us and indeed we’re both men
But let him start off easy by killing one of us
Come on kill me and brag about it
Let me at him
I will as surely as I am a gentleman
Brother  Quiet
God knows I loved my niece and now she’s dead slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue
Brother Anthony 
Hold your peace
But brother Anthony  Don’t it’s no big deal
Don’t bother with it
Let me deal with this
Gentlemen we won’t stay here and anger you further
I’m sorry about your daughter’s death but I swear our accusations were true and backed up with proof
My lord my lord  I don’t want to hear any more about it
No
Come on brother
I’m determined to be heard by someone
And you will be or some people here will suffer for it
Look here comes just the man we were looking for
What’s up mister
Welcome sir
You just missed a fight that was barely avoided
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth
Leonato and his brother
What do you think
I think if we had fought we would have proven too young and strong for them after all
There’s no bravery in an unfair fight
Look Benedick is so pale are you sick or angry
Lighten up
Sir don’t even try to beat me in a battle of wits
I’ll meet all your attacks even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop
Choose another tack
I think he really is angry
If he is that’s his problem
Can I have a word with you privately
God forbid he wants to challenge me
lain
You’ve killed an innocent woman and you’re going to pay dearly for her death
What do you say
What are we having a feast
Yes we are
Benedick Beatrice praised your wit the other day
I said you had a fine wit
True” she said “a fine little one” “No” I said “a huge wit” “Right” she said “a hugely awful one” “No” I said “he has a good wit” “Exactly” she said “it’s good and mild it doesn’t hurt anyone” “No” I said “Benedick is wise” “He is certainly” she said  She cried a lot at that and said she didn’t care
That she did
And yet for all that if she didn’t hate him to death she’d love him to death
Leonato’s daughter had told us everything
Absolutely everything
And moreover God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden
But when exactly will we see Benedick married
Yes with the sign underneath him that says “Here lives Benedick the married man”
Goodbye boy
You know what I intend
I’ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword it can’t hurt anyone thank God My lord I thank you for your many kindnesses
I’m leaving your court now
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina
The three of you have killed a sweet innocent woman
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel and good luck to him then
He’s serious
Very serious and I’m sure it’s because of Beatrice
And he challenged you to a duel
He did very sincerely
What a strange sight a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home
A guy like that is bigger than an ape but the ape could be his doctor it’s so much smarter
But wait a minute
Let me gather my wits and get serious here
Didn’t he say my brother has run away
Come on you
If they let you off then we’ll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power
Since you are a lying hypocrite we must look after you
What’s this
Two of my brother’s men all tied up
Officers what crime have these men committed
Well sir they’ve lied moreover they have said things that were not true secondarily they are slanderers sixth and lastly they have falsely accused a lady thirdly they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen and in conclusion they are lying scoundrels
First I ask you what they’ve done thirdly I ask you what offense they’re charged with sixth and lastly I ask you why they’ve been committed here and in conclusion I ask what they’re accused of
I tricked your own eyes
They’ve recorded my crimes and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master
His words are like poison to me
Yes and paid me well for doing it
He is made of treachery and has run away to avoid his crimes
Sweet Hero when I imagine you now you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you
Come take away the  Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton
Which one of them did it
Let me see what he looks like so when I see another man who resembles him I’ll know to avoid him
Which one is it
If you want to see your deceiver then look at me
Are you the slave who with your slanderous words killed my innocent child
Yes I am the one
No villain but you didn’t work alone
I don’t know how to ask you for forgiveness but I have to say something
Choose your revenge
I can’t ask you to make my daughter live that’s impossible but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died
And if your love can produce something from its sadness write a poem for her hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones
Sing it tonight
Then come to my house tomorrow morning and since you couldn’t be my son in law be my nephew instead
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero this girl is heir to both our estates
Marry her as you should have married her cousin and I will let my revenge die
And  I feel that I love her
I know that she is worthy of that love
Or in the power of reason
I was conceived by a woman and I thank her very much for all her effort
And then she brought me up and I thank her for that too
I swear before I die I’m going to see you sick with love
With anger with fever or with hunger sure my friend but never sick with love
If you can prove that I’ll ever be so in love that I can’t be brought to my senses with a good round of beers you can pluck out my eyes with a love poet’s pen and hang me on a brothel’s door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes
Oh noble sir
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands
I will see you tomorrow then
Now I have to leave
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot
Thank you for all your efforts
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy and may God bless you
God save the charitable organization
I leave a slimy bastard with you your Worship for you to punish and make an example of
God bless your Worship
I wish you well
I hope that God restores you to health
Goodbye gentlemen
We’ll see you tomorrow
We’ll be there
I will mourn Hero tonight
Please Margaret help me write this poem for Beatrice
You certainly deserve it
It’s just that my wit is very gentlemanly Margaret and refuses to hurt a woman
Now please tell Beatrice to come out
I’ll go get Beatrice for you who can walk here by herself she has legs
So that means she’ll come
I’m really a pitiful singer
Take  Beatrice have you come because I called for you
Yes sir and I’ll leave when you ask me to
Oh well stay till then
I spoke angry foul words to him and with that I will kiss you
If you had foul words in your mouth then your breath must be foul and foul breath is nauseating
Thus I’ll leave without being kissed
Your wit is so forceful it frightens the very meaning out of your words
But I will tell you this very plainly I have challenged Claudio and either he’ll accept the challenge or admit he’s a coward
Now tell me which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first
With all of them at once they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix
But tell me which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me
Suffer love
That’s a good way of putting it
I do suffer love because I love you against my will
You love me in spite of your heart I think
In this day and age if a man doesn’t erect his own monument before he dies he won’t be remembered past the funeral bell’s ringing and his widow’s crying
Exactly how long is that do you think
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying
That’s why it’s better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues like I do
That’s why I praise myself who if I do say so myself is quite praiseworthy
But tell me how is your cousin
I’m very sick too
Have faith love me and you will get better
Madam you have to go to your uncle’s
It’s been proven that Lady Hero is innocent that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived and that Don John who has run away is the source of all the trouble
Will you come immediately
Will you come with me to hear this news sir
I will live in your heart die in your lap and be buried in your eyes and what’s more I will go with you to your uncle’s
Is this the family tomb of Leonato
It is my lord
Here lies Hero The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words
To repay her for her troubles Death Gives her undying fame
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame
This epitaph will hang here forever Continuing to praise Hero after I die
Now start the music and sing the solemn hymn
Now I say good night to your bones Hero
I will perform this ceremony every year
Good morning gentlemen
Put out your torches
The wolves have finished preying for the night and look the gentle dawn is rising dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light
Good morning gentlemen
Didn’t I tell you she was innocent
And the Prince and Claudio who accused her are innocent as well because they were deceived by Don John
Well I’m glad that everything has been sorted out
Me too otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio
When I send for you come out wearing masks
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now You know your job brother
You have to pretend to be your niece’s father and give her away to Claudio
What do you need me to do
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her it’s true
And I see her also through the eyes of love
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio the Prince and me
But what did you want
Sir I’m puzzled by what you just said
And I’ll help you
Here comes the Prince and Claudio
Good morning to all these lovely people
Good morning Prince good morning Claudio
We’re waiting here for you
Are you still set on marrying my brother’s daughter
I wouldn’t change my mind even if she were
Well time will tell
Just you wait
Give him my respects and tell him I’ll definitely be there for dinner since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal
Bring her out brother
The friar’s ready
Good morning Benedick
I think he’s nervous he’s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated
Oh don’t worry about it we’ll dip your    I’ll get you for that one
But here are other matters to be dealt with
Which is the lady I’m supposed to marry
This one and I will give her to you
No you can’t do that until you take her hand and in front of this friar swear to marry her
It’s another Hero
Exactly right
And as surely as I am alive I am a virgin
It’s the former Hero
The Hero that died
She was only dead my lord as long as her slander lived
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true
Which one of you is Beatrice
Do you love me
No no more than is reasonable
Well then your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived
They swore you did
Do you love me
Truly no no more than is reasonable
Well then Margaret Ursula and my cousin have been very much deceived for they swore you did
They swore that you were sick with love for me
They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me
Oh well
So you don’t love me
No I don’t except as a friend
Come on niece I’m sure you love him
And here’s another poem which I stole from my cousin’s pocket in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick
What a miracle
Our handwriting gives away our hearts
Come on I’ll take you but honestly I’m only doing it out of pity
I won’t say no to you but let it be known that I’m only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life  I hear you were quickly wasting away without me
Oh shut up
I’ll stop your mouth with a kiss
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man
I’ll tell you what Prince a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn’t change my mood today
You think I care what I’m called
Well I don’t
No before
Musicians play us a song Prince you look sad
You should get a wife
Into God’s hands
From my house if I had a house ” “The sixth of July
Before you make  My lord you could really help me out now
I am at your service
Just tell me what you want me to do and however hard it is you’ll see that I’m eager to do it
Does Leonato have a son my lord
Hero is his only child and his only heir
Do you like her Claudio
Look if you really love the beautiful Hero enjoy it
Isn’t that the reason you told me all this
But I didn’t want you to think that I’m hasty in my emotions
That’s like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses
I’ll disguise myself as you and pour out “my” feelings to Hero taking her prisoner with the force of my love story
Let’s get started right away
Has he taken care of the music
He is taking care of it as we speak
But brother I have some strange news for you
Is it good news
Is this servant of yours a smart man
He’s very bright
I’ll get him to come here and you can ask him yourself
He must be very near by now
When I left him he was less than nine miles from here
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought
Not many and no one important
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely
Claudio deserves to be honored and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news
No no until it comes true we’ll pretend it was just a dream we had
But my daughter should know about this so she can be prepared with an answer just in case
Go to her and tell her for me
Cousins you all have work to do Oh I beg your pardon
Come with me now and help me out
Really my lord why are you so excessively sad
Therefore my sadness is without limit
You should listen to reason
I can’t hide what I am
Sure but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose
I’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother’s garden
Though I am not a flattering righteous man at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain
Until that happens let me be who I am and don’t try to change me
Can’t you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage
I use it all the time since it’s all that I have
Who’s that
What’s going on Borachio
Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage
Your brother’s right hand man
Who
That pretty boy Claudio
That’s the one
Hero the daughter and heir of Leonato
A lively young one
How did you learn about this
As I was working on one musty room the Prince and Claudio entered
Come let’s go to the dance
This just may cheer me up
If there’s any way I can spoil his life I’ll be overjoyed
You’ll both help me right
Until the day we die my lord
Let’s go to this great feast
Lead the way sir
Wasn’t Don John at dinner tonight
I didn’t see him
That man always looks so sour
Just looking at him gives me heartburn
He has a very gloomy attitude
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick
One of them is too much like a painting of a man he never speaks and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy always chattering
So the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John  And if he were handsome agile and rich too he could have any woman in the world all he’d need was her good will
Really niece you’ll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people
Honestly she is too ill tempered
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard
And then what would I do with him
So you’ll go to hell
No just to the gates of hell where the devil will meet me with the horns on his head like a cuckold and say “Go up to heaven Beatrice
He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit and I’ll have fun there forever
No I won’t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt
What woman wouldn’t be distressed being lorded over by a handful of dust
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay
No uncle I won’t be married
If he is too insistent tell him that romance is like a dance it has its own rhythm and timing
The wooing is like a Scottish jig hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion
Niece you are exceptionally perceptive
I have a good eye uncle
I can see what’s in broad daylight
The partygoers have arrived
Let’s give them room
My lady will you have a dance with me
As long as you move gracefully look handsome and say nothing I’m yours for the dance
And when will that be
When I like the way you look for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask
My mask is like the roof of the poor
If you wish to speak of love speak more softly
Well I wish you liked me
Tell me one
I say my prayers out loud
That makes me love you even more
Amen
Go ahead say “Amen” No more talking
I’ve got my answer
No really I’m not
I can tell by the way you waggle your head
Really I’m only pretending to be him
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself
Look you’ve got his wrinkled hands
You are Antonio you are he
In short I’m not
Come on do you think I can’t recognize you by your excellent wit
Can a good thing hide itself
Be quiet you are Antonio
A man’s virtues will always show themselves and that’s the end of that
Won’t you tell me who told you that
No you’ll have to excuse me
And you won’t tell me who you are
Not now
Who said that I was disdainful and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book
Well it must have been Signior Benedick
Who’s that
I’m sure you know him
No I don’t believe me
What he never made you laugh
Yes heavily
There’s no face more sincere than one washed in tears
And it’s definitely better to cry because you’re happy than laugh because you’re sad
There was no Signior Montanto in our army
Who are you talking about niece
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua
Oh yes Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever
Please tell me who is this man
Why he’s the Prince’s fool and a very dull fool at that
I’m sure he’s out there dancing
I could have sworn he trampled on me
When I meet this gentleman I’ll tell him what you’ve said
Oh please do
And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten because he’ll be too miserable for dinner
Come on we have to follow the leaders of the dance
In every good thing they do
No if they try to lead us to harm I will leave the dance floor at the next song
That’s Claudio
You know me too well
I am Benedick
Sir my brother is very fond of you
He is in love with Hero
Please make him change his mind
How do you know he loves her
I heard him swear he did
I did too and he also swore he would marry her tonight
Come on let’s get to the banquet
Though I said my name was Benedick I heard this news with Claudio’s ears
Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself
Friendship is enduring except when love is involved
Therefore all lovers should speak for themselves
Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion
Goodbye then Hero
Claudio
Yes that’s me
Will you come with me
Where
Right over to that  I hope he enjoys her
You sound like a cattle dealer that’s the way they sell bulls
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way
Please leave me alone
Look at you thrashing about like a blind man
A boy robbed you but you’ll beat up the post instead
If you won’t leave then
Oh the poor bird
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time
The Prince’s fool”
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful
Yes but I am insulting myself by thinking this way
I don’t have that kind of reputation
Well I’ll get my revenge
Now sir where is Claudio
Did you see him
Yes my lord I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news
I found him here  Beating
Why what did he do
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird’s nest and happily shows it to his friend who then steals it from him
What is trusting a friend such a crime
The criminal is the one who stole the nest
Lady Beatrice is angry with you
The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her
She speaks daggers and every word stabs
If her breath were as terrible as her words she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star
I wouldn’t marry her even if she were as blessed as paradise
Please don’t mention her
Look here she comes
Your highness could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth
I’ll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of
Really he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it
You’ve humiliated him lady you’ve put him down
Why are you so sad
I’m not sad my lord
What then sick
I’m neither my lord
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well he’s just civil as Seville as an orange with the same jealous yellow complexion
I’ve told her father and he’s given his permission
Tell us when you wish to get married and may God give you joy
Claudio take my daughter and with her take my fortunes
The Prince has made the match and may God bless it
Speak Claudio that’s your cue
For you I give myself away and I’m ecstatic about the exchange
Truly lady you have a merry heart
Yes my lord
I thank my heart the poor fool for it keeps away from seriousness
Look my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him
Why you’re absolutely right cousin
Thank the lord for alliances
So everyone goes off into the world except me who stays in because I’m sunburned
I should sit in the corner and sing that song “Heigh Ho for a Husband” Lady Beatrice I’ll get you a husband
I’d rather get a husband from your father
Don’t you have any brothers like you
Your father’s sons would make excellent husbands if only a girl could catch one for herself
Will you take me my lady
No my lord unless I could have another husband for the work week
You are too expensive to wear every day
But please forgive me your highness
I was born to speak cleverly not seriously
Niece will you take care of those things I mentioned
Oh yes I’m sorry uncle If you’ll excuse me your grace
I swear she’s a very good natured lady
There’s very little about her that’s gloomy my lord
She’s only sad when she sleeps and not even then
She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband
No not at all
She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit
She would make a good wife for Benedick
Oh Lord if they were married they’d drive themselves crazy within a week
Count Claudio when do you plan to go to church and be married
Tomorrow my lord
My lord I will help you even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight
Me too my lord
And you sweet Hero
I’ll do any decent thing my lord to help my cousin get a good husband
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of
This much I can say about him he is well born has proven his bravery in battle and has established his good character
Come inside with me and I will tell you my plan
But I’m sure he’ll get even with you
Signior Benedick served well in the war my lady
You had rotten food and he helped you eat it
He’s a good soldier too lady
He’s a lord to a lord and a man to a man
He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues
Absolutely he is stuffed like a dummy
Please don’t take my niece the wrong way sir
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves
Whenever they meet there’s a little battle
Every month he has a new best friend
Is that possible
It’s arranged
The Count Claudio will marry Leonato’s daughter
Yes my lord but I can spoil it
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio’s happiness will be like medicine to me
I hate him so much it makes me sick and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy
How will you wreck this marriage
I can only do it by lying my lord but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me
Quickly tell me how
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret Hero’s servant woman likes me
I remember
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night she looks out Hero’s bedroom window
How will that kill this marriage
That part is up to you
What will be my evidence
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince anger Claudio ruin Hero and kill Leonato
Is there anything else you wish
That’s all I want and I’ll do anything to accomplish it
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone
Tell them you know that Hero loves me
Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince who has compromised his honor by making the match and Claudio whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who’s pretending to be a virgin
Of course they won’t believe you without proof
If you make the accusation convincingly then my cunning won’t fail me
I’ll go now to find out the date of the wedding
Boy
Yes Signior
In my bedroom window there is a book
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard
I’m already here sir
I see that you are here but I’d like you to go there and then come back again
I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe
I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well crafted suit of armor now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket
I’m not sure but I don’t think so
I can’t promise that love won’t transform me but I can promise you this until I truly fall in love a woman will never make me act like such a fool
Ha
Look it’s the Prince and Mr Love
I’ll hide in the arbor
Well should we hear some music
Yes my lord
Come on Balthasar let’s hear that song again
Oh my good lord don’t make me insult music again with my awful singing
Come on please sing
Just know this before I begin I can’t play a single note that’s worthy of note
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes
That’s a good song
And a bad singer my lord
Yes do you hear me Balthasar
Please get some excellent music because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window
I’ll do the best I can my lord
Please do
Goodbye
Come here Leonato
What was it that you told me today that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick
Oh yes
I didn’t either
But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick whom she has always appeared to hate
Really my lord I don’t know what to make of it but she loves him with such a passion that it’s past all understanding
Maybe she’s just pretending
Yes that’s quite likely
Oh God
Pretending
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this then
Why what symptoms of love does she exhibit
What symptoms my lord
She will have a seat you heard my daughter tell you how
Yes she did tell us
Please please tell me
This is amazing
I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love
I would have sworn that too my lord especially against Benedick
Has she told Benedick how she feels
No and she swears she never will
That’s what’s driving her crazy
It’s true Hero says so
My daughter told me everything
Now that you speak of paper I remember a funny story of Hero’s
Oh you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has “Benedick” and “Beatrice” written all over it
Yes that’s the one
Oh she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her
It’s true
If she won’t tell Benedick someone else should
And what would that accomplish
He’ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more
If he did that it would be a charitable deed to hang him
She’s an excellent sweet woman and there’s no doubt that she is virtuous
And she is very smart
Oh my lord when wisdom and passion are in one body it’s ten to one that the passion will win
I am sorry for her as I should be since I am both her uncle and her guardian
I wish she were in love with me instead
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife
Please tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say
Is that a good idea do you think
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die for she says she’ll die if he doesn’t love her and that she’ll die before she tells him and she’ll die if he woos her and she’s made to hold back even one of her usual insults
She’s probably right
If she offers him her love it’s very possible that he’ll scorn it since as we all know he tends to be contemptuous
He’s a very proper man
And I swear to God he’s very smart
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit
It’s entirely possible
I can see you don’t like this gentleman
No absolutely not
But please tell me who’s his best friend
He spends most of his time with the good noble Claudio
Oh God Benedick will plague him like a disease
God help Claudio
If he’s caught the Benedick he’ll lose all his money before he’s cured
I’m going to make sure I stay on your good side lady
Do that my friend
You will never fall victim to Benedick’s charms my niece
No not until we see a hot January
Don Pedro is here
If he fears God he must necessarily keep the peace
If he breaks the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling
Well I’m sorry for your niece
Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice’s love
Against my will I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner
Lovely Beatrice I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me
If the job had been painful I would not have come
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message
Yes as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint
You don’t want to eat sir
Goodbye then
Ha
Against my will I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner” There’s a double meaning in that
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me” That’s like saying “Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying ‘thank you’” If this doesn’t move me to take pity on her I’m a horrible person
If I don’t love her I’m completely
Margaret run into the sitting room
You’ll find Beatrice there talking to Claudio and the Prince
Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we’re talking all about her
Tell her you heard us and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun
She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation
This is your job
Do it well and then leave us
I’ll make her come right away I promise you
All right Ursula as Beatrice arrives we’ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick
Whenever I mention him praise him more than any man deserves
It’ll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice
Let’s start
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much
That’s what the Prince and my fiancé say
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this madam
They did want me to tell her but I persuaded them that if they truly loved Benedick they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark
Why did you do that
Doesn’t Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice
What’s the matter lieutenant
I’ll beat him until the welts look like basket weave
You’ll beat me
Are you talking you villain
No don’t hit him lieutenant
Please sir restrain yourself
Let me go or I’ll knock you on the head
Come on you’re drunk
Drunk
No lieutenant God gentlemen Help Lieutenant sir Montano Help men The night guard is coming
Who’s sounding that alarm
The whole town will riot
You’ll be ashamed of this forever
What is the matter here
I’ll kill him
Stop right now
Stop
Stop
The general is talking to you
Stop for God’s sake
For heaven’s sake stop this savage brawl
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life because the instant he strikes he dies
Stop that alarm from ringing it’s scaring the islanders
What’s the matter here gentlemen Honest Iago you look upset
Answer me
I don’t know
I don’t
I’d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this
You’re famous for it
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler
Tell me
Othello I’ve been seriously hurt
I didn’t do anything wrong that I know of unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me
All right now I’m starting to lose my cool
That’s unbelievably bad
Iago who started it
You’re hitting close to home there
I’d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio
But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth
They were nearly killing each other as you saw when you pulled them apart
I can’t tell you anything else
Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano who was only trying to help him but I’m sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way and Cassio couldn’t let it pass
I’ll make you an example for the others to learn from
What’s the matter dear
Everything’s fine now sweetheart
Are you hurt lieutenant
Yes but no doctor can help me
Oh I hope that’s not true
You know I’m powerful enough to make you pay for this
Please wait sir
Why are you talking about robbery
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses
Your whole family will be ruined
What kind of crude jerk are you
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now
You’re a villain
You’re a senator
You’re going to pay for this Roderigo
I know who you are
I’ll answer for everything
My reputation my reputation
Oh my reputation Iago my reputation
I swear I thought you meant you’d been hurt physically
Your physical health matters more than your reputation
You haven’t lost it unless you think you have
There are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again
Go to him petition him
Drunk
Babbling senselessly
Squabbling
Swaggering
Ranting and raving to my own shadow
Oh wine is the devil
Who were you chasing with your sword
What did he do to you
I don’t know
Is that possible
I remember a jumble of impressions but nothing distinctly
I remember a fight but not why we were fighting
Why do we party until we’re like animals
You seem all right now
How did you get better
One weakness led to another to make me hate myself
Come on you’re being too hard on yourself
I wish none of this had happened given the situation here and your rank
But since this has happened you should fix it for your own good
I’ll ask him for my position back again and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths I wouldn’t be able to answer that
I was a reasonable man then I became a fool and finally a beast
Oh how strange
Every glass of liquor is damned and the devil’s the main ingredient
Come on now wine is good for you if you know how to use it
Don’t say anything bad about wine anymore
Lieutenant I think you know I’m your friend
I know that sir
Imagine me a drunk
Any man can get drunk sometime
I’ll tell you what to do
Othello’s wife has a lot of influence now
Ask her to help you get back your position
She is so generous kind and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to do everything she can even more than she is asked to do
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you
That’s good advice
I believe it completely
Early in the morning I’ll go visit Desdemona and plead my case
My situation is desperate
You’re doing the right thing
Good night lieutenant
Good night honest Iago
Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good
That’s really the best way to win the Moor back again
It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side
She’s full of good intentions
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces just like I’m doing now
The more she
And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all
Hello Roderigo
I’ve spent most of my money and tonight I got beaten up
So with no money but a little more wisdom I’m going back to Venice
You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient
No it heals gradually
We achieve things with our intelligence not by magic and intelligent planning takes time
Aren’t things going well
My God it’s morning
All this excitement has made the time fly by
Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep
Go
Now two things still need to be done
I’ll put her on that
Yes that’s the way I’ll do it
I’ll pay you for your trouble
Are these wind instruments
Yes they are
Oh there’s the problem
What’s the problem
Well we’ll stop then
If you’ve got any music that can’t be heard then play that
But as I said the general isn’t really in the mood to hear music now
We don’t have any music that can’t be heard
Then pack up your instruments and go away
Go
Do you hear my friend
Please don’t play games
CASSIO  She’s awake sir
If she feels like coming over here I’ll give her your message
Good to see you Iago
You didn’t go to sleep then
No
I’m going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona
I humbly thank you
Even for a  Good morning lieutenant
I’m sorry about what happened but I’m sure everything will turn out all right
The general and his wife are talking about it now and she’s defending you strongly
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you
But he says he still loves and respects you and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona if you think that’s all right
Please come in
I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely
Thank you very much
Iago give these letters to the ship’s captain who brought me here and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice
Now that’s done I’m going to walk on the fortification walls
I will my lord
Shall we go see this fortification men
We’re at your service my lord
I’ll do everything I can for you Cassio
Please do madam
I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before
Yes my lady
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service especially if I’m gone and someone else has my job
My husband will never get a moment’s rest I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
But if you didn’t know about it then you were wrong to get mad at us
I’d never play pranks on you
If she is you can sue me for lying to you
Light the candles
Wake up my whole household
I dreamt about this
Give me some light
It’s time for me to say goodbye to you
It would be inappropriate dangerous even for me to be seen working against the Moor as I would if I stayed
of patience
I’m your advocate and I’d rather die than give up on you
Madam here comes your husband
Madam I’d better leave now
Why not stay and hear me talk to him
No madam
I’m very uncomfortable and that won’t help my case
Well do whatever you think best
Hey
I don’t like that
What did you say
Nothing my lord or if I did I don’t know what
Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife
Cassio my lord
I really think it was him
What’s this my lord
I was talking to a petitioner here just now someone who’s suffering from your anger
Who do you mean
Your lieutenant Cassio
Oh if I’ve got any influence over you at all please patch things up with him
Please call him and tell him to come back here
Was that him just now
Yes
My love call him back in here
Not now my sweet Desdemona
Some other time
But will it be soon
Very soon because you want it
Will it be tonight at supper
No not tonight
Then tomorrow at dinner
Well then tomorrow night or Tuesday morning
Or Tuesday noon or at night or Wednesday morning
Please just name a time but don’t wait more than three days
His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers
So when should he come
Tell me Othello
I swear I could do so much  Please no more
I won’t refuse you anything
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold outside or eat nutritious food or do something that’s good for you
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test it’ll be something difficult and terrible
I won’t deny you anything
But in return please do one thing for me leave me alone for a little while
Would I ever deny you anything
No
Goodbye my husband
Goodbye my Desdemona
I’ll come see you right away
God help me I love you
My noble lord  What is it Iago
When you were wooing Desdemona did Michael Cassio know about it
Yes he knew about it the whole time
Why do you ask
Why are you curious Iago
I didn’t realize he knew her
Oh really
Oh really
Yes really
Do you see something wrong with that
Isn’t he an honest man
Honest my lord
Honest yes honest
As far as I know sir
What are you thinking
Thinking my lord
Thinking my lord” My God you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud
You’re thinking something
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife
What didn’t you like
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona you were like “Oh really” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible
If you’re my friend tell me what you’re thinking
My lord you know I’m your friend
I think you are
As for Michael Cassio I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest
I think so too
If they’re not honest they shouldn’t look like they are
Absolutely people should be what they appear to be
In that case I think Cassio’s an honest man
No I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on
Please tell me what you’re thinking even your worst suspicions
You want me to say what I’m thinking
You’re not being a good friend Iago if you even  Please don’t ask me to tell you
What are you talking about
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have men and women alike
If you steal my money you’re just stealing trash
It’s something it’s nothing it’s yours it’s mine and it’ll belong to thousands more
But if you steal my reputation you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer but makes me much poorer
I’m going to find out what you’re thinking
You can’t find that out even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn’t make me tell you
What
Beware of jealousy my lord
It’s a green eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours
Oh what misery
The person who’s poor and contented is rich enough
God help us not be jealous
Why are you telling me this
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy tormented by new suspicions every hour
No
If there’s any doubt there is no doubt
If you say my wife is beautiful eats well loves good company speaks freely sings plays music and dances well you’re not making me jealous
When a woman is virtuous talents like these just make her better
So please listen to me
I’m not talking about proof yet
Watch out
I know the people of Venice well
They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands
Do you really think so
That’s right she did
Well there you go
She was so young but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft
But I’m sorry I’ve blurted all this out
I beg your pardon for loving you too much
I’m indebted to you forever
You seem a little depressed about this
Not at all not at all
Really I’m afraid you are
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you
But I see you’re troubled
Please don’t take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken
I won’t
If you take it too seriously it’ll have bad effects that I didn’t want it to have
Cassio’s a good friend of mine My lord I can see you’re upset
No not too upset
Goodbye goodbye
If you see anything else let me know
Tell your wife to watch her
Leave me alone now Iago
My lord I’ll say goodbye now
and affection even if it’s just an act
He and I will be there
It’s true
She’s gone
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness
Now Roderigo where did you see her Oh that miserable wretch You say you saw her with the Moor Oh who would want to be a father How did you know it was her To think she tricked me so easily What did she say to you Get me more candles and wake up all my relatives
Do you think they’re married
Yes I really think so
Oh heaven how did she get out
My own flesh and blood rebels against me
Fathers never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray
Have you ever heard of anything like that Roderigo
Yes sir I have
I think I can find him
giving it back to him
That will tell you a lot
But in the meantime just assume that I’m paranoid as I’m pretty sure I am and keep thinking she’s innocent please
Don’t worry about how I handle it
I’ll say goodbye once more
This Iago is extremely honest and good and he knows a lot about human behavior
If it turns out that she really is running around on me I’ll send her away even though it’ll break my heart
Oh what a curse marriage is
I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love sharing the rest of her with others
This is the plague of important men our wives betray us more than those of poor men
It’s our destiny like death
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born
Oh here she comes
If she’s cheated on me then heaven itself is a fake
I don’t believe it
What’s going on Othello darling
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you
I’m sorry
Why are you whispering
Are you sick
I have a  That’s from lack of sleep
It’ll go away
Let me wrap up your head and it will feel okay in less than an hour
Come on I’ll escort you to dinner
I’m very sorry you’re not feeling well
hundred times
But she loves it so much (since Othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it
I’ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago
Heaven knows what he’s going to do with it
What’s going on
What are you doing here alone
Don’t snap at me
I’ve got something for you
You’ve got something for me
It’s a common  What
to have a stupid wife
Oh is that so
And what would you give me for the handkerchief
What handkerchief
What handkerchief
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona which you asked me to steal so many times
You stole it from her
She dropped it carelessly and seizing the opportunity since I was here I picked it up
Look here it is
Good girl give it to me
And what are you going to do with it
What’s it to you
If you don’t need it for some important reason then give it back to me
Poor lady she’ll go crazy when she sees it’s missing
Now go leave me
The Moor’s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions
Here he comes
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night
She’s cheating on me
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little
What’s with you my lord
I had no idea she was cheating on me
I never saw it or suspected it so it never hurt me
I slept well ate well and was happy
I never saw Cassio’s kisses on her lips
A man who’s robbed but doesn’t miss what’s stolen isn’t robbed at all
I’m sorry to hear this
I would’ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her the lowest ranking grunts and all as long as I didn’t know anything about it
Oh goodbye to my peace of mind
Goodbye to my happiness
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great
Goodbye
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums the flute and the splendid banners and all those proud displays and pageantry of war
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods goodbye
Othello’s career is over
Is this possible my lord
Has it come to this
Show me or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt
Oh heaven help me
Aren’t you a rational human being
Don’t you have any sense at all
Goodbye
What a horrible world we live in
It’s not safe to be straightforward and honest
No stop
You should always be honest
I should always be wise
I swear I think my wife’s faithful and I think she’s not
I think you’re trustworthy one minute and then not the next
I need proof
Her reputation was as pure as the snow but now it’s as dirty and black as my own face
As long as there are
I see you’re all eaten up with emotion
I’m sorry I said anything
You want proof
Want
Yes I want it and I’ll get it
But how
How will you get proof
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex
Death and damnation
Oh
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched
What can I say
What proof is there
It’d be impossible for you to watch them even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof we can get that
Give me one good reason to think she’s cheating on me
I don’t like what you’re asking me to do
But since I’ve gotten myself involved this far because I’m so stupidly honest and because I like you so much I’ll keep going
I recently shared a bed with Cassio and I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache
Monstrous
No it was just a dream
It’s a reason for suspicion even though it’s just a dream
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy
I’ll tear her to pieces
Just tell me this have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it
If it’s the same one  If it’s the same one or any one that belongs to her then together with the other evidence it’s pretty strong
Oh I’d kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could
Killing him once is not enough revenge
Now I see it’s true
My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous snakes
Be patient I’m telling you
You may change your mind later
Never Iago
I swear to God I’ll get revenge
Don’t get up yet
Let heaven be my witness I’m putting my mind my heart and my hands in Othello’s control
Let him command me and I’ll do whatever he asks no matter how violent
I accept your devotion with my deepest love
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio’s dead
But let her live
Oh damn her damn her
Come away with me
I’m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil
You’re my lieutenant now
I’m yours forever
Lead the way
I’ll stop at every house
I’ll reward you for your troubles
Why do you say that
Oh come on
Where does he sleep
Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you where I’m lying
What on earth does that mean
I don’t know where he’s staying so if I told you he’s sleeping here or there I’d be lying
Can you ask around and find out
Find him and tell him to come here
Tell him I’ve spoken to my husband on his behalf and I think everything will be all right
I think I can do that
Where could I have lost that handkerchief Emilia
I don’t know madam
Believe me I’d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me if he wasn’t so free of jealousy
He’s not jealous
Who him
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land
Look here he comes
I won’t leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back How are you my lord
Hot hot and moist
With a hand like this you need to
fast and pray to stave off temptations
It’s a nice hand an open one
But these days people give each other their hands without their hearts
I don’t know about that
Now don’t forget you promised me something
What did I promise my dear
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you
I have a bad cold that’s bothering me
Lend me your handkerchief
Here my lord
No the one I gave you
I don’t have it with me
You don’t
No my lord
That’s not good
almost read people’s thoughts
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her my father would love and desire her
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married
I did
Is that possible
Yes it’s true
There’s magic in its fabric
A two hundred year old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance
The silk came from sacred silkworms and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins' hearts
Really
Is that true
It’s absolutely true so take good care of it
I wish I had never seen it
Ha
Why
Why are you yelling at me so angrily
Is it lost
Is it gone
Tell me is it missing
God help me
What do you have to say for yourself
It’s not lost but what if it were
What do you mean
I’m telling you it’s not lost
Please hire Cassio again
Bring me the handkerchief My mind is full of doubt
Come on
The handkerchief
Damn it
And you say he’s not jealous
I never saw him like this before
They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food
They eat us up hungrily and when they’re full they vomit us up
Look here comes Cassio and my husband
There’s no other way
She’s the one who’s got to do it
Go ahead and ask her
Then I could stop wondering and find some other career
If his face changed as much as his personality has I wouldn’t recognize him
God knows I have done my best to argue for you and made him angry at me for being so aggressive
You’ll just have to be patient for a little while
I’ll do what I can more than I’d do for myself
Let that be enough for you
Is Othello angry
Can he even get angry
If he’s angry there must be something seriously wrong
Please do so
There must be some political news from Venice or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood
That’s the way it goes
We shouldn’t expect men to be perfect or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday
I hope to God it’s something political like you think and not jealousy involving you
Oh no
I never gave him reason to be jealous
But jealous people don’t think like that
They’re never jealous for a reason they’re just jealous
It’s like a monster that just grows and grows out of nothing
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s mind
Amen to that lady
I’ll go look for him Cassio stay around here
If he’s in a good mood I’ll mention you again and do everything I can
I thank you lady
Hello Cassio
Why are you so far from home
How are you my pretty Bianca
To tell you the truth I was just going to your house
And I was just going to yours
You’ve kept away from me for a week
Seven days and seven nights
A hundred and sixty eight hours
And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones
What a tedious wait
Oh Cassio where did you get this
Has it come to this
Well well
Oh come on woman
Well whose is it
It’s pretty
So I’d like it copied
Take it and do that for me and leave me alone for a while
Leave you alone
Why
I’m waiting here for the general and I don’t want him to see me with a woman
And why’s that
It’s not because I don’t love you
But you don’t love me
Please just walk with me a little ways and tell me if I’ll see you later tonight
I can only walk a little way with you since I’m waiting here
But I’ll see you soon
All right have it your way
I have to make do
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs
It’s better that you didn’t kill him
But he kept chattering so foolishly talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms that it was hard for me to restrain myself
But please tell me sir is your marriage  Let him do his worst
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will
Do you really think so
What do you mean do I think so
What just because they kissed in private
An illicit kiss
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so but they didn’t do anything
Naked in bed together but without doing anything
Come on Iago
As long as they didn’t do anything it would only be a minor sin
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief  Then what
Her reputation is also her own
Can she give that away too
But a handkerchief  God I wish I could forget about the handkerchief
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare he’s got my handkerchief
Yes what about it
That’s not good
What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you
Yes but he’d deny it all
What did he say
He said he did I don’t know
He was in bed with  With her
With her on top of her however you want to say it
In bed with her
On top of her
My God it’s nauseating
Handkerchief confessions handkerchief
Noses ears lips
Is it possible
This is the way to trick gullible fools
Hey Cassio
What’s the matter
This is his second fit like this
He had one yesterday
Rub his temples
No don’t
If you interrupt it he’ll foam at the mouth and go crazy
Look he’s moving
Why don’t you go away for a bit
When he leaves it’s very important that I talk to you
What happened general
Did you hit your head
Are you making fun of me
I wish you could face your bad news like a man
He’s subhuman like an animal
Did he confess
Sir be a man
Your case is better than that
Then I’ll know exactly what she is just as I know what I am
You’re wise
That’s for sure
While you were dazed by grief which isn’t appropriate for a man like you Cassio showed up here
I got him to leave and made up an excuse for your trance
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit and he promised he would
I’ll make him tell me the whole story again where how often how long ago and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future
I’m telling you just watch his face
But stay calm and don’t get carried away by rage or I’ll think you’re not a man
Do you hear what I’m saying Iago
Will you go hide
Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes
That’s the whore’s curse to seduce many men but to be seduced by one
Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing
And when he laughs Othello will go crazy
In his ignorant jealousy he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles gestures and jokes How are you lieutenant
The poor thing
He’s laughing already
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much
The poor thing I really think she loves me
Now he denies it a bit and tries to laugh it off
Have you heard this Cassio
He’s asking him to tell the story again
Go on tell it
She says you’re going to marry her
Are you
Ha ha ha
Do you think you’ve won
Me marry her
That whore
Please give me a little credit
I’m not that stupid
Ha ha ha
So so so so
You’re kidding
All right then
She thinks I’ll marry her because she loves me
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer
Now he’s telling the story
She was here just now
She hangs around me all the time
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore and the fool showed up
Ha ha ha
Now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom
Look out here she comes
Damn you
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief
I was an idiot to take it
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern
That was a likely story that you found it in your room and didn’t know who it belonged to
This is a love token from some other slut and you want me to copy its pattern for you
What is it my dear Bianca
What’s wrong
My God that’s my handkerchief
If you want to come have dinner with me you can
If you don’t want to then good riddance
Go after her go
Actually I should
Will you be having dinner with her tonight
Yes I will
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her
Oh Iago
And did you see the handkerchief
Was it mine
It was yours I swear
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him
She gave it to him and he gave it to his whore
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight
Oh she’s a fine woman
A fair woman
A sweet woman
No you have to forget all that now
Yes let her die and rot and go to hell tonight
Oh the world never saw a sweeter creature
But that’s not how you’re going to be
She’s so good at sewing and a wonderful musician
Oh she could sing a wild bear to sleep
Oh she’s so witty and creative
All the worse that she stooped this low then
Oh a thousand times worse a thousand times and what a sweet personality she has
Yes a little too sweet
Yes that’s for sure
Oh it’s dreadful dreadful Iago
If you still feel so affectionate toward her then why not give her permission to cheat on you
I’ll chop her into pieces
Oh it’s horrible of her
That’s worse
Get me some poison tonight Iago
I won’t argue with her so her beautiful body won’t disarm me Tonight Iago
Don’t do it with poison
Strangle her in her bed the same bed she’s contaminated
Good good I like that it’s only fair
Very good
And let me kill Cassio
You’ll hear more from me by midnight
Excellent good
That’s her father and his friends who’ve been roused out of bed
You’d better go inside
No I must let them find me
My good qualities my legal status as Desdemona’s husband and my innocence will protect me
Is it them
I don’t think so
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant
Hello everyone
What’s going on
He needs to see you right away
What do you think he wants
Something about Cyprus
I think it’s important
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight one after the other and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke’s already
They’re very anxious for you to get there
When you weren’t at home the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you
It’s good you found me
I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you
What’s that trumpet for
I think someone’s coming from Venice
Look your wife is with him
Greetings good general
The duke and senators of Venice greet you
What’s new cousin Lodovico
Very nice to see you sir
Welcome to Cyprus
Thank you
How is lieutenant Cassio
Well he’s alive
Are you sure of that
Excuse me
He didn’t say anything he’s reading
So there’s a rift between Othello and Cassio
Yes unfortunately
I’d do anything to bring them back together since I really care for Cassio
Damn it all
Excuse me my lord
Are you in your right mind
Is he angry
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place
I’m happy about that
Oh are you really
My lord
I’m glad you’re insane enough to admit it in front of me
Why sweet Othello    I haven’t done anything to deserve this
My lord no one will believe this in Venice even though I’d swear I saw it with my own eyes
That was too much
She’s crying
Oh you devil you devil
Get out of my sight
I wouldn’t want to stay here and make you angry
She’s obedient a fine lady
Please my lord call her back
Madam
My lord
What do you want with her sir
Who me
See how well she can turn
She can turn and turn and then turn on you again
And she can cry sir oh how she can cry
Very obedient keep crying Concerning this oh what fake emotion I am being ordered home Get away from me I’ll send for you later Sir I’ll obey the order and return to Venice
Cassio can have my job
And tonight sir I invite you have dinner with me
Welcome to Cyprus
Horny animals
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable
He’s changed a great deal
Is he sane
Is he losing his mind
He is what he is
I won’t say anything negative about what he might be
If he isn’t what he might be then I wish to God he were
Hitting his wife
It’s true that wasn’t such a nice thing to do
But I wish I could say that’s the last time he’ll do it
Is it a habit of his
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow and this is the first time he’s done it
Oh it’s too bad
It wouldn’t be right for me to tell you everything I’ve seen and heard
Just go after him and watch what he does next
I’m sorry I was so wrong about him
You haven’t seen anything then
No and I didn’t hear anything either or suspect anything at all
But you’ve seen her and Cassio together
Yes but I didn’t see anything wrong and I heard every syllable they said
Didn’t they ever whisper
Never my lord
Or ask you to leave the room
Never
Not even to get her fan or her gloves or her mask or anything
No my lord
That’s strange
I’d swear to you on my soul that she’s a good honest person sir
Tell her to come here
Go
She says all the right things but the dumbest brothel keeper would tell the same story
I’ve seen her do it
My lord what do you want
Please dear come here
What can I do for you
Let me see your eyes
Look at my face
What horrible thing are you imagining
I can tell you’re furious but I don’t understand what you’re saying
Go ahead swear to that so you’ll be damned to hell for lying
Heaven knows I am
Heaven knows you’re as unfaithful as hell
Unfaithful my lord
With whom
How am I unfaithful
Leave me alone Desdemona go away
Because of me
If you’ve been ordered back to Venice because of my father don’t blame me
You may have lost his respect but so have I
Even that I could put up with
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from has rejected me
Worse than that she’s polluted herself so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce
Even the goddess of patience couldn’t look at this and be patient it’s too horrifying
I hope you think I’m faithful to you
As faithful as flies in rotting meat which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows
Oh I wish you’d never been born
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore
What have you done
What have you done
Oh you streetwalker
What have you done
You brazen whore
I swear to God you’re accusing me wrongly
So you’re saying you’re not a whore
No I’m as honest as I am Christian
What you’re not a whore
No I swear it
Is that possible
Oh heaven help us
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello You whorehouse keeper
You
We’ve finished our business
Here’s some money for you
Please lock the door and keep quiet
What’s he talking about
How are you madam
Ensign what’s he doing in there
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship
If he can keep it he’ll be set forever
I don’t understand
He’s married
To whom
Here comes another group looking for you
It’s Brabantio
He intends to do something bad to you
Hey
Stop right there
Sir it’s the Moor
Get him he’s a thief
With who
I don’t have a lord
Don’t talk to me Emilia
Things have certainly changed
It’s fair for him to treat me like this very fair
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about
What can I do for you madam
How are you
I don’t know
When grown ups teach little children they do it gently and easily
He might have treated me like that because I’m as unused to abuse as a little child
What’s the matter lady
He called her a whore so many times and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can’t stand to hear it
Am I that name Iago
What name madam
What my lord said I was
Why did he do that
I don’t know
I just know I’m not one
Don’t cry don’t cry
What a day this is
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen give up her father and country and friends just to be called a whore
Doesn’t that make you want to cry
It’s just my bad luck
Damn him
How did he get such an idea
Heaven knows
I bet my life some evil busybody some meddling lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position
I bet my life on it
Nobody’s that bad
It’s impossible
If there is then heaven help him
Why should he call her a whore
Who’s been with her
The Moor is being tricked by some crook some terrible villain some rotten bastard
Oh I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with
Keep your voice down
Oh to hell with those people
It’s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I’d cheated on you with the Moor
You’re a fool
Shut up
Oh God Iago what can I do to win my husband back again
Please go to him my friend
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me
Here I’m kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me either by thoughts or actions or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else or if I never did love him or don’t love him now even though he tries to shake me off 
then I hope I have a life of misery
Unkindness is powerful and his unkindness may kill me but it’ll never destroy my love
I can’t say “whore” It makes me sick to say the word even now
Political business is bothering him and he’s just taking it out on you
If only that were all it is  It is I promise
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner
The Venetians are waiting for their food
Go in and don’t cry
Everything will be all right
How are you Roderigo
I don’t think you’re treating me fairly
What makes you say that
Well I won’t take it any longer
Will you listen to me Roderigo
Your words and actions don’t match up
That’s not fair
It’s the truth
The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would’ve made even a nun want to sleep with me
You told me she got them and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon but nothing like that ever happens
Well all right then
Fine
Fine” he says
All right” It’s not fine and I’m not all right
It’s wrong and I’m starting to realize I’m being cheated
Okay
It’s not okay
I’m going to tell Desdemona my feelings
If she returns my jewels I’ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her
If not I’ll challenge you to a duel
You’ve said what you have to say now
Yes and I’ll do everything I just said
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before
Give me your hand Roderigo
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable but I still insist I’ve done everything I could to help you
It doesn’t look that way to me
I admit it doesn’t look that way to me and the fact that you suspect me shows that you’re smart
But Roderigo if you’re as courageous and determined as I think you are then wait just a bit longer
If you’re not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me
Well what’s your plan
Is it feasible
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus
Is that true
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice
What do you mean get rid of him
I mean knock his brains out so he can’t take Othello’s place
And that’s what you want me to do
Yes if you want to help yourself
He’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute and I’ll go visit him
He doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet
When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him
I’ll be nearby to help you and between the two of us we can handle him
I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out
It’s nearly dinner time and the night’s going to be wasted
Let’s go
I want to hear more about this
You will
Please sir don’t trouble yourself
Good night madam
Thank you
You’re most welcome
Would you walk out with me sir Oh Desdemona  Yes my lord
Go to bed right this minute
I’ll be there shortly
I will my lord
How are things now
He looks calmer than he did before
Send me away
That’s what he said
So give me my nightgown Emilia and I’ll say goodnight
We shouldn’t displease him
Yes
I wish you’d never met him
That’s not what I wish
I love him even when he’s harsh and mean Help me unpin this would you I love even his stubbornness his frowns his bad moods
I put those wedding sheets on your bed as you asked
It doesn’t matter
Oh how silly we are
If I die before you do make sure I’m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin
Listen to you
Don’t be silly
She knew an old song called “Willow” that reminded her of her own story and she died singing it
I can’t get that song out of my head tonight
It’s all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary
Please hurry up
Should I get your nightgown
No just help me unpin this
That Lodovico is a good looking man
He’s very handsome
He speaks well
I know a lady in Venice who’d walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him
It’s the wind
My eyes itch is that an omen I’ll be crying soon
No it doesn’t mean anything
I heard someone say that’s what it means
Oh these men these men
Do you honestly think tell me Emilia there are women who’d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner
There are women like that out there no question
You Roderigo
Come on I’ll fight you
Sir your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do
You evil thief where have you hidden my daughter
You devil you’ve put a spell on her
It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her drugged her or kidnapped her
If he struggles use force
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world
Why wouldn’t you
By the light of heaven no I would not
I wouldn’t either by daylight
It would be easier to do it in the dark
Could you really do such a thing for all the world
The world’s huge
It’s a big prize for such a small sin
I don’t think you would
Actually I think I would and then I’d undo it after I did it
I wouldn’t do it for a nice ring or fine linen or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats
But for the whole world
Who wouldn’t cheat on her husband to make him king
I’d risk my soul for that
I’d never do such a bad thing not for the whole world
Why a bad action is just a wrong in this world but when you’ve won the whole world it’s a wrong in your own world so you can make it right then
I don’t think any woman like that exists
Yes a dozen of them as many as there are women in the world in fact
But I do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them
For instance our husbands
We have feelings
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too
They see smell and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands
I think they do
Is it out of lust
I think so
Is it a weakness
It is
And don’t we have passions and a taste for fun and weaknesses just like men
Then tell them to treat us well
Good night good night
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that not to follow their bad example but to avoid it
Here stand behind this wall he’ll come right away
Quick quick
Don’t be afraid
I’ll be right next to you
This will either make us or break us
I’m right behind you
Be bold and get ready
I don’t really want to do this but he’s given me good reasons
I guess it’s only one man no big deal
I know the sound of his walk Die villain
Oh I’m dead
I’ll be crippled forever
Help
Murder
murder
That’s Cassio’s voice
Iago has kept his word
Oh what a villain I am
That’s the truth
Help me
Get some light
Get me a surgeon
It’s him
Brave Iago how honest and trustworthy you are
You teach me how I should act
Whore your lover’s dead now and you’ll be going to hell soon
I’m coming slut
I’ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart
You’ve already stained our sheets with your lust now I’ll stain them with your whore’s blood
Help
Isn’t there a guard around
No one passing by
Murder
Murder
Something’s wrong the man sounds panicked
Oh help
Listen
I’ve acted like such a villain
Two or three men are groaning
But it’s dark out and it could be a trap
It’s not safe to go near them till we get more help
Nobody’s coming
I’ll bleed to death
Look
Here’s someone coming in his pajamas with a candle and weapons
Who’s there
Who’s shouting “murder”
We don’t know
Didn’t you hear someone shouting
I’m here here
For heaven’s sake help me
He’s a good man
Is that you Iago
I’m here I’ve been destroyed by villains
Help me
Oh lieutenant
What villains did this to you
I think one of them is nearby and can’t get away
That’s one of them
Damned Iago
You inhuman dog
Killing men in the dark
Where are these murderers
Are you good or evil
Judge for yourself
Signor Lodovico
That’s me
I beg your pardon
Cassio’s been wounded
Cassio
How are you doing brother
My leg’s been cut in two
God forbid
Bring me some light gentlemen I’ll bind the wound with my shirt
What’s the matter
Who’s shouting
Who’s shouting
Oh my dear Cassio
My sweet Cassio
Oh Cassio Cassio Cassio
You notorious whore
Cassio do you know who might have stabbed you like this
No
I’m sorry to find you like this
I’ve been looking all over for you
He’s fainted
Oh Cassio Cassio Cassio
Sir I believe this piece of trash Bianca has something to do with all this trouble Hang in there Cassio Come here bring the light
Do you recognize this face
That’s the one sir
Do you know him
Know him
Yes
I’m glad to see you
How are you doing Cassio Someone bring me a stretcher
Roderigo
It’s him it’s him
Good here’s the stretcher
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here
I’ll get the general’s surgeon
There wasn’t any problem
I don’t even know him
Keep an eye on her
Do you see
The guilty speak volumes even when they’re silent
What’s the matter
What’s the matter husband
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped
He’s near death and Roderigo’s dead already
Oh no good gentleman
Oh no good Cassio
This is what happens when you visit whores
Please Emilia ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight 
He ate at my house but that doesn’t make me nervous
Oh did he
I order you to come with me
Go to hell you whore
As moral as me
Damn you
Gentlemen let’s go make sure Cassio’s wounds are properly dressed Come on ma'am you can tell us another story
Emilia go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened Will you please go now
To prison until you’re called into court
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately on pressing state business
It’s true
The Duke’s in a meeting right now and he’s sent for you too
The Duke’s in a meeting
At this time of night
Bring him with us
The law’s on my side
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own
If we let crimes like this happen slaves and heathens will be our rulers
I have to do it I have to do it
But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble
But she’s got to die or she’ll cheat on other men
Put out the light of the candle and then put out the light of her heart
If I extinguish the candle I can light it again if I regret it
When I’ve plucked this rose I can’t make it grow again it will have no choice but to wither and die
Who’s there
Othello
Yes Desdemona
Will you come to bed my lord
Yes my lord
Oh my lord what do you mean by that
Be quick about it
I’ll wait over here
I don’t want to kill you before you’ve readied your soul
No I don’t want to send your soul to hell when I kill you
You’re talking about killing
Yes I am
Then heaven have mercy on me
Amen to that from the bottom of my heart
If you really feel that way then I hope you won’t kill me
Hmmph
I don’t know why I should be afraid since I haven’t done anything wrong
But I’m still afraid
Think of your sins
My only sin was loving you too much
Yes that’s why you have to die
You’re wrong to kill me for loving you
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that
You’re shaking with emotion
These are bad omens but I hope I hope they don’t predict my future
I will
What’s this all about
You gave that handkerchief the one I loved and gave to you to Cassio
No I swear by my life and soul
Bring him here and ask him
You’re on your deathbed
But I’m not dying yet
Yes right now
So confess your sin freely now
You’re going to die
Then heaven have mercy on me
Amen to that
And you have mercy on me too
I never gave him any token of romantic love
I saw him holding the handkerchief
You liar you’re turning my heart to stone and making me call what I’ll do murder when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice
I saw the handkerchief
He’s already done so
What my lord
That he had sex with you
What
Yes
He wouldn’t say that
No
Honest Iago’s arranged that
What is he dead
If he had as many lives as he’s got hairs on his head I would’ve killed them all in revenge
Oh he’s been betrayed and I’ve been ruined
Send me away my lord but don’t kill me
Kill me tomorrow but let me live tonight
No if you struggle with me  Just half an hour
Just let me say one prayer
It’s too late
What’s that noise
Aren’t you dead yet
Who’s there
Yes it’s Emilia
What’s the matter with you now
Yes just now my lord
Cassio’s killed a young Venetian named Roderigo
Roderigo’s been killed
And Cassio’s killed
No Cassio wasn’t killed
Cassio’s not dead
Then the wrong man is dead and sweet revenge has gone wrong
Oh I’ve been murdered unfairly
Oh Lord who’s that crying
That
What
Oh no that was my lady’s voice
Help
Help
Oh lady speak again
Sweet Desdemona
Oh sweet mistress speak
I’m dying an innocent woman
Oh who did this thing
No one
I did it myself
Give my love to my kind husband
Oh goodbye
Why how could she have been murdered
My God who knows
You heard her say it wasn’t me
Yes she said that
I must go report what happened
She was lying even as she was going down to hell
I did kill her
Then she was even more an angel and you’re an even blacker devil
She cheated on me and she was a whore
You slander her you devil
She was fickle and unfaithful like water
She was utterly true to you
Ask your husband if you doubt me
If I didn’t have a good reason to do this damn me to the very bottom of hell
Your husband knew about everything
My husband
Your husband
He said she was unfaithful
Yes with Cassio
If she’d been faithful to me I never would have given her up not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her
My husband
Yes he’s the one who first told me about her
He’s an honest man who detests evil actions
My husband
Why do you keep repeating that woman
I’m telling you your husband
Oh my mistress a villain has made a mockery of your love
My husband said she was unfaithful
Yes him woman
I said “your husband” Do you understand that word
My friend your husband the honest honest Iago
If he said that then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever
He’s lying through his teeth
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that
Ha
Go ahead do your worst
You weren’t good enough for her
You’d better shut up
Oh you idiot
You stupid fool
As dumb as dirt
I’ll tell everyone what you did even if it
The Moor’s killed my mistress
Murder murder
What’s the matter
What’s going on here general
Oh are you here Iago
You’ve done a good job that other men can attribute their murders to you
What’s the matter
I told him what I thought
But did you tell him she cheated on him
I did
Then you told a lie a sick wicked lie
I swear on my soul it was a lie
You said she slept with Cassio
Did you say Cassio
Yes with Cassio
Now be quiet
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed  No heaven forbid
You can’t trust them
It’s true they’re inconsistent
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships
And mine say a hundred and forty
And mine say two hundred
But often in these cases reports are just estimates
Yes we get the idea
It’s a messenger from the warships
And your lies caused this murder
I’ll kill myself out of grief
Oh evil evil
Are you crazy
I’m ordering you go home
Good gentlemen give me permission to speak
I know I ought to obey my husband but not now
Maybe I’ll never go home again Iago
Oh
Oh
Oh
Yes go ahead and moan because you killed the sweetest most innocent woman who ever lived
She was filthy
I’m glad your father isn’t alive to see this
him terribly
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell
It’s sad but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times
Damn it shut your mouth
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up
If you’re smart you’ll go home
I won’t
Shame on you
Drawing your sword on a woman
Oh you stupid Moor
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband
He’d begged me to steal it many times
You evil whore
You think she gave it to Cassio
No I found it and gave it to my husband
You piece of filth you’re lying
I swear I’m not lying
You absolute villain
He’s killed his wife
Yes yes
Lay me next to my mistress
He’s gone and his wife’s dead
Kill him rather than let him leave this room
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did
Let it all go
What did your song mean lady
Can you hear me
I’ll die like a swan
They sing when they die
Here it is
Uncle I’m coming out
Look in on me and talk with me or I’ll attack even without a weapon
What’s the matter
Look I have a weapon the best sword a soldier could have
I’ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon
But
who can control his fate
I’m not like that now
Don’t be afraid even though you see me with a weapon
This is the end of my journey the end of my life
Are you backing away in fear
There’s no reason to be afraid
Where would Othello go Oh look at you
You’re as pale as your nightgown
When we meet on Judgment Day that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell where devils will grab me
You’re cold cold and you were never hot with lust
Oh you damned villain
Whip me you devils so I don’t have to look at this heavenly sight
Where is that poor rash man
You mean the man who used to be Othello
Here I am
Where’s that snake
Bring the villain forward
I don’t like it that you knew about this Iago
Damn it you’re not listening to me
You told me you hated him
I do hate
But that’s just a fairy tale
If you are a devil I won’t be able to kill you
Take his sword away from him
I’m bleeding but you didn’t kill me
I’m not sorry either
I want you to live since to me death is happiness
Say anything
This poor guy’s partly confessed his plan
Did you plan Cassio’s death with him
Yes
Dear general I never gave you any reason to hate me
I believe you and I ask you to forgive me
Will you please make this half devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul
Don’t ask me anything
You know what you know
From this moment on I’ll never say another word
What not even to pray
Well do your best
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio
Oh you villain
Ungodly and monstrous
Oh you wicked scoundrel
Cassio how did you get my wife’s handkerchief
I found it in my room and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes
You’re stripped of your power and your command and Cassio will govern Cyprus
As for this slave Iago if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time he’ll have it
You’ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government Okay take him away
But enough about that
When you record these sad events in your letters please describe me exactly as I am
Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility
If you’re being fair you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much but who wasn’t wise about it
Write all this
down and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this
Oh what a bloody end to all this
Everything we’ve heard is bad
I was afraid this would happen because he was a noble brave man but I didn’t think he had a weapon
What do you think about this change
They can’t have changed there’s no way this could be true
It’s a trick to confuse us
Here’s some more news coming in
That’s just what I thought
How many can you guess
Thirty ships
Now they’ve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus
Signor Montano your brave and loyal servant gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him
Then it’s certain they’re heading for Cyprus
Is Marcus Luccicos in town
No he’s in Florence
Write to him immediately
Hurry
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor
Forgive me your grace
Why what’s the matter
It’s my daughter
Oh my daughter
Is she dead
She’s dead to me
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit and impose the death penalty if you choose to even if the criminal were my own son
I humbly thank you sir
We’re sorry to hear this
Nothing but this is true
There’s nothing more
I’m awkward in my speech and I’m not a smooth talker
She blushes at the slightest thing
The devil must be behind this
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her
Tell us Othello
Or did you agree to this as equals
of her father
Bring Desdemona here
You know where she is
In the meantime I’ll tell you all as honestly as I confess my sins to God how I wooed this beautiful lady and how she came to love me
Tell us Othello
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often continually asking me about my life and all the battles I’ve fought
When I talked about all these things Desdemona used to listen attentively
She said she wished she hadn’t heard it but she also wished there was a man like me for her
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell she’d fall in love with him
I took the hint and spoke to her
She said she loved me for the dangers I’d survived and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me
That’s the only witchcraft I ever used
Here comes my wife now
She’ll confirm everything
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over
Please let her speak
If she admits she wanted this then I won’t blame Othello Come here my child
Who do you obey here
Father this isn’t easy for me
I’m torn
You’re the one I have to obey
I’m your daughter
I’m finished then
Duke please go ahead with your state business
I’d rather adopt a child than have one of my own Come here Moor
With all my heart I give you that thing which if you didn’t already have it I’d try with all my heart to keep from you
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant I’m done my lord
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers if you can’t change something don’t cry about it
Please I’m asking you go ahead and get back to your state affairs
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet
She can stay at her father’s house
I won’t allow it
Neither will I
Dear Duke please listen to what I have to say
What do you want to do Desdemona
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him
I saw Othello’s true face when I saw his mind
Let me go with him
Please allow her to do this
You can decide that privately
What’s important is the urgency of this mission
You’ll have to leave tonight
With all my heart I’ll go right away
We’ll meet again at nine in the morning
Othello have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you
He’ll accompany my wife and bring whatever else you think I might need
which any peace lover can do
His military understanding is all theory no practice
And there’s nothing I can do about it
That’s the curse of military service
Now you tell me should I feel loyal to the Moor
If you don’t like him you should quit
No calm down
I’m serving under him to take advantage of him
We can’t all be masters and not all masters should be followed
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food and then when they get old they’re terminated
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid
Let me tell
All right then
Treat Desdemona well
Keep an eye on her Moor
She lied to me and she may lie to you
Iago I’m leaving my dear Desdemona with you
Have your wife attend to her and bring them along as soon as you can
Come on Desdemona I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with you to tell you what you need to do
We’re on a tight schedule
Iago
What do you have to say noble friend
What do you think I should do
Go to bed and sleep
I’m going to go drown myself
If you do that I’ll never respect you again
Why you silly man
Oh how stupid
I’ve been alive for twenty eight years and I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him
I’d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can’t have
What should I do
I know it’s foolish to be so much in love but I can’t help it
Can’t help it
Nonsense
What we are is up to us
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener
Depending on what we plant weeds or lettuce or one kind of herb rather than a variety the garden will either be barren and useless or rich and productive
If we didn’t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires our bodily urges would take over
Thankfully we have reason to cool our raging lusts
I don’t believe it
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower
Come on be a man
Drown yourself
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies don’t drown yourself
I’ve told you I’m your friend and I’ll stick by you
I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now
Here’s what you’ll do
Moors are moody people So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter
She’ll have to have it
So have your money ready
If you want to go to hell there are better ways to do it than killing yourself
Raise all the money you can
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl
And to hell with drowning yourself
That’s completely beside the point
You can trust me
Go now and get cash
I told you before and I’ll tell you again and again I hate the Moor
So let’s join forces and get revenge
Go get money
We’ll speak again tomorrow
Goodbye
Where will we meet in the morning
At my house
I’ll be there early
No more talk about killing yourself okay
I’ve changed my mind about that
Go then goodbye
Put a lot of cash together
I’m going to sell all my land
That’s how I always do it getting money from fools
I’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn’t get something useful out of him
I hate the Moor and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife
I’m not sure it’s true but just the suspicion is enough for me
He thinks highly of me
Cassio’s a handsome man
Let’s see how can I
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time
How
How
Let’s see
I’ve worked it out
What can you see out on the ocean
Nothing
It was windy on shore too
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications
What do you think will be the result of this storm
The Turkish navy will be broken up
The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky
I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed
If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor their men must all be drowned
No ship could survive this storm
I’ve got news boys the war’s over
This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked
What
Is this true
Michael Cassio lieutenant of the Moor Othello has arrived on shore
The Moor himself is still at sea
I’m happy about that
He’ll be a good governor
The two of them were separated during the storm
I hope to God Othello’s all right
Let’s do that
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive
Thanks you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello
I hope heaven protects him from the weather because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea
Is his ship sturdy
Yes it’s well built and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced
What’s all that shouting about
Please go find out for certain who has arrived
I’ll do that
Good lieutenant is your general married
A man named Iago the general’s ensign
Who’s that
Look the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore
We should all kneel before her men of Cyprus
Greetings my lady and may God always be with you
Thank you brave Cassio
Is there any news about my husband
He hasn’t arrived yet
As far as I know he’s okay and will arrive here soon
Oh but I’m worried
How did you two get separated
The storm separated us
Go find out the news
you as sure as your name’s Roderigo if I were the Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago
I’m not who I appear to be
Do it and shout like the city’s on fire
Hey Brabantio
Signor Brabantio hey
Thieves
Thieves
Check on your daughter your house your money
Thieves
Thieves
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me you’d be sick of her by now
She’s always talking when I want to sleep
I admit that in front of you my lady she keeps a bit quiet
You have no reason to say that
Come on come on
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats
Shame on you you slanderer
No it’s true or if it’s not I’m a villain
You wake up to have fun and you start work when you go to bed
No I don’t
But if you had to say something nice about me what would you say
Don’t make me do it my lady
I’m critical by nature
Yes madam
I’m not as happy as I seem
Come on what would you say about me
Very clever
Even if she’s ugly she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her
This is getting worse and worse
What if she’s pretty but stupid
You don’t know a thing
You give your best praise to the worst women
But how would you praise a truly good woman someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her
A woman who was beautiful but never proud who could speak well but knew when to be quiet who dressed well but was never overdressed who had self restraint even when she could get what she wanted a woman who never took revenge who overlooked it when people hurt her who was too wise to do anything stupid who could think without revealing her thoughts and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her that kind of woman if she ever existed would  Would do what
Would raise babies and clip coupons
Oh that’s pathetic
Don’t listen to him Emilia even though he’s your husband
What do you think about him Cassio
Isn’t he a horrible man
He speaks bluntly madam
He’s more of a soldier than a wise man
I recognize his trumpet
Yes it is
Let’s go greet him when he lands
Look here he comes
My beautiful warrior
My darling Othello
I’m amazed you got here before me
But I’m overjoyed
If I died right now I’d be completely happy since I’ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life
God willing our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older
Amen to that
I can’t talk about my happiness anymore
It’s too much
Let’s go up to the castle
Good news friends
The war’s over and the Turks are drowned
How are my old friends from this island doing Honey they’ll love you here in Cyprus
And bring the ship’s captain to the castle
He’s a good man Let’s go Desdemona
Meet me down at the harbor Come here
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight
But first I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him
With Cassio
That’s impossible
Be quiet and listen to me
Othello isn’t any of those things
Now if that’s true and it’s obviously true who’s in a better position than Cassio
Besides he’s young and handsome and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for
I can’t believe that
She’s very moral
Like hell she is
If she were so moral she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place
Good lord
Did you see that
They were lusting after each other
Disgusting
But listen to me let me guide you
I brought you here from Venice
Be on guard duty tonight
Cassio doesn’t know you
I’ll be nearby
Make Cassio angry somehow either by speaking too loud or insulting his military skills or however else you want
All right
He’s hot tempered and he might try to hit you with his staff
Try to get him to do that
To get what you want you need to get Cassio out of the way
I’ll do it if you help me out
I promise I will
Meet me in a little while at the citadel
I need to get Othello’s things from the ship
Goodbye
Goodbye
I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him wife for wife
If I can’t do that I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight
For besides the good news we are also celebrating his marriage
That’s the end of the announcement
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello
Iago’s a good man
Goodnight Michael
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can Come with me my dear love
Good night everyone
Hello Iago
It’s time for us to stand guard
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona I can’t blame him
What’s the reason for this horrible shouting
What’s the matter
Sir is everyone in your family at home
Are your doors locked
Why are you asking me that
For God’s sake sir you’ve been robbed
Your heart’s going to break
It’s like half your soul’s been ripped out
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb
Wake up wake up ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens
Get up I tell you
Are you crazy
Do you recognize my voice noble lord
Not me
Who are you
My name’s Roderigo
I told you not to hang around my house
I’ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you
Sir sir sir 
Yes she’s young and tender
Like an invitation
But she’s modest and ladylike too
And when she speaks doesn’t her voice stir up passion
She’s a perfect woman it’s true
Well good luck to them tonight in bed
Not tonight Iago
I’m not much of a drinker
I wish there was less social pressure to drink
Oh but these are our friends
Just one glass
I’ll do most of the drinking for you
I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight watered down but look how drunk I am
What are you talking about man
Tonight is for celebrating
Where are they
By the door
Please invite them in
I’ll do it but I don’t like it
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog
Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island
Here they come
If the future turns out as I hope it will I’m all set for success
My God they’ve given me a lot to drink
No it was a little one not more than a pint
Bring in more wine
My God what a great song
I learned it in England where they have a talent for drinking
The Danes the Germans and the Dutch come on drink drink are nothing compared to the English
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers
They drink Danes under the table and it takes them no effort at all to out drink Germans
Let’s drink to our general
I’ll drink as much as you do
Oh sweet England
God that song’s even better than the other one
Do you want to hear it again
No because we shouldn’t be doing that stuff
Oh well God’s in charge and some people have to go to heaven while other people have to go to hell
That’s true lieutenant
Speaking for myself and no offense to the general or anyone else I hope I’m going to heaven
Me too lieutenant
Okay but please not before me
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign
But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business God forgive our sins Gentlemen let’s get down to business
By the way I don’t want anyone thinking I’m drunk
I’m not drunk
I can stand well enough and I can speak just fine
Yes you’re speaking very well
Yes very well
So don’t think that I’m drunk
It’s too bad
But is he often like this
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep
He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep
The general should be informed about this
Don’t you think so
And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep rooted drinking problem as his second in command
We should definitely say something to the Moor
Well
Now I’ve done a good day’s work
You must all keep up this united front
Don’t simply hide your hatred
Swear your love for each other
On my honor I swear I love Rivers with all my heart
And I love Hastings with all my heart
Take my hand Hastings
Dorset embrace Hastings Hastings express your affection for the marquess of Dorset
I swear I will never break this promise of love
And so do I my lord
Now noble Buckingham seal this alliance by embracing my wife’s friends and make me happy in your unity
Noble Buckingham your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart
And just in time here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen
Happy indeed the way we have spent the day
What blessed work my king
I hate it and want all good men’s love
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day
If only all struggles ended this well
Please pardon our brother Clarence
Why madam have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king
Who doesn’t know that the good duke is dead
Who doesn’t know he’s dead
Who says he is
Oh my God what a terrible world this is
Do I look as pale as everyone else does Lord Dorset
Is Clarence dead
But I reversed the death sentence
Well the poor man died by your first order which was carried by a winged messenger
Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter order who came after Clarence was already buried
It’s clear that someone less noble less loyal more bloody minded than Clarence but not a blood relation deserves as bad an end as my brother but he goes free
Please be quiet
My soul is full of sorrow
I will not rise until your Highness hears me
Then hurry up and tell me what you want
That you lift the death sentence on my servant who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk
We know you have a job to do Brakenbury and we’ll do what you say
Farewell brother
It doesn’t make either of us happy I know
Well your imprisonment won’t last long
I will either get you out lying if I have to or stay in prison in your place
In the meantime be patient
I have no choice
Goodbye
Go walk the path that you will never return from
I love you so much that I’ll send your soul to heaven very soon if heaven will accept anything from me that is
But who’s coming
Good afternoon my dear lord
The same to you my lord
Welcome to the open air again
How did you tolerate prison
But his punishment was bitter death
Who pleaded with me to pardon
This is what happens when you act rashly
Did you notice how the queen’s guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence’s death
Oh they continually urged the king to do it
God will revenge it
But come lords will you come with me to Edward’s room to comfort him
We’ll come with you your Grace
Tell me good grandmother is our father dead
No boy
My pretty children both of you misunderstand me
So you’re admitting Clarence my father is dead
My uncle the king is to blame for this
God will take revenge
And so will I
Quiet children quiet
The king loves you very much
Innocent sweethearts you have no idea who’s responsible for your father’s death
You think my uncle was lying grandmother
Yes boy
I can’t believe that
What’s that noise
I plan to fall into the blackest despair
Why are the branches still living when the root is gone
Why aren’t the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up
If you do intend to live then mourn
If you’re going to die be quick about it so you can catch the king’s departing soul or follow him like obedient subjects to his new kingdom of endless night
Since your woes are only a portion of mine I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own
I could drown the world
My poor husband my dear Edward
Our poor father Clarence
My sons Edward and Clarence
What support did I have other than Edward
And now he’s gone
What support did we have besides our father
And now he’s gone
And now they’re both gone
There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me
There have never been orphans who’ve suffered what we have
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss
Alas I am the mother of all these others' griefs
She weeps for Edward and so do I while she does not weep for Clarence though I do
These young children cry for Clarence and so do I though they don’t cry for Edward as I do
Be a careful mother madam and think about your son the young prince
Your peace of mind depends on him
Sister calm down
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king
On my knee I humbly ask your blessing
God bless you and make you obedient loving and kind
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief now it’s time to cheer each other up with love
Though we have lost a generous king we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again
I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king
Why only a few courtiers my lord of Buckingham
The king made peace among all of us
And so do I I think we all do
So I agree with noble Buckingham only a few should go to meet the prince
I think so too
For God’s sake my lord let’s be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince
Along the way I’ll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen’s proud relatives as step one in the plan we’ve discussed
You are my other self my oracle my prophet my dear brother
Good morrow neighbor whither away so fast
I’m telling you I hardly know myself
Did you hear the news that’s going around
Yes that the king is dead
Neighbors hello
Good day to you sir
Is it true that good King Edward has died
Yes sir it’s all too true God help us
Then gentlemen we can count on trouble
No no with God’s help his son will be king
It’s bad news when a country is ruled by a child
His counselors will govern as long as he’s a minor and then he’ll take over
With patience noble lord as prisoners must
It’s a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please
What’s the news abroad
Very sad
Where is he in his bed
He is
You go ahead and I will follow you
That’s how it was with Henry the Sixth who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old
Really
It would be better if they were all on his father’s side or that there were none at all on his father’s side
Richard the duke of Gloucester is very dangerous and the queen’s sons and brothers are haughty and proud it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects not rulers
Come come we’re worrying about the worst case scenario
I’m sure everything will be fine
When storms arrive early you can expect the harvest will be damaged
So if all turns out fine as you say it’s more than we deserve or I expect
It’s always like this in times of change
But leave it all to God
Where are you all off to
The court has sent for us
They’ll be here tomorrow or the next day
I’m dying to see the prince
I hope he’s grown a lot since I last saw him
Yes mother but I wish I hadn’t
Why dear child
It’s good to grow
Yes” said my uncle Gloucester “Small plants are graceful while ugly weeds grow fast” And since then I’ve wished I wouldn’t grow so fast because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry
Well it certainly wasn’t true for Richard
As a child he took such a long time to grow up that according to his rule he should have grown up into a gracious adult
And no doubt he is gracious madam
I hope he is but mothers get to have their doubts
Hey if I’d remembered something about him I could have had a good comeback for my uncle touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine
What would you have said my young York
Do tell
Indeed they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old
It took me two years before I had a single tooth
Grandmother this would have been a biting joke
Pretty York who told you about his teeth
His nurse grandmother
His nurse
Why she was dead before you were even born
Well if it wasn’t her I don’t know
A mischievous child
Come come you are too clever for your own good
Good lady don’t be angry with the child
Little pitchers have big ears
Here comes a messenger
What’s the news
My lord it’s news I wish I didn’t have to report
How’s the prince
He’s fine and healthy madam
What is your news
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham
What did they do wrong
I’ve told you everything I know
Why the nobles were imprisoned and on what charges I don’t know my gracious lord
Oh no
I see the downfall of my family
Welcome destruction blood and massacre
My husband lost his life to get the crown and my sons' fortunes have been tossed up and down leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses
Let it end or let me die so I won’t have to watch any more of it
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy
It wasn’t the journey itself uncle but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull
I want more uncles here to welcome me
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous
Your Grace heard their saccharine words but didn’t take note of their poisonous intentions
God protect you from them and from other false friends
God should keep me from false friends but they weren’t false
My lord the mayor of London is here to greet you
God bless your Grace with health and happy days
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn’t even arrived to tell us whether they’re coming
And just in time here comes the sweaty lord
Welcome my lord
What isn’t my mother coming
God knows why but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you but his mother wouldn’t let him
I wouldn’t commit so serious a crime for anything
In these less dainty times you’re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him
The prince has done neither therefore in my opinion he isn’t really protected by sanctuary
Often I have heard of “sanctuary men” but until now I’ve never heard of “sanctuary children” My lord you’ve won me over this time
Lord Hastings will you go with me
I’m coming my lord
Go as fast as you can
Say uncle Richard if my brother comes where will I stay till my coronation
Whatever seems best to you
Of all places I don’t like the
He started it my noble lord and succeeding generations rebuilt it
Is it on record that he built it or is it just word of mouth
On record my gracious lord
Well I think that even if it weren’t on record the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next all the way to Doomsday
What did you say uncle
Death didn’t conquer
The king won’t live I hope
I’ll marry the earl of Warwick’s youngest daughter Lady Anne
So what if I killed her husband and her father
So that’s what I’ll do not because I love her but because I’ll get something out of it
But I’m running ahead of myself
Clarence is still alive Edward is not only alive he’s king
Only when they’re dead can I start to count my gains
What my dear lord
Richard of York how are you doing my loving brother
Very well my supreme lord that’s what I have to call you now
How’s my nephew doing noble lord of York
Thank you for asking uncle
Oh my lord you once said that lazy weeds grow fast
The prince has far outgrown me
He has my lord
Does that mean he’s lazy
Oh my handsome nephew I must not say that
In that case he’s more obliged to you than I am
He may command me as my king but you still have power over me as a relative
Uncle please give me your dagger
My dagger little nephew
With all my heart
Are you begging brother
From my kind uncle who I know will give it to me especially as it’s not worth much
I’ll give you a greater gift than that nephew
A greater gift
That must mean a sword
Yes gentle cousin if it were light enough for you
Oh I see you will only part with lightweight presents
For more important things you’ll say no
A sword’s too heavy for you to wear
I wouldn’t think much of it even if it were heavier
What’s that
But uncle you know how to bear with him
You mean to bear me not to bear        My protector Richard insists on it
I can’t sleep quietly in the Tower
Why what are you afraid of
My uncle Clarence’s angry ghost
My grandmother told me he was murdered there
I’m not afraid of dead uncles
Nor living ones I hope
Well I hope not
No doubt no doubt
Oh he’s a dangerously clever boy bold quick witted capable
He’s his mother’s child from head to toe
Well enough about them Come here Catesby
Hastings loved the prince’s father so much that we won’t be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince
What about Stanley
Won’t he join us
He’ll do whatever Hastings does
Okay just do this noble Catesby sound out Lord Hastings but make it seem as if you’re just mulling over the idea that it hasn’t been firmed up yet
If he seems game to our plan encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons
But if he’s resistant and chilly then be like that too and break off the conversation
Give my regards to Hastings Catesby
My good lords I plan to
Will we hear from you before bedtime Catesby
You will my lord
You’ll find us both at Crosby Place
Now my lord what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings won’t go along with our plans
Chop off his head
Whatever we decide to do
And when I’m king remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it which my brother the king used to own
I look forward to that present
You’ll find I’ll give it to you very willingly
Come let’s have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans
A messenger from Lord Stanley
Four o'clock in the morning
Can’t Lord Stanley sleep
I guess not for good reason as you’ll soon hear
First he sends his regards
And then
Besides that he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him who are at the other sorry
While he and I are at one my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other so nothing will happen that we won’t find out about
Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries
And as for his dreams I’m surprised he’s so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night
If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us we’ll only make the boar angry and suspicious causing him to chase us when he never intended to
Good morning my noble lord
Good day Catesby
You’re up early
What news can you tell me in this fast moving unsteady state of ours
I believe it won’t stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm
What do you mean “wears the wreath”
Are you talking about the crown
Yes my good lord
I’ll have my head cut from my shoulders before I’ll see the crown so misplaced
But do you think that’s what he’s aiming for
For that reason he sends you this good news that this very day your enemies the queen’s relatives will die at Pomfret
Well I’m not sorry to hear that because they have always been my enemies
Well let’s hope you stay in that noble frame of mind
But as for now before two weeks have gone by I’m going to send some people packing
It’s a horrible thing to die when you’re not prepared for it my gracious lord
Yes monstrous monstrous
That’s how it will be for some other men too who think they’re as safe as you and I who are well loved by noble Richard and Buckingham
I know they do and I certainly deserve it
You’re afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear
My lord good morning
Good morning Catesby
My lord my life is as important to me as yours is to you and it was never as precious to me as it is now
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didn’t know that our situation was secure
I hope to God I’m proven wrong
Well should we head to the Tower
The day is well on its way
Set down your honorable load men if there is ever any honor in being dead
You know what my lord
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions
But come my lord let’s go
Go on ahead
I’ll talk with this good man
What’s up man
How’s it going
Better since your lordship was nice enough to ask
I tell you man it’s better for me too than the last time we met here
But now I tell you keep it to yourself though those enemies of mine are being put to death today and I’m better than I’ve ever been
Well let’s hope your good fortune continues
Here drink to me
God be good to you
A nice coincidence my lord
I’m glad to see you
I thank you Sir John with all my heart
I am indebted to you for your last sermon
By next week I’ll be able to pay you
Your friends at Pomfret they’re the ones who need a priest
When I ran into this holy man those men you mentioned did come to mind in fact
Are you headed to the Tower
I’ll be off before you are
Yes probably because I’m staying for lunch
I’ll follow you my lord
Hurry up
Your lives are over
Oh Pomfret Pomfret
Oh you bloody prison fatal and threatening to noble lords
Now Margaret’s curse has fallen on our heads for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son
She cursed Hastings then
Oh God remember to hear her prayer for them just as for us
But don’t kill my sister and her royal sons be satisfied dear God with our blood which is being spilled unjustly as you know
Hurry up
The hour of death is approaching
Come Grey
Come Vaughan
Let’s embrace
In God’s name speak
When should the royal day be
Is everything ready for that event
It is
Tomorrow’s a good day
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks
Who’s closest to him
You I think would best know what he’s thinking
We know each other’s faces but as for our thoughts he doesn’t know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his or you do about mine
Lord Hastings you and he are close
Thank you
I know he holds me dear but I haven’t asked him about the coronation and he hasn’t told me
But you my noble lords may name a time and I’ll second it on the duke’s behalf which I don’t think he’ll mind
Right on cue here’s the duke himself
My noble lords and relatives good morning
If you hadn’t shown up on cue my lord Lord Hastings was going to take your part I mean he was going to speak for you in the crowning of the king
No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings
Buckingham I need to have a word with you
I’ll come soon
We have not yet set the coronation day
Where is my lord the duke of Gloucester
I have sent for the strawberries
Richard is looking cheerful today
You always know he’s got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto
I don’t think there’s a man under the sun who’s worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard
I pray to God he isn’t
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes
If they have done this thing my noble lord  If
You lover of that damned whore you’re talking to me of “ifs”
You’re a traitor Off with his head
I pity England but not myself
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him and I laughed and refused to flee with him
Three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the Tower as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse
Oh now I really need that priest who spoke to me today
And I regret having bragged to the messenger about how my enemies were being butchered at Pomfret while I as I said was in good standing with Richard
Oh Margaret Margaret your heavy curse has now landed on poor Hastings’s miserable head
Make your confession short
He’s eager to see your head
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea
Come come hurry up
It’s pointless to talk now
Oh bloody Richard
Miserable England I foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experienced Come lead me to the block
Bring him my head
Those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves
Frightening looks are also at my service as are fake smiles
But has Catesby gone
A drum
And if he ever has a wife let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite
Lord Mayor the reason we have sent  Look behind you
Defend yourself
There are enemies here
God defend and guard us innocents against them
Stay calm
They’re friends Ratcliffe and Lovell
Here’s the head of that notorious traitor the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings
I loved this man so much it makes me weep
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn’t been for his love affair with Shore’s wife I would never have suspected him
He would have
What do you think we’re Turks or savages instead of Christians
I didn’t expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore
But my good lord the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself
That is exactly why we wanted you here your lordship to avoid the public carping and complaints
There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on
And if you need to approach the subject of me tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward my noble father was fighting in France
But only hint at this vaguely because as you know my mother’s still alive
Goodbye my lord
If things go well bring the crowd to  I’m off
Around three or four o'clock look for news from the meeting hall
Lovell go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw
Now I’ll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence’s brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward’s sons
Here’s the indictment of the good Lord Hastings which has been written out in a clear hand like any legal document so it can be read aloud in public outside St Paul’s Cathedral
What a backward world we live in
Why who’s so stupid that he can’t see through this fraud
The world is a bad place where you can’t speak what you know
It’s incredible they didn’t say a word
Did you mention that Edward’s children are bastards
I did
He said that the people weren’t used to being spoken to except by the  What blocks of wood
They wouldn’t say anything
Aren’t the mayor and his fellow citizens coming
The mayor is here at hand
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests okay
But don’t be easily won over
I’m going now
If you’re as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you this will definitely come to a happy end
Hurry go up to the roof
The Lord Mayor is knocking
Welcome my lord
I don’t think he wants to be disturbed
Now Catesby what does your lord say to my request
My lord he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day
Return to the gracious duke good Catesby
Tell him that the mayor some citizens and I have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good
I’ll tell him right away my lord
Ah my lord this prince is nothing like Edward
He’s not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body but praying to nourish his attentive soul
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king
But I’m afraid we’ll never get him to agree to be king
But God forbid he says no to us
I’m afraid he will
Here comes Catesby again
What’s up Catesby what does your master say
My lord he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him since he had no idea they were coming
My lord he’s afraid you mean him harm
I’m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me
When devoutly religious men are praying it’s hard to draw them out of it because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation
See how he stands between two clergymen
My lord you don’t need to apologize
I beg you to pardon me
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better
You have my lord
Sweet saint for goodness’s sake don’t be so angry
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries
It’s your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins
Oh earth which soaks up this blood revenge his death
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him as it does this good king’s blood
If I don’t answer perhaps you’ll think I’m accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me
First of all even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown if it were truly my birthright I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it
So thank God there is no real need for me as I wouldn’t be able to help you much
The royal tree has left us other fruit which with time will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king I’m sure
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy your mother can vouch for that and then he was betrothed to Bona the King of France’s sister in law
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed out widow long past her prime
Don’t refuse the love we offer you
Oh make them joyful
Grant their law abiding request
Alas why would you heap all these responsibilities on me
I am unfit to rule and to be king
Please don’t take it badly but I cannot and will not give in to you
But listen if
Oh please don’t swear my lord of Buckingham
If you refuse it the whole country will regret it
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries
Well call them back again
I am not made of stone I am affected by all these kind pleas though it goes against my conscience and my soul
God bless your Grace
We understand you’re just doing it for us and we’ll be sure to say so
If you say that you’ll only be telling the truth
Then I salute you with this royal title long live Richard England’s worthy king
Amen
Will you be crowned tomorrow
Whenever you want since you’re the one who wants it
Who’s this
My granddaughter with her kind aunt the duchess of Gloucester leading her by the hand
Now on my life the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes whom she adores
Where are you going
Just to the Tower I’m guessing for the same reason you are to salute the noble princes who are staying there
Yes kind sister
We can all go together
And here comes the warden just in time
They’re just fine my dear madam
But I’m sorry I’m not allowed to let you visit them
The king has strictly forbidden it
The king
Who’s that
I meant to say the Lord Protector
The Lord keep him from the title of king
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs
I am their mother
Who’s going to keep me from them
I am their father’s mother
I will see them
I am their aunt and I love them like a mother
So take me to see them
Officer I’ll take the responsibility from you and the blame too
No madam no
I can’t do this
I am bound by oath so please forgive me
In just an hour from now Duchess of York I’ll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens
Oh cut my bodice staps so that my pent up heart can have some room to breathe or I’ll faint from this deadly news
Cruel cruel news
Your mother’s name has become a threat to her own children
I’ll write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf so that he’ll meet you on the way
But don’t delay
O this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery
It has hatched a    I go unwillingly
I wish to God that the golden crown that I’ll have to wear were red hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain
If you want to make me happy don’t wish yourself harm
No
Why
Every night I’m awakened by his  Poor dear goodbye
I pity your situation
No more than I do yours
Goodbye
You are a rude ragged nurse and an old sullen playmate for such tender princes
Please treat my babies well
Dear woman you don’t know the rules of charity
Villain you don’t know the laws of God or of man
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity
If I know nothing about pity that must mean I’m not an animal
It’s even stranger when an angel is so angry
Divine perfect woman give me a chance to prove in detail that I’m innocent of the evils you accuse me of
Contagious infection of humanity give me a chance to condemn you for the evils I know you’ve committed
You who are beautiful beyond words calm down and let me explain myself
You who are wicked beyond belief the only “explanation” I’ll accept from you is for you to hang yourself
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty
My gracious king
Give me your hand
Because of your advice and your help I have a high position now
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time
Let them last forever
Oh Buckingham now I’m going to test to see if you’re truly made of gold
Young Prince Edward is still alive what do you think I’m going to say next
Go on my loving lord
Ha
But Edward is still alive
True noble prince
Oh how bitter it is that Edward the real “true noble prince” should still be alive
Cousin you didn’t used to be so thickheaded
Shall I put it plainly
What do you say
Your Grace can do whatever he wants
Tut tut you’ve become rather icy
Tell me do I have your consent to kill them
Give me a little breathing space my lord a little pause to think
I’ll let you know my answer shortly
My lord
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money
What’s his name
His name is Tyrrel my lord
I know the man a bit
Go bring him here boy
Look who’s here
What’s the news with you
You should know my loving lord I’ve heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany to the earl of Richmond
Come here Catesby
Spread the rumor abroad that Anne my wife is very sick
And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence’s daughter
Look at you standing there in a stupor
I repeat spread the rumor that Anne my wife is sick and likely to die
Are you Tyrrel
James Tyrrel and your most obedient subject
Are you indeed
Do you dare kill a friend of mine
Well that’s what you get to do
Two great enemies in fact enemies to my peace of mind
Tyrrel I mean those bastards in the Tower
Give me access to them and soon you won’t have to worry about them anymore
That’s music to my ears
Come here Tyrrel
By this token you’ll be admitted to their cell
Get up and listen to me
That’s all there is to it
As soon as the deed is done you will be in my favor and I will promote you
I’ll do it right away
My lord I have thought over the request you just made of me
Well it doesn’t matter anymore
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond
I heard the news my lord
Stanley Richmond is your wife’s son
Get information from her
My lord I’d want to have the gift you promised me on your honor the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it
Stanley pay attention to your wife’s doings
If she sends any letters to Richmond you will be accountable to me for it
What do you say your Highness about my just request
As I remember Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy
A king perhaps  My lord  How is it that the prophet didn’t tell me at the time that I would kill him
My lord your promise of the earldom  Richmond
The last time I was in Exeter the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it “ My lord
Yes what time is it
I’m reminding your grace what you promised me
Well but what time is it
It’s almost ten o'clock
Well let it strike ten then
Why “let it strike”
Because you’re like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell you keep interrupting my thoughts
I am not in the giving mood today
You’re bothering me
I’m not in the mood
Is this really happening
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt
Did I work to make him king for this
Oh let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of
Dighton and Forrest whom I hired to perform the butchery are used to killing people the bloody dogs
Their lips like four red roses on a stalk touched
Kind Tyrrel will your news make me happy
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy then be happy because I did it
But did you see them dead
I did my lord
And buried noble Tyrrel
The Tower’s chaplain has buried them but to tell you the truth I don’t know where
Tyrrel come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths
In the meantime think about how I can do you good and give you what you want
See you soon
I humbly say goodbye
Edward’s sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne my wife has bid good night to the world
Now I go a jolly thriving wooer to marry my brother Edward’s young daughter Elizabeth because I know Richmond has his eye on her
My lord
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking
Bad news my lord
The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond and Buckingham backed by a hardy Welsh army is on the march
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army
Let’s say I didn’t kill them
Then you might as well say they’re not dead
But they are dead and you killed them you slave of the devil
I did not kill your husband
Well then he must be alive
You’re lying
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood
She provoked me with her lying mouth accusing me of crimes I didn’t commit
No what provoked you was your own bloody mind which never thinks about anything but butchering
You killed this king didn’t you
Yes I’ll grant you that
You’ll grant me you hedgehog
Then let God grant me that you’ll be damned for that wicked deed
Oh he was gentle mild and virtuous
That will please God who has him now
He is in heaven where you will never go
Let him thank me who helped him get there
I’ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies
I’ll head to France soon
It’s time to hide wretched Margaret
Who’s coming
Ah my poor princes
If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother’s lament
Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved with her children dead before their time
I’ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute
Edward Plantagenet why are you dead
Will you abandon such gentle lambs God and throw them to the wolves
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done
Let my sorrow have the upper hand
You had a Clarence too and Richard killed him
Oh righteous God how can I thank you enough that this meat eating mutt preys on his mother’s children and forces her to join others in their grief
O Harry’s wife do not triumph in my sorrow
With God as my witness I swear I have wept for yours
Your son Edward who stabbed my son Edward is dead
Your Clarence who stabbed my Edward is also dead
Richard a fiendish spy for hell itself still lives but only long enough to buy souls to send below
I pray that God ends his life before I die so I can say “The dog is dead”
Oh you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider that hideous toad
Back then I called you “a poor imitation queen” a badly reproduced copy of what I was a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell a mother only teased with two beautiful children who would soon die
And I was right because where’s your husband now
Your brothers
Your two sons
Now you have only the memory of what you were which tortures you when you consider what you’ve become
You once stole my position now you get to have the grief that goes with it
Your English sorrows will make me smile in France
You who are so skilled in cursing stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies
Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse
Think like this all day and you’ll learn how to curse
My words are dull
Enliven them with yours
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine
But give words a chance
If that’s true then don’t be tongue tied
Come with me and let’s smother my fiendish son who smothered your two sweet sons in bitter words
Who’s blocking the way
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you’ve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown when if there was any justice in this world it should be branded with the murders you committed your slaughter of the prince who held that crown and of my sons and my brothers
Tell me you villainous lowlife where are my children
Where are the noble Hastings Rivers Vaughan Grey
Where is kind Hastings
Play trumpets
Don’t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord’s anointed king
Play I say
Either be calm and polite or I’ll drown you out with the music of war
Are you my son
Yes I thank God my father and yourself
Then patiently listen to my impatience
Madam I’m a bit like you in that I can’t tolerate a tone of disapproval
Oh let me speak
Go ahead but I won’t listen
I’ll be gentle and mild
And brief good mother I’m in a hurry
Are you that impatient
God knows I waited for you in anguish pain and agony when I gave birth to you
And didn’t I finally arrive to comfort you
So what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company
Name one
You’re too bitter
Just listen this once
I’ll never speak to you again
So be it
Though I have far more reason I don’t have as much energy to curse you
But I say amen to everything she said
Wait madam
I need to speak a word with you
I have no more royal sons for you to murder
You have a daughter named Elizabeth who is virtuous and beautiful aristocratic and full of grace
And does she have to die for this
Oh let her live and I’ll ruin her manners and her beauty
So that she may live I’ll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child
Don’t wrong her birth
She has royal blood
To save her life I’ll say she doesn’t
Yes as safe as her brothers' lives were
Bad friends were
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts you’re the one who gave the order
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart you reveled in my lambs' bloody guts
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame so I’m not going to say any more about my boys until I’ve gouged your eyes out with my bare hands
Madam if I do as well as I think I’m going to do in these dangerous violent wars you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you’ve ever had bad
What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now
The advancement of your children noble lady
Advancement to some scaffold to lose their heads
No advancement to the dignity and height of honor to a high imperial kind of glory
And you’re not suited for any place except hell
Yes and one other place if you’ll only let me name it
Some dungeon
Your bedroom
There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are
Exactly madam until I sleep with you
Well explain but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn’t used up by talking about it
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter
I believe it
What do you believe
That you love my daughter to spite your soul
Don’t be so quick to twist my meaning
The one who makes her queen of course
Who else should it be
What you
What do you think madam
How would you woo her
And  Madam with all my heart
Come come you’re making fun of me
This is not the way to win your daughter
There isn’t any other way unless you took on another form and became someone else
But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her
Then she has no choice but to hate you as you purchased her love with murder
Whatever has already been done can’t be undone now
Men act imprudently sometimes then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them
If I took the kingdom from your sons I’ll give it to your daughter to make up for it
If I have killed your children I will have children with your daughter
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is
Your children caused you trouble in your youth but mine will bring you comfort in your old age
I can’t make up for everything that I’d like to so accept such kindness as I can offer
Indeed we have many good days to look forward to
Go then mother to your daughter
What should I say to her
That her father’s brother wants to be her husband
Or should I say it’s her uncle
Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God the law my honor and her feelings
Claim fair England’s peace depends on this alliance
She will purchase that peace with an everlasting war
Tell her that the king who has the power to command people asks her
He asks her to do what God  Say she will be a high and mighty queen
Only to watch that title become worthless as her mother has
Say I will love her everlastingly
But how long will “ever” last
Until her beautiful life’s end
But how long will her beautiful life last
As long as heaven and nature extend it
As long as hell and Richard want it
Tell her that I her king am her lowly subject
But she your subject hates such a king
Be eloquent on my behalf
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms
You can’t tell a story simply when it’s a lie
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty
Oh no my reasons are deep and as permanent as death
Don’t harp on that point madam it’s past
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break
Now by St George my knighthood and my crown  The first you profaned the second you dishonored and the third you stole
I swear  By nothing because this is no oath
St George loses his holiness once  Then by myself  You’ve misused yourself
Now by the world  It’s full of your ugly wrongdoings
By my father’s death  Your life has dishonored his death
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child and both princes would still be alive not preyed on by worms
What can you swear by now
By the future
There are parents living whose children you have butchered they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old
Don’t swear by the future because you’ve ruined it before it has even arrived
May I only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere
Let me destroy myself let heaven and destiny deprive me of happy hours let day remain dark and night sleepless and let me have nothing but terrible luck if I do not love with a pure heart clean devotion and holy thoughts your beautiful royal daughter
My happiness and yours lie in her
It
Shall I be tempted by the devil
Yes if the devil tempts you to do good
Yes if your memories do you no good
Yet you killed my children
But in your daughter’s womb I will bury them
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you
And be a happy mother by doing so
I’m going
Write to me very soon and I’ll let you know what she thinks
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren’t willing to beat it back
Word is that Richmond is the navy’s admiral
Someone who can ride fast go to the duke of  Here my good lord
Catesby fly to the duke
I will my lord as fast as I can
Ratcliffe come here
Ride to Salisbury
Oh right good Catesby
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury
I’m off
What would you like me to do at Salisbury
Why what is there to do before I get there
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you
I changed my mind
Stanley what news do you have
Nothing that you want to hear my lord but nothing so bad that I can’t mention it
Well how nice a riddle
Neither good nor bad
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point
Once again what’s the news
Richmond is sailing on the sea
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him
Lily livered coward what’s he doing there
Well what do you guess
That stirred up by Dorset Buckingham and Morton he’s coming to England to claim the crown
They are my daylight my life
Then I hope night shadows your day and death takes your life
Don’t damn yourself
I wish I were so I could deprive you of both day and life
There is no better one on earth
Is the throne empty
Is the army without a leader
Is the king dead the empire dispossessed
What heir of the York family is there alive other than myself
And who is England’s king but an heir of the great York
Therefore tell me what is he doing at sea
Where is your army then to beat him back
Where are your tenants and your followers
Aren’t they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships
Then they’re cold friends to me
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king
They haven’t been commanded to go to the west mighty king
If your Majesty would like I’ll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like
Most mighty sovereign you have no reason to doubt my friendship
I was never disloyal and I never will be
Then go gather your men but leave behind your son George Stanley
My noble king my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother the haughty Bishop of Exeter are now in  My king the Guildfords in  My lord the duke of Buckingham’s army  Enough you
The news I have to tell your majesty is that Buckingham’s army has dispersed from sudden floods and heavy rainfall
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where
I beg your pardon
Yes your Highness
Even if we don’t fight foreign enemies we’ll beat down these rebels at home
While we’re talking here a royal battle could be won and lost
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury
Everyone else march on with me
But tell me where is the noble Richmond now
At Pembroke or at Harfordwest in Wales
Sir Walter Herbert a renowned soldier Sir Gilbert Talbot Sir William Stanley Oxford the highly feared Pembroke Sir James Blunt Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew and many other famous and powerful noblemen
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads
I’m left with nothing to do in this weak idle peacetime unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about
Won’t King Richard let me speak with him
No my good lord
So be calm
Hastings and Edward’s children Rivers and Grey holy King Henry and your fine son Edward Vaughan and all who have died from underhanded corrupt fiendish injustice if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds enjoy the revenge laugh at my ruin
This is  It is my lord
Why then it’s my body’s doomsday
Today I’m going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edward’s children or his wife’s allies
This is the day I’m going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me
This this All Souls' day is my just desserts
I tried to play games with God and he turned my fake prayer on my head giving me for real what I’d asked for as a joke
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves
I have done wrong so I will suffer wrong
I suspect his friends will join us
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him
In his greatest need even they will desert him
All to our advantage
So in God’s name let’s march
Hope with good cause is swift it flies as fast as a swallow
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks
My Lord of Norfolk  Here most gracious king
Norfolk we’re going to have a few blows right
We’ve got to give them and take them my lord
I’ll lie here tonight
But where will I lie tomorrow
Well it doesn’t matter
Six or seven thousand at most
Why our troops amount to three times that
Besides the king’s name is a tower of strength the opposition doesn’t have that advantage
Let’s be disciplined and not delay because tomorrow is a busy day
My Lord of Oxford you Sir William Brandon and you Sir Walter Herbert are going to stay with me
Good Captain Blunt tell the earl goodnight from me and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent
Unless I’ve mistaken his battle flags which I’m sure I haven’t his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king’s mighty army
If it’s possible to do this without putting yourself in danger dear Captain Blunt say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note
Upon my life my lord I’ll do it
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could
Name him
Plantagenet
Yes that’s my husband’s name
Someone else has the same name but he’s a better man
Where is this man
Here
Why do you spit at me
If only I could spit poison
Poison never came from such a sweet place
Poison never landed on such an ugly toad
Get out of my sight
You’re poisoning my eyes
Your beautiful eyes sweet lady have infected mine with love
I wish my eyes were
Good night dear Captain Blunt
Come gentlemen let’s discuss tomorrow’s action in my tent
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors
What time is it
It’s dinnertime my lord
It’s nine o'clock
I’m not going to eat dinner tonight
Give me some ink and paper
Is the visor of my helmet working better now
And has my armor been put in my tent
My good man Norfolk hurry to your post
I’m off my lord
Get up early tomorrow at the sound of the lark noble Norfolk
I will my lord
Catesby
Yes my lord
Yes my lord
Did you see the gloomy Lord Northumberland
Thomas the earl of Surrey and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers
Good I’m satisfied
Set it down
Is my ink and paper ready
It is my lord
Ratcliffe around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor
Now leave me alone as I said
Let fortune and victory be yours
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer noble father in law
Tell me how is my mother
Your mother sends her blessings
To be brief as the occasion requires prepare to fight early in the morning when your future will be decided
I can’t do everything I want to but I’ll help you as well as I can
But I can’t be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother young George
Farewell
The lack of time and the risk I’m under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other’s news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long
I hope we have the time some day
Again goodbye
Be brave and do well
Again good night kind lords and gentlemen
Oh God whose side I think I’m fighting on look kindly on my forces
Make us your agents of revenge so we can praise you when we’re victorious
Before I fall asleep I entrust my soul to you
Defend me God both when I’m asleep and when I’m awake
I’m sweating and trembling with fear
Myself
Yes I am
Then run away
What from myself
Why
Did I do anything good to myself
Oh no
I am a villain
Fool do not flatter yourself
Give me another horse
Bandage my wounds
Have mercy Jesus Wait I was only dreaming
Oh cowardly conscience how you’re torturing me
But what am I afraid of
Myself
There’s no one else here
Richard loves Richard that is there’s just me and myself here
Is there a murderer here
No
Yes I am
Then run away
What from myself
Unfortunately I love myself
Why
Did I do anything good to myself
Oh no
Alas I hate myself instead because of the hateful deeds I’ve committed
I am a villain
Fool speak well of yourself
Fool do not flatter yourself
My lord
Damn it who’s there
Ratcliffe my lord it’s me
The rooster has already crowed twice
Your friends are up and buckling on their armor
Oh Ratcliffe I had a terrifying dream
What do you think will my friends prove loyal
No doubt my lord
By St Paul ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless Richmond’s soldiers could dressed up in their most sword proof armor
It’s not yet daylight
Come with me I’ll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me
Good morning Richmond
Pardon me lords and gentlemen who stayed awake
How did you sleep my lord
Since you left I’ve been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams I’ve ever had my lords
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory
I tell you I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream
How late is it lords
It’s almost four
Why then it’s time to put on my armor and instruct the troops
We have God and a good cause on our side
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high walled fortresses
Other than Richard even those whom we fight against would rather we won
Because who is this man they follow
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed
When you fight against your country’s enemies you will be paid for your efforts with your country’s wealth
If you fight to protect your wives your wives will welcome you home as conquerors
When you free your children from the sword your grandchildren will repay you in your old age
So in the name of God and all the good that will come of this
I wish they were so that I could die right now because at this point I live a living death
I never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words
If your vengeful heart can’t forgive me here take my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul which adores you can be free
No don’t pause because I
What did Northumberland say about Richmond
That he was never trained as a soldier
That’s true
And what did Surrey say to that
He smiled and said “The better for us” He’s right and that’s how it is
Read the time there
Give me an almanac
I didn’t my lord
Ratcliffe
My lord
The sun will not appear today
The sky frowns and scowls on our army
I wish there wasn’t so much dew on the ground
So the sun won’t shine today
Get ready my lord
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield
Hurry hurry prepare my horse
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers
I’ll follow in the center of the troop formation which I’ll defend with my best horse and with Saint George on my side as well
What do you think Norfolk
A good plan warrior king
I found this pinned to my tent this morning
Listen
I hear their drums
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking
What does Lord Stanley say
Will he bring his army
My lord he refuses to come
Off with his son George’s head
My lord the enemy has already passed the marsh
Let George Stanley die after the battle
Let’s go
Victory is with us
Help my lord of Norfolk help help
The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible challenging every enemy he sees
His horse is killed so he’s fighting on foot risking his life to search out Richmond
Help dear lord or the battle will be lost
A horse a horse I’d give my kingdom for a horse
Get off the field my lord
I’ll find you another horse
God and your work be praised victorious friends
Great God of heaven say amen to all this
But tell me is young George Stanley alive
He is my lord and safe in Leicester where if you’d like we can retreat to
John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon
As I vowed I will unite the York and Lancaster families
Smile then on this beautiful union
What traitor hears me and doesn’t say amen
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth the true heirs of each royal house be joined together
Gracious Lord blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again
Let those who would mar this fair land’s peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth
Civil wounds now can heal and peace can live again
So that England may live a long life like this let God say amen
Take up the sword again or take me up
Get up liar
Though I wish you were dead I’m not going to be the one to kill you
I have already
You said it when you were furious
Say it again just one word and my hand which killed your lover out of love will kill your far truer lover
You will be an accessory to both crimes
I wish I knew what was in your heart
I’ve told you
I fear that your words and your heart are both false
Then no man has ever been honest
Well then put your sword away
Tell me that you’ll accept my love
You’ll know about that later
But can I have some hope
I’d like to think all men have some hope
Please wear this ring
Wear both the ring and my heart because both are yours
And if I your poor devoted servant may ask you for one small favor you will guarantee my happiness forever
What’s that
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial as I have more reason to mourn than you do
For various reasons that must remain secret please do this for me
I’ll do it with all my heart
Say goodbye to me
Sirs take up the corpse
Toward Chertsey noble lord
No to the Whitefriars monastery
Wait for me there
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind
And has anyone ever won her as I’ve done
I’ll get her but I won’t keep her long
And yet against all odds I win her over
Ha
Has she already forgotten her brave husband Prince Edward whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger
He was graced with lots of natural gifts he was young valiant wise and no doubt meant to be king
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me who cut her sweet prince’s life short and made her a widow
On me though I am barely half the man that Edward was
On me though I am limping and deformed
I bet I’ve been wrong about myself all this time
Even though I don’t see it this lady thinks I’m a marvelously good looking man
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions
Since I’m suddenly all the rage it will be worth the cost
But first I’ll dump this fellow in his grave then return to my love weeping with grief
Come out beautiful sun until I’ve bought a mirror to admire my reflection in I’ll watch my shadow as I stroll along
Be patient madam
I’m sure his majesty will recover his health soon
Then you’ll be able to cheer  If he were dead what would happen to me
But he’s young and as long as he’s too young to become king Richard the duke of Gloucester has power over him
Richard loves neither me nor any of you
Has it been decided that Richard will be  It’s been decided though not yet officially announced
I hope God makes you happy again like you once were
Did you see the king today Lord Derby
Yes the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him
What are the chances of his getting better lords
Madam keep up hope
He seems cheerful
God give him health
Did you talk with him
Yes madam
I wish I could believe you that all was well
They’re out to get me and I won’t stand for it
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don’t like them
Can’t a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick sneaky lowlifes
Which of us are you referring to
You who are neither honest nor good
When did I ever do you any harm
Or any of you
Damn you all
The king whom I hope God will protect better than you would like can’t get a minute’s rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints
Brother you’ve made a mistake
He  I can’t tell what’s going on
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost
Come come I know what you’re referring to Richard
You resent my friends' rise in society and my own
Let’s hope we never need your help for anything
Meanwhile we’re the ones who need you
My brother is imprisoned because of you I am disgraced and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren’t worth a dime have suddenly been promoted
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence
Since I can’t amuse myself by being a lover I’ve decided to become a villain
I’ve set dangerous plans in motion using lies drunken prophecies and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the  You’re being arrested
Why
Because my name is George
That’s not your fault
He should imprison the person who named you instead
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed
But really what’s going on Clarence
Can you tell me
She could even what
Certainly your grandmother had a worse match
My lord of Gloucester I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long
By God I will tell the king about these taunts
I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment
I’ve had very little joy as England’s queen
If you were king we would do the same
If I were king
I’d rather be a peddler
Hear me you wrangling pirates
Which of you does not tremble when you see me
Ugly wrinkled witch what are you doing here
Only describing what you have ruined
Or at least that’s what I plan to do before I let you go
Weren’t you banished on pain of death
I was
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me
Oh killing that child was the dirtiest most merciless deed there ever was
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it
Even  What were you all snarling before I arrived ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs but now that I’m here you turn your hatred toward me
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland
Enough of your magic spells you hateful withered hag
And leave you out
Don’t move dog
It’s your turn now
Richard
Yes
I didn’t call you
I beg your pardon I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names
Yes I was but I don’t want an answer from you
Let me finish my curse
I’ve finished it for you and it ends in “Margaret” He’s turned your curse against you Margaret
Poor imitation queen why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he’s got you trapped in his deadly web
The day will come when you’ll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous hunchbacked toad
Woman stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you
Shame on you I’ve already run out of patience with you all
If you got what you deserved you would learn some respect
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen and what you deserve is to act like my subjects
Give me what I deserve and do your duty
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind and when they fall they shatter into pieces
Good advice indeed
Take it to heart Dorset
It applies to you as much as to me my lord
But you turn that sun into a shadow
You are building your nest in
Stop if you can’t be kind at least have some shame
How dare you talk about kindness or shame
Enough enough
Your clothes aren’t spattered with my family’s blood and you aren’t affected by my curse
No one here is affected by your curse because curses are just words with no power
What is she saying my lord
Nothing that interests me my good lord
What you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I’m warning you about
Her curses have made my hair stand on end
Mine too
I don’t understand why she’s not locked up
I can’t blame her
I never caused her any harm as far as I know
But you have all the advantages from the harm done
And look how he’s repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence’s troubles
I always pray for them
I’ll tell you as soon as I know Richard because at this point I have no idea
He picked out the letter “G” from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that “G” will take the throne away from his children
He thinks “G” is me
Well this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women
The king isn’t the one sending you to the Tower Clarence
It’s his wife Lady Grey who got him to do this
Madam his majesty asks for you and for you Duke of Gloucester and for you my noble lords
We will wait on you your majesty
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels
Dressing my out and out wickedness in scraps of Scripture I look like a saint exactly when I’m most like the devil
But quiet
Are you going to take care of this thing now
We are my lord
Good thinking
I have it on me here
Tut tut my lord we’re not going to stand around chit chatting
Talkers aren’t good doers
Rest assured that we’re going there to use our hands not our tongues
When fools cry you remain stony
I like you guys
Hurry now get the job done
We will my noble lord
Why do you look so depressed today your Grace
What was your dream
Tell me
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him
Looking toward England we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we’d had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters
Lord how painful it was to drown
I saw a thousand shipwrecks a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone huge anchors chunks of gold heaps of pearls and precious jewels all scattered on the bottom of the sea
So you had time as you were dying to look around
It wouldn’t let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body
In fact the real nightmare had only just begun
With the help of the grim  The first to greet me there was my great
Clarence has arrived lying cowardly  I’m not surprised it scared you my lord
It scares me just to hear you talk about it
I did them for Edward’s sake and look how he rewards me Oh God if my prayers don’t satisfy you and you have to avenge the wrongs I’ve done at least punish me alone
Please spare my innocent wife and children Kind warden please stay with me for a while
I’m feeling very low and I need to sleep
I’ll stay my lord
May God bring you sleep
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons
The only glory princes have are their titles
What do you want fellow
And how did you get in here
I want to speak with Clarence and I came here on my legs
That’s it
Well sir it’s better to say little than to be tedious
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you
Here are the keys and there is the duke sleeping
You may sir
That’s a wise idea
Goodbye
What should I stab him while he sleeps
No
When he wakes up
Why he won’t wake up till Judgment Day
Okay so that’s when he’ll say we stabbed him in his sleep
That word “judgment” makes me feel a bit guilty
What are you afraid
Not of killing him because I have a warrant for it but of being damned for killing him which no warrant can protect me from
I thought you were resolved to do this
I am resolved to let him live
I’ll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so
Please just wait a minute
I’m hoping my holy mood will pass
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds
How are you feeling now
Actually I’m still feeling some pangs of conscience
Remember the reward we’re getting when the deed’s done
Jesus let’s kill him
I forgot about the reward
Where’s your conscience now
Oh in the duke of Gloucester’s wallet
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay your conscience will fly out
It won’t matter
Let it fly out
No one will listen to it
And what will you do if it returns to you
I won’t bother with it
It blushes is easily embarrassed and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart
I’m strong willed
He won’t get the better of me
Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation
Shall we get to work
We’ll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room
What an excellent idea he’ll soak up the wine
Strike
No first let’s talk to him
Where are you keeper
Give me a cup of wine
You’ll have wine enough my lord soon
In God’s name who are you
A man like you
But not a member of the royal family like me
And you’re not loyal like us
Your voice is loud and commanding but you look like a working man
I’m speaking for the king but I look like myself
Your eyes look threatening
And why are you so pale
Who sent you here
Why are you here
To to to  To murder me
Yes
You barely have the heart to tell me so you can’t possibly have the nerve to do it
Besides how have I offended you my friends
You didn’t offend us you offended the king
He and I will make up
Never my lord
So prepare to die
It’s your job in life to kill the innocent
What did I do wrong
Where’s the evidence against me
Where’s the jury the judge the lawful proceedings the verdict
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful
If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ’s dear blood which He shed for our terrible sins you must leave and keep your hands off me
What we do we have been commanded to do
All right
If you like Brakenbury you can listen to anything we say
We’re not saying anything treasonous man
We say the king is wise and good and his noble queen is getting old pretty and not jealous
And that Mr Shore’s wife has nice feet cherry lips pretty eyes and a very pleasant way of expressing herself
What do you think
Is there anything inaccurate in that
I have nothing to do with what you’re talking about my lord
Her husband you rascal
Are you going to get me in trouble
I beg your
And the one who commands us is our king
He does and now he’s taking revenge on you for breaking promises and for murder too
Whom you swore you would protect and defend
How dare you tell us about God’s laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed
For my brother Edward’s sake
If God will be revenged for this deed he will do it publicly
God doesn’t need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him
My brother’s love the devil and my own anger made me do it
I am his brother and I love him very much
You’re mistaken
Richard the duke of Gloucester hates you
No he loves and cherishes me
Go to him from me
We will
Tell him that when our noble father the duke of York gave his three sons his blessing he never imagined that our friendship would come to this
Remind Richard of this and he will weep
Yes he’ll weep stones as he taught us to do
Yes as kind as snow to a harvest
Come on you’re fooling yourself
It’s Richard who sent us here to slaughter you
Well that’s what he’s doing making you free to enjoy heaven
Make peace with God for you must die my lord
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to “make peace with God” but you’re willing to go to war with God by murdering me
Oh sirs consider this those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it
Relent and save your souls
If either of you were a prince’s son and you were imprisoned as I am now and two murderers like yourselves came to you wouldn’t you beg for your life
Yes you would beg if you were in my position
Relent
No
That’s cowardly and womanish
Look behind you my lord
Take that and that
A  What’s going on
What did you mean by not helping me
By God I’m going to tell the duke how slack you’ve been
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother
I’m not
Go coward that you are
Well I’ll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial
And when I get my reward I’ll get out of here
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution
I love rich Capulet’s daughter
We’re bound to each other in every possible way except we need you to marry us
I’ll tell you more later about when and where we met how we fell in love and how we exchanged promises but now I’m begging you please agree to marry us today
Holy Saint Francis this is a drastic change
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline whom you loved so much
Then young men love with their eyes not with their hearts
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears
There’s still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn’t been washed off yet
If you were ever yourself and this sadness was yours you and your sadness were all for Rosaline
And now you’ve changed
Then repeat this after me you can’t expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline
I scolded you for obsessing about her not for loving her my student
And you told me to bury my love
I didn’t tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another
Please I beg you don’t scold me
The other girl did not love me
Oh she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means
But come on inconsistent young man come with me
Let’s get out of here
I’m in a rush
Go wisely and slowly
Those who rush stumble and fall
Where the devil can Romeo be
Didn’t he come home last night
Not to his father’s house
I asked a servant
That fair skinned hard hearted hussy Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane
Tybalt old Capulet’s nephew has sent a letter to Romeo’s father’s house
I bet it’s a challenge
Romeo will answer the challenge
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter
No Romeo will respond to the letter’s writer telling him whether he accepts the challenge
Oh poor Romeo
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt
Why what’s Tybalt’s story
He knows what
He looks skinny like a dried herring without its eggs and he hasn’t got his girl
O flesh flesh you’ve turned pale and weak like a fish
Now he’s ready for
Good morning to you both
What do you mean I faked you out
You gave us the slip sir the slip
Can’t you understand what I’m saying
The  Right
My employer is as good as yours
But he’s not better than mine
Well then
You lie
Gregory remember how to slash
What
Come break this up Benvolio
I’m losing this duel of wits
Keep going keep going or I’ll declare myself the winner
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose
You were never with me for anything if you weren’t there for the goose
I’ll bite you on the ear for that joke
No good goose don’t bite me
Your joke is a very bitter apple
Your humor is a spicy sauce
Then isn’t it just the right dish for a sweet goose
Oh that’s a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard
I stretch my joke for that word “fat” If you add that word to the word “goose” it shows that you are a fat goose
Why isn’t all this joking better than groaning about love
Now you’re sociable
Now you’re Romeo
Oh you’re wrong
I would have made it short
I had come to the deepest part of my tale and I planned to say nothing more on the topic
Here’s something good
There’s two a man and a woman
Peter
I’m at your service
Give me my fan Peter
Good morning gentlemen
Good afternoon fair lady
Is it now afternoon
It’s not earlier than that I tell you
The  Get out of here
What kind of man are you
I’m a man my lady that God has made for himself to ruin
I swear you speak the truth
For himself to ruin” he says
Gentlemen can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo
I can tell you but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him
I am the youngest man by that name because there is no one younger or worse
You speak well
Is the worst well
Very well taken I believe very wise
She will  A pimp
I’ve found it out
What have you found out
Romeo are you going to your father’s for lunch
Let’s go there
I’ll follow after you
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month
If he says anything against me I’ll humble him even if he were stronger than he is and twenty punks like him
If I can’t do it myself I’ll find someone who can
That dirty rat
I’m not one of his sluts
I’m not one of his punk friends who carries a knife
I didn’t see anybody use you for kicks
If I had seen something like that I would have quickly pulled out my weapon
Believe me I’ll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side
Now I swear I’m so angry that I’m shaking all over
That rotten scoundrel
Nurse give my regards to to your lady
I swear to you  You have a good heart and believe me I’ll tell her that
Lord Lord she’ll be a happy woman
What are you going to tell her Nurse
You’re not paying attention to me
At Friar Lawrence’s cell she can make confession and be married
Wait good Nurse
Within an hour one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder
Goodbye
Be honest and helpful and I’ll repay you for your efforts
Goodbye
Sing my praises to your mistress
May God in heaven bless you
Now please listen sir
What do you have to say my dear Nurse
Can your man keep a secret
Haven’t you ever heard the saying “Two can conspire to put one away”
I assure you my man is as true as steel
Well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady
Lord Lord when she was a little baby Oh there is one nobleman in the city a guy named Paris who would be happy to claim her as his own
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are
But when I say so I swear she turns white as a sheet
Don’t “ Yes Nurse what about that
They both begin with the letter “R” Ah you jokester that’s the dog’s name
Give my compliments to your lady
Yes a thousand times
Peter
I’m ready
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock
Maybe she can’t find him
That can’t be
Oh she’s slow
Love’s messengers should be thoughts which fly ten times faster than sunbeams
That’s three hours since nine o'clock but she hasn’t come back
If she was young and passionate she’d move as fast as a ball
My words would bounce her to my sweet love and his words would bounce her back to me
But a lot of old people act like they’re already dead sluggish slow fat and colorless like lead
Oh sweet Nurse what news do you bring
Have you spoken to him
Send your man away
Peter wait for me at the gate
Now good sweet Nurse Oh Lord why do you look so sad
Even if the news is sad tell me with a smile on your face
If the news is good you’re ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that
I am tired
Leave me alone for a minute
Oh my my bones ache so much
I wish you had my bones and I had your news
Can’t you wait for a moment
Don’t you see that I’m out of breath
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself
Is the news good or bad
Answer that question
Tell me if it’s good or bad and I’ll wait for the details
Tell me so I can be satisfied
Is it good or bad
Well you have made a foolish choice
You don’t know how to pick a man
Romeo
No not him though his face is more handsome than any man’s and his legs are prettier and as for his hands and feet and body they’re not much to speak of and yet they’re beyond compare
He’s not the most polite man in the world but believe me he’s gentle as a lamb
Well do what you want
Be good
Have you had lunch yet
No I haven’t had lunch
Everything you told me I already knew
What does he say about our marriage
What about that
My head is pounding
My back aches too 
Believe me I’m sorry you’re in pain
Sweet sweet sweet Nurse tell me what did my love Romeo say
Your love says like an honorable gentleman who is courteous kind handsome and I believe virtuous  where is your mother
Where is my mother
Why she’s inside
Where else would she be
Your answer is so strange
Your love says like an honorable gentleman 'Where is your mother
Are you this impatient
Come on you’re being ridiculous
Is this the cure for my aching bones
From now on take care of your messages yourself
You’re making such a fuss
Come on what did Romeo say
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today
I do
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell
There’s a husband there who’s waiting to make you his wife
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news
Go to the church
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark
Go
I’ll go to lunch
You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell
I’m only trying to keep the peace
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight
What
I hate the word peace like I hate hell all Montagues and you
Let’s go at it coward
Use your clubs and spears
Hit them
Beat them down
Down with the Capulets
Down with the Montagues
What’s this noise
I want my sword
Old Montague is here and he’s waving his sword around just to make me mad
Capulet you villain
You’re not taking one step toward an enemy
Wish me luck
Thank you dear Nurse
Amen amen
But whatever misfortunes occur they can’t ruin the joy I feel with one look at her
Therefore love each other in moderation
That is the key to long lasting love
Too fast is as bad as too slow
Here comes the lady
Oha footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life
That’s how flimsy and unreal pleasure is
Romeo will thank you my girl for both of us
I’ll give him equal thanks so we’re even
Ah Juliet if you’re as happy as I am and you’re better with words tell me about the happiness you imagine we’ll have in our marriage
I can imagine more than I can say I have more on my mind than words
Come come with me and we’ll do the job quickly
I’m begging you good Mercutio let’s call it a day
You’re like one of those guys who walks into a bar slams his sword on the table and then says “I pray I never have to use you” By the time he orders his second drink he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all
Am I really like one of those guys
Come on you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you’re in the mood
And what about that
If there were two men like you pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard
You’ll fight with a man who’s cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut colored eyes
Only you would look for a fight like that
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun
Didn’t you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces
And yet you’re the one who wants to teach me about restraint
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are my life insurance rates would be sky high
Your life insurance
That’s foolish
Oh great here come the Capulets
Well well I don’t care
Put it together with something else
Make it a word and a blow
You’ll find me ready enough to do that sir if you give me a reason
Can’t you find a reason without my giving you one
Mercutio you hang out with Romeo
Hang out” Who do you think we are musicians in a band
If we look like musicians to you you can expect to hear nothing but noise
We’re talking here in a public place
Either go someplace private or talk it over rationally or else just go away
Out here everybody can see us
Men’s eyes were made to see things so let them watch
I won’t move to please anybody
Well may peace be with you
Here comes my man the man I’m looking for
He’s not your man
Tybalt I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult
I am no villain
So goodbye
I can tell that you don’t know who I am
Boy your words can’t excuse the harm you’ve done to me
So now turn and draw your sword
And so good Capulet which is a name I love like my own name you should be satisfied with what I say
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile
What do you want from me
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath
Hurry up or I’ll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn
I’ll fight you
Noble Mercutio put your sword away
Let’s get away Tybalt
I’ve been hurt
May a plague curse both your families
I’m finished
Did he get away clean
What are you hurt
But it’s enough
Where is my page
Have courage man
The wound can’t be that bad
No it’s not as deep as a well or as wide as a church door but it’s enough
Ask for me tomorrow and you’ll find me in a grave
I’m done for in this world I believe
May a plague strike both your houses
I can’t believe that dog that rat that mouse that cat could scratch me to death
That braggart punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual
Why the hell did you come in between us
He struck me from under your arm
I thought it was the right thing to do
Take me inside some house Benvolio or I’ll pass out
May a plague strike both your families
They’ve turned me into food for worms
I’m done for
Curse your families
Oh Romeo Romeo brave Mercutio is dead
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again
He’s alive and victorious and Mercutio’s dead
Either you or I or both of us have to go with him
Wretched boy you hung out with him here and you’re going to go to heaven with him
This fight will decide who dies
Romeo get out of here
The citizens are around and Tybalt is dead
Don’t stand there shocked
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught
So get out of here
Why are you waiting
The man who killed Mercutio which way did he go
Tybalt that murderer which way did he run
Tybalt is lying over there
Speak nephew
Were you here when it started
Where are the evil men who started this fight
Oh noble prince I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight
He killed your relative brave Mercutio and then young Romeo killed him
Tybalt was my nephew
He was my brother’s son
Oh cousin cousin
Benvolio who started this fight
Romeo cried out “Stop my friends
Break it up” Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down
Before I could break up the fight Tybalt was killed
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead
Benvolio is part of the Montague family
He’s not telling the truth
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot and together those twenty could only kill one man
You Prince are the man who can give me justice
Romeo killed Tybalt
Romeo must die
Romeo killed Tybalt
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio’s life
His crime did justice’s job by taking Tybalt’s life
I’m involved in your rivalry
I’ll punish you so harshly that you’ll regret causing me this loss
I won’t listen to your pleas or excuses
You can’t get out of trouble by praying or crying so don’t bother
Take away this body and do what I say
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders
Or else love is blind and its best time is the night
I wish night would come like a widow dressed in black so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed
Come night
Come Romeo
You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up
Yes yes this is the rope ladder
Oh my what’s the news
Why do you look so upset
He’s dead
We’re ruined lady we’re ruined
What an awful day
Can God be so jealous and hateful
Romeo is hateful even though God isn’t
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this
This is as bad as the tortures of hell
Has Romeo killed himself
Just say “Yes” and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye
If he’s been killed say “Yes” If not say “No” These short words will determine my joy or my pain
I’ll send my eyes to prison and they’ll never be free to look at anything again
I’ll give my vile body back to the earth
Oh Tybalt Tybalt he was the best friend I had
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die
Has Romeo been killed and is Tybalt dead too
Tybalt was my dearest cousin
Tybalt is dead and Romeo has been banished
Oh God did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood
It did it did
Curse the day this happened but it did
Oh he’s like a snake disguised as a flower
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave
He’s a raven with the feathers of the dove
Oh nature what were you doing in hell
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover
Ah where’s my servant Give me some brandy These griefs these pains these sorrows make me old
Shame on Romeo
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that
He was not born to be shameful
He deserves only honor complete honor
Oh I was such a beast to be angry at him
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin
But why you villain did you kill my cousin
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband
All this is comforting news
Why then should I cry
I would be glad to forget about it but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds
Tybalt is dead and Romeo has been banished”
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts
Tybalt’s death would be bad enough if that was all
It would have been better if after she said “Tybalt’s dead” she told me my mother or my father or both were gone
But to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say “Romeo has been banished” To say that is like saying that my father my mother Tybalt Romeo and Juliet have all been killed they’re all dead
Romeo has been banished” That news brings infinite death
No words can express the pain
Where are my father and my mother Nurse
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt’s corpse
Are you going to join them
I’ll bring you there
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears
I’ll cry my tears for Romeo’s banishment when their tears are dry
Pick up this rope ladder
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed but I am a virgin and I will die a virgin and a widow
And death not Romeo can take my virginity
Go to your bedroom
I’ll find Romeo to comfort you
I know where he is
Listen your Romeo will be here tonight
I’ll go to him
He’s hiding out in Friar Lawrence’s cell
Romeo come out
Come out you frightened man
Father what’s the news
You know too much about suffering
I have news for you about the Prince’s punishment
Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than doomsday
Ha banishment
Be merciful and say “death” Exile is much worse than death
Don’t say “banishment” From now on you are banished from Verona
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona except purgatory torture and hell itself
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world and being banished from the world is death
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I’m being murdered
Oh deadly sin
Oh rude and unthankful boy
It’s torture not mercy
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo
Flies can kiss her but I must flee the city
Flies are like free men but I have been banished
And yet you say that exile is not death
Did you have no poison no sharp knife no weapon you could use to kill me quickly nothing so disgraceful except banishment
Oh Friar damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell
They howl about banishment
If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins and you say you’re my friend how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment
You foolish madman listen to me for a moment
Your servants were fighting your enemy’s servants before I got here
I drew my sword to part them
As we were trading blows more and more people showed up to join the fight until the Prince came and broke everyone up
Oh where’s Romeo
Have you seen him today
I’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight
I headed toward him but he saw me coming and hid in the woods
He’s been seen there many mornings crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs
But as soon as the sun rises in the east my sad son comes home to escape the light
Oh you’re just going to talk about banishment again
Don’t say anything else
Oh so madmen like you are also deaf
How should madmen hear if wise men can’t even see
Let me talk to you about your situation
You can’t talk about something that you don’t feel
If you were as young as I am if you were in love with Juliet if you had just married her an hour ago if then you murdered Tybalt if you were lovesick like me and if you were banished then you might talk about it
Get up
Somebody’s knocking
Hide yourself good Romeo
I won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people’s searching eyes
Why are you knocking so hard
Where do you come from
What do you want
Oh holy Friar Oh tell me holy Friar where is my lady’s husband
Where’s Romeo
Oh he’s acting just like Juliet just like her
Oh painful sympathy
She’s lying on the ground just like him blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
Stand up if you’re really a man
For Juliet’s sake for her sake rise and stand up
Why should you fall into so deep a moan
Nurse
Ah sir ah sir
Well death is the end for everybody
Were you talking about Juliet
How is she
Where is she
How is she doing
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love
She’s calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her just like I murdered her relative
Tell me Friar in what part of my body is my name embedded
Tell me so I can cut it out of myself
Are you a man
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast
You have amazed me
I swear by my holy order I thought you were smarter and more rational than this
Have you killed Tybalt
Why do you complain about your birth the heavens and the earth
You have so much natural talent but like someone who hoards money you use none of your talent for the right purpose not your body not your love not your mind
Get up man
Your Juliet is alive
Tybalt wanted to kill you but you killed Tybalt
Be happy that you’re alive
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy
But like a misbehaved sullen girl you’re whining about your bad luck and your love
Go be with your love as it was decided at your wedding
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her
Give my regards to your lady and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed
Romeo is coming
O Lord I could stay here all night listening to such good advice
Educated men are so impressive
Do so and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me
Here sir this is a ring she asked me to give you
Hurry up it’s getting late
This makes me feel so much better
Now get out of here
Good night
Everything depends on this either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions or leave in disguise after daybreak
Take a little vacation in Mantua
I’ll find your servant and he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands here
Give me your hand
It’s late
Farewell
Things have turned out so unluckily sir that we haven’t had time to convince our daughter to marry you
Listen she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly and so did I
Well we were all born to die
These times of pain are bad times for romance
Madam good night
Give my regards to your daughter
I will
Tonight she is shut up in her room alone with her sadness
Sir Paris I’ll make a desperate argument for my child’s love
Tell her about my son Paris’s love for her
And tell her listen to me on Wednesday Wait What day is today
Monday my lord
Monday
Ha ha
Do you think it’s a good idea to rush
We shouldn’t have too big a celebration we can invite a friend or two
Listen because Tybalt was just killed people might think that we don’t care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party
Therefore we’ll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding and that’s it
What do you think about Thursday
My lord I wish Thursday were tomorrow
Well go on home
Thursday it is then
Are you going
It’s still a long time until daybreak
That sound you heard was the  It was the lark the bird that sings at dawn not the nightingale
Look my love what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east
Night is over and day is coming
That light is not daylight I know it
It’s some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua
So stay for a while
You don’t have to go yet
Let me be captured
Let me be put to death
I am content if that’s the way you want it
I want to stay more than I want to go
Come death and welcome
Let’s talk
It’s not daylight
It is it is
It’s the lark that sings so out of tune making such harsh noise
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night
It’s not true because she separates us
More and more light
More and more pain for us
Madam
Nurse
Your mother is coming to your bedroom
Day has broken
Then the window lets day in and life goes out the window
Farewell farewell
Give me one kiss and I’ll go down
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight and makes himself an artificial night
My noble uncle do you know why he acts this way
I don’t know and he won’t tell me
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason
I hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around
Are you gone like that my love my lord
Oh by this count I’ll be many years older before I see my Romeo again
Farewell
I won’t miss any chance to send my love to you
Oh do you think we’ll ever meet again
Oh God I have a soul that predicts evil things
Now that you are down there you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb
Either my eyesight is failing me or you look pale
And trust me love you look pale to me too
Sadness takes away our color
Goodbye Goodbye
Oh luck luck
Everyone says you can’t make up your mind
I hope maybe then you’ll send him back home soon
Who’s that calling
Is it my mother
What strange reason could she have for coming here
What’s going on Juliet
Madam I am not well
Will you cry about your cousin’s death forever
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears
If you could you couldn’t bring him back to life
So stop crying
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss
You will feel the loss but the man you weep for will feel nothing
Feeling the loss like this I can’t help but weep for him forever
Well girl you’re weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive
What villain madam
That villain Romeo
That’s because the murderer is alive
Yes madam he lies beyond my reach
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin’s death except me
Stop crying
I’ll send a man to Mantua where that exiled rogue is living
And then I hope you’ll be satisfied
I’ll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him 
Madam if you can find a man to deliver the poison I’ll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him
Find out the way and I’ll find the right man
But now I have joyful news for you girl
And it’s good to have joy in such a joyless time
Please tell me
Well well you have a careful father child
Madam tell me quickly what day is that
Indeed my child at Saint Peter’s Church early Thursday morning the gallant young and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride
Now I swear by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too he will not make me a joyful bride there
How can I marry him this husband before he comes to court me
Please tell my father madam I won’t marry yet
And when I do marry I swear it will be Romeo whom you know I hate rather than Paris
That’s really news
Here comes your father
Tell him so yourself and see how he takes the news
What are you girl
Some kind of fountain
Why are you still crying
Have you told her our decision
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave
How can this be
Isn’t she proud of such a match
Doesn’t she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom
But I am thankful that you have found it
What is this
What is this fuzzy logic
What is this
I hear you say “proud” and “I thank you” and then “no thank you” and “not proud” you spoiled little girl
You disgust me you little bug
You worthless girl
You pale face
Shame on you
What are you crazy
Good father I’m begging you on my knees be patient and listen to me say just one thing
Don’t say anything
Don’t reply
Don’t talk back to me
She disgusts me the little hussy
God in heaven bless her
My lord you’re wrong to berate her like that
And why wise lady
Go blabber with your gossiping friends
I’ve said nothing wrong
Oh for God’s sake
Can’t I say something
Be quiet you mumbling fool
We don’t need to hear it
You’re getting too angry
Goddammit
It makes me mad
Day and night hour after hour all the time at work at play alone in company my top priority has always been to find her a husband
Thursday is coming
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice
If you act like my daughter I’ll marry you to my friend
Think about it
I won’t break this promise
Delay this marriage for a month or a week
Or if you don’t delay make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies
Don’t talk to me because I won’t say a word
Do as you please because I’m done worrying about you
Oh God Oh Nurse how can this be stopped
My husband is alive on earth my vows of marriage are in heaven
How can I bring those promises back down to earth unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven
Give me comfort
Don’t you have one word of joy
Give me some comfort Nurse
Oh he’s a lovely gentleman
Romeo’s a dishcloth compared to him
Madam an eagle does not have eyes as green as quick and as fair as the eyes of Paris
Curse my very heart but I think you should be happy in this second marriage because it’s better than your first
Even if it’s not better your first marriage is over
Are you speaking from your heart
Amen
What
Well you have given me great comfort
I made my father angry so I went to Friar Lawrence’s cell to confess and be forgiven
Alright I will
Oh that most wicked fiend
I’m going to the Friar to find out his solution
If everything else fails at least I have the power to take my own life
On Thursday sir
That’s very soon
You say you don’t know what the girl thinks
I don’t like it
Now you know the reason for the rush
Look sir here comes the lady walking toward my cell
I’m happy to meet you my lady and my wife
That might be the case sir
Good morning cousin
Is it that early in the day
It’s only just now nine o'clock
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry
It was
I don’t have the thing that makes time fly
You’re in love
Out
Out of love
So where should we eat
That “may be” must be love on Thursday
What must be will be
That is a certain truth
Have you come to make confession to this father
If I answered that question I’d be making confession to you
Don’t deny to him that you love me
I’ll confess to you that I love him
You will also confess I’m sure that you love me
If I do so it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face
You poor soul your face has suffered many tears
Your face is mine and you have slandered it
I have time for you now my sad daughter
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion
Oh Juliet I already know about your sad situation
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday and that nothing can delay it
Don’t tell me that you’ve heard about this marriage Friar unless you can tell me how to prevent it
If you who are so wise can’t help please be kind enough to call my solution wise
Hold on then
Tomorrow is Wednesday
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone
Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom
Give me the vial
Give it to me
Love will give me strength and strength will help me accomplish this plan
Goodbye dear Father
You won’t get any bad cooks from me
How can you test them like that
So the cooks who can’t lick their fingers aren’t hired
Go get out of here
We’re unprepared for this wedding celebration
Yes that’s true
Look she’s come home from confession with a happy look on her face
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness
Send for the Count
Go tell him about this
I’ll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning
I met the young man at Lawrence’s cell
Well I’m glad about this
This is good
Stand up
Yes alright go I say and bring him here
Now before God our whole city owes this friar a great debt
Nurse will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I’ll need to wear tomorrow
No not until Thursday
There’s plenty of time
We’ll have the wedding at the church tomorrow
It’s already almost night
And everything will be alright I promise you wife
You should go to Juliet and dress her up
I’m not going to bed tonight
Leave me alone
I’ll pretend to be the housewife for once
Yes those are the best clothes
What are you busy
Do you need my help
I’m sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities
Good night
Only God knows when we’ll meet again
In my desperate situation I have to act alone
Alright here’s the vial
What if this mixture doesn’t work at all
Will I be married tomorrow morning
Lie down right there
Oh look
I think I see my cousin Tybalt’s ghost
Wait Tybalt wait
Romeo Romeo Romeo
Here’s a drink
I drink to you
No cousin I’m crying
Good man why are you crying
Yes this is what love does
What else is love
It’s a sweet lozenge that you choke on
Goodbye cousin
Wait
I’ll come with you
If you leave me like this you’re doing me wrong
I’m not myself
I’m not here
Tell me seriously who is the one you love
You mean I should groan and tell you
Groan
No
But tell me seriously who it is
Take these keys and get more spices Nurse
They’re calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen
Come on wake up wake up wake up
The second cock crowed
The curfew bell rang
Don’t worry about the cost
Go you old housewife go
Go to bed dear
You’ll be sick tomorrow because you’ve stayed up all night
I’ve stayed up all night many times before for less important matters and I’ve never gotten sick
Yes you’ve been a ladies' man in your time
A jealous woman a jealous woman
Now fellow what have you got there
Hurry up hurry up
I’m smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter
Right and well said
That guy’s funny
Goodness it’s daylight
Wife
What
Hey Nurse
Go wake Juliet
Go and get her dressed
I’ll go and chat with Paris
Hey hurry up hurry up
The bridegroom is already here
Hurry up I say
Mistress
Hey mistress
I bet she’s fast asleep
Hey lady
Hey love I say
Madam
Sweetheart
Hey bride
What you don’t say a word
You take your beauty sleep now
How sound asleep she is
Yes let the count take you in your bed
He’ll wake you up I bet
Won’t he
What’s all the noise in here
Oh sad day
What is the matter
Look look
Oh what a sad day
Oh my Oh my
My child my reason for living wake up look up or I’ll die with you
For shame bring Juliet out here
Her bridegroom is here
She’s dead deceased she’s dead
Curse the day
Curse the day
She’s dead she’s dead she’s dead
No
Let me see her
Oh no
She’s cold
Her blood has stopped and her joints are stiff
She’s been dead for some time
She’s dead like a beautiful flower killed by an unseasonable frost
Oh sad day
Oh this is a painful time
Death which has taken her away to make me cry now ties up my tongue and won’t let me speak
Come is the bride ready to go to church
She’s ready to go but she’ll never return
Death is my son in law
Death is my heir
My daughter married death
I will die and leave Death everything
Life wealth everything belongs to Death
Have I waited so long to see this morning only to see this
Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day
This is the most miserable hour of all time
I had only one child one poor child one poor and loving child the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself and cruel Death has stolen it from me
Oh pain
Oh painful painful painful day
There has never been so black a day as today
Oh painful day Oh painful day
She was tricked divorced wronged spited killed
Cruel cruel Death killed her
Oh love
Oh life
There is no life but my love is dead
Despised distressed hated martyred killed
Why did this have to happen now
My soul and not my child
You are dead
Be quiet for shame
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming
You had this child with the help of heaven
Now heaven has her
She is in a better place
You could not prevent her from dying someday but heaven will give her eternal life
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder that was your idea of heaven
And now you cry even though she has risen up above the clouds as high as heaven itself
Oh in this love you love your child so badly that you go mad even though she is in heaven
It is best to marry well and die young better than to be married for a long time
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave
Don’t disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven’s will
Well we can put away our pipes and go home
Yes well things could get better
No not a sad song
It’s not the right time to play
You won’t then
No
Then I’ll really give it to you
What will you give us
No money I swear
I’ll call you a minstrel
Then I’ll call you a serving creature
Then I’ll smack you on the head with the serving creature’s knife
I’ll make you sing
Do you hear me
Answer me like men
Well sir because silver has a sweet sound
Another studpid answer
What do you say James  Well I don’t know what to say
I’ll answer for you
It is “music with her silver sound” because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds
What an annoying man this guy is
Forget about him Jack
If I can trust my dreams then some joyful news is coming soon
Oh my
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love when merely thinking about love makes me so happy
Do you have news from Verona What is it Balthasar
Do you bring me a letter from the friar
How is my wife
Is my father well
How is my Juliet
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well
Then she is well and nothing is wrong
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven
I saw her buried in her family’s tomb and then I came here to tell you the news
Oh pardon me for bringing this bad news but you told me it was my job sir
You wouldn’t tell a sick man he “seriously” has to make his will it would just make him worse
Seriously cousin I love a woman
Then you were right on target
The woman I love is beautiful
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest
Well you’re not on target there
Yes she has and by keeping celibate she wastes her beauty
She’s too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven’s blessing by making me despair
Take my advice
Don’t think about her
Teach me to forget to think
Is it really true
Then I rebel against you stars
You know where I live
Get me some ink and paper and hire some horses to ride
I will leave here for Verona tonight
Please sir have patience
You look pale and wild as if you’re going to hurt yourself
Tsk you’re wrong
Leave me and do what I told you to do
Don’t you have a letter for me from the friar
No my good lord
No matter
Get on your way and hire those horses
I’ll be with you right away
Well Juliet I’ll lie with you tonight
Let’s see how
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men
As I remember this should be the house
Today’s a holiday so the beggar’s shop is shut
Hey
Pharmacist
Who’s that calling so loud
Come here man
I see that you are poor
Here are forty ducats
You’re this poor and wretched and still afraid to die
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger
I can see in your eyes that you’re starving
The world is not your friend and neither is the law
The world doesn’t make laws to make you rich
I pay you because you’re poor not because you want me to buy this
Holy Franciscan Friar
Brother hey
That sounds like the voice of Friar John
Welcome back from Mantua
What does Romeo say
Or if he wrote down his thoughts give me his letter
I couldn’t go to Mantua because I was stuck there
Then who took my letter to Romeo
Unhappy fortune
Brother I’ll go and bring it to you
Now I must go to the tomb alone
Within three hours Juliet will wake up
But I’ll write again to Mantua and I’ll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes
She’s shut inside a dead man’s tomb
Give me your torch boy
Go away and stay apart from me
Put the torch out so I can’t be seen
Give me those flowers
Do as I tell you
Go
The boy is warning me that someone approaches
Who’s ruining my rituals of true love
It’s someone with a torch
I must hide in the darkness for awhile
Give me that pickax and the crowbar
I’ll go sir and I won’t bother you
That’s the way to show me friendship
Take this
Good and noble young man don’t mess with someone who’s desperate
Get away from here and leave me
Think about the ones who have died
Let them put fear in your heart
Please young man don’t make me angry
Oh go away
Don’t stay here go away
Live and from now on say a madman mercifully told you to run away
I’m arresting you as a criminal
Are you going to provoke me
Alright let’s fight boy
Oh Lord they’re fighting
I’ll go call the watch
Alright I will
It’s Mercutio’s relative noble Count Paris
What did my man say
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet
Isn’t that what he said
Or was I dreaming
I’ll bury you in a magnificent grave
A grave
Oh no
Juliet lies here and her beauty fills this tomb with light
Death has sucked the honey from your breath but it has not yet ruined your beauty
You haven’t been conquered
Oh what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young
Should I believe that death is in love with you and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress
Here here I’ll remain with worms that are your chamber maids
Oh I’ll rest here forever
Eyes look out for the last time
Arms make your last embrace
His drugs work quickly
So I die with a kiss
Look at other beautiful girls
Saint Francis help me
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones
I’m a friend a friend who knows you well
God bless you
Tell me my good friend what is that light over there
It looks to me like it’s burning in the Capulet tomb
Who is it
Romeo
How long has he been there
For a full half hour
Go with me to the tomb
I don’t dare sir
Stay then
I’ll go alone
I’m suddenly afraid
Oh I’m very scared something awful has happened
As I slept under this yew tree here I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb
Oh friendly friar
Where is my husband
I remember very well where I should be and here I am
Where is my Romeo
I hear some noise
Lady come out of the tomb
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan
Come come away
Your husband lies dead there and Paris too
Come I’ll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns
It’s a cup closed in my true love’s hand
Poison I see has been the cause of his death
I will kiss your lips
Perhaps there’s still some poison on them to make me die with a medicinal kiss
Oh noise
Then I’ll be quick
Oh good a knife
Rust inside my body and let me die
This is the place
There where the torch is burning
The ground is bloody
This is a pitiful sight
Go tell the Prince
Run to the Capulets
Wake up the Montagues
Have some others search
Here’s Romeo’s man
We found him in the churchyard
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here
Here is a friar who’s trembling sighing and weeping
We took this pickax and this shovel from him as he was walking from this side of the graveyard
Very suspicious
Hold the friar too
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time
What’s the problem that they cry out so loud
Some people in the street are crying “Romeo” Some are crying “Juliet” and some are crying “Paris” They’re all running in an open riot toward our tomb
Investigate how this foul murder came about
Oh heavens
Oh wife look at how our daughter bleeds
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague’s back but instead it’s mis sheathed in my daughter’s breast
Oh my
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I’m old and I’ll die soon
Oh my liege my wife died tonight
Sadness over my son’s exile stopped her breath
What further pain must I endure in my old age
Look and you’ll see
And then I’ll be the leader of pain and maybe I’ll lead you as far as death
In the meantime hold on and be patient
I am the greatest but I was able to do the least
I have already condemned and excused myself
Tell us what you know about this affair
I will be brief because I’m not going to live long enough to tell a boring story
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off
I know all of this
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death
Give me the letter
Oh brother Montague give me your hand
But what do you say to my request
I can only repeat what I’ve said before
My daughter is still very young
She’s not even fourteen years old
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon
But go ahead and charm her gentle Paris make her love you
Tonight I’m having a feast that we’ve celebrated for many years
At my humble house tonight you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below
In the beautiful city of Verona where our story takes place a long standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud
Come along with me
Find the people whose names are on this list
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others' tools that fisherman should play with paints and painters should play with with fishing nets
But I’ve been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list and I can’t read
But here come some people right in the nick of time
For when you cut your shin
What
Romeo are you crazy
I’m locked up in a prison and deprived of food
I’m whipped and tortured  May God give you a good evening
Excuse me sir do you know how to read
I can read my own fortune in my misery
Perhaps you’ve learned from life and not from books
But please tell me can you read anything you see
Yes if I know the language and the letters
I see
Well that’s an  Stay fellow
I can read
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters Vitruvio’s widow Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces Mercutio and his brother Valentine My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters My fair niece Rosaline and Livia
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt Lucio and the lively Helena” That’s a nice group of people
Where are they supposed to come
Up
Where
To supper
To our house
Whose house
My master’s house
Indeed I should have asked you before who he was
Now I’ll tell you so you don’t have to ask
My master is the great and rich Capulet and if you don’t belong to the house of Montague please come and drink a cup of wine
Have a nice day
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet’s traditional feast along with every beautiful woman in Verona
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I’ll show you
A woman more beautiful than the one I love
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began
I’ll go with you
Nurse where’s my daughter
Tell her to come to me
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve I already told her to come
Come on
Who’s calling me
Your mother
Madam I’m here
What do you want
You know how young my daughter is
Yes I know her age down to the hour
She’s not even fourteen
I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth but I’m sorry to say I only have four teeth she’s not fourteen
Whether it’s even or odd of all the days in the year on the night of Lammas Eve she’ll be fourteen
She and Susan God rest her and all Christian souls were born on the same day
Well Susan died and is with God
She was too good for me
But like I said on the night of Lammas Eve she will be fourteen
Yes she will
Indeed I remember it well
It’s been eleven years since the earthquake
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun under the wall of the dovehouse
But like I said when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake
There was no need to tell me to get out of there
Oh” he said “Did you fall on your face
You’ll  Enough of this
Please be quiet
Yes madam
But I can’t help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said “Yes” I swear she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster’s testicle
It was a painful bruise and she was crying bitterly
Yes” said my husband “Did you fall on your face
You’ll fall backward when you grow up won’t you Jule” And she stopped crying and said “Yes” Now you stop too Nurse please
May God choose you to receive his grace
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed
If I live to see you get married someday all my wishes will come true
Tell me my daughter Juliet what is your attitude about getting married
It is an honor that I do not dream of
Well start thinking about marriage now
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you girls from noble families who have already become mothers
By my count I was already your mother at just about your age while you remain a virgin
Well then I’ll say this quickly the valiant Paris wants you as his bride
What a man young lady
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him
Lose nothing
I’ll look at him and try to like him at least if what I see is likable
But I won’t let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows
Everything’s out of control
Please follow straight after me
We’ll follow you
Go girl look for a man who’ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days
What will we say is our excuse for being here
Or should we enter without apologizing
It’s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that
Let them judge us however they please
Give me a torch
I don’t want to dance
No noble Romeo you’ve got to dance
Not me believe me
You’re wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles
My soul is made out of lead and it’s so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can’t move
You’re a lover
Take Cupid’s wings and fly higher than the average man
His arrow has pierced me too deeply so I can’t fly high with his cheerful feathers
I sink under the heavy weight of love
We won’t take their garbage
I hit hard when I’m angry
Angry enough to run away
You won’t stand and fight
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand
If you sink you’re dragging love down
Is love really tender
I think it’s too rough too rude too rowdy and it pricks like a thorn
If love plays rough with you play rough with  Come on let’s knock and go in
Let playful people with light hearts dance
Come on we’re wasting precious daylight
Let’s go
No we’re not it’s night
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball but it’s not smart of us to go
Why may I ask
I had a dream last night
So did I
Well what was your dream
My dream told me that dreamers often lie
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth
Oh then I see you’ve been with  Who’s Queen Mab
Sometimes she rides over a courtier’s lips and he dreams of making money off of someone
Sometimes she tickles a priest’s nose with a  Enough enough
Mercutio be quiet
The wind you’re talking about is blowing us off our course
Dinner is over and we’re going to get there too late
Onward lover boys
Beat the drum
Where’s Potpan
When only one or two men have all the good manners and even they are dirty things are bad
Take away the stools the sideboards and the plates
You good friend save me a piece of marzipan and if you love me have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell
Yes boy I’m ready
They’re looking for you in the great chamber
We can’t be in two places at once both here and there
Cheers boys
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything
Welcome gentlemen
Whichever of you acts shy I’ll swear she has corns
Welcome gentlemen
I swear it must be thirty years
It’s been longer it’s been longer
Lucentio’s son is older than that sir
He’s thirty years old
Are you really going to tell me that
His son was a minor only two years ago
I don’t know sir
Oh she shows the torches how to burn bright
My eyes were liars then because I never saw true beauty before tonight
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague
Why are you acting so angry
Uncle this man is a Montague our enemy
Is it young Romeo
That’s him that villain Romeo
Calm down gentle cousin
Leave him alone
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman and to tell you the truth he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well behaved young man
I wouldn’t insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town
So calm down
Just ignore him
I won’t tolerate him
You  But uncle we’re being disrespected
Go on go on
You’re an insolent little boy
Is that how it is really
I know what I’ll do
You have to contradict me do you
I’ll teach you a lesson
Don’t saints and pilgrims have lips too
Yes pilgrim they have lips that they’re supposed to pray with
Well then saint let lips do what hands do
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair
Saints don’t move even when they grant prayers
Then don’t move while I act out my prayer
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours
Sin from my lips
Give me my sin back
You kiss like you’ve studied how
Madam your mother wants to talk to you
Who is her mother
I nursed her daughter whom you were just talking to
Let me tell you the man who marries her will become very wealthy
No gentlemen don’t get ready to go now
We have a little dessert coming up
You’re right
The fight is between our masters and we men who work for them
It’s all the same
I’ll be a harsh master to them
Cut off their heads
You mean their  Cut off their heads take their maidenheads whatever
Take my remark in whichever sense you like
The women you rape are the ones who’ll have to “sense” it
Everybody knows I’m a nice piece of flesh
It’s a good thing you’re not a piece of fish
You’re    Pull out your tool now
I have my naked sword out
Come over here nurse
Who is that gentleman
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio
Who’s the one who’s going out the door right now
Well that one I think is young Petruchio
I don’t know his name
Go ask
What’s this
What’s this
The strangers are all gone
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy
And Juliet’s just as much in love as he but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover
But love gives them power and time gives them the chance to meet sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure
Can I go away while my heart stays here
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall
Call to him Mercutio
I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit
Romeo
Show yourself in the form of a sigh
Speak one rhyme and I’ll be satisfied
Just cry out “Ah me” Just say “love” and “dove” Say just one lovely word to my good friend
If he hears you you’ll make him angry
What I’m saying can’t anger him
The things I’m saying are fair and honest
His love is blind so it belongs in the dark
If love is blind it can’t hit the target
Now he’ll sit under a  Let’s go
There’s no point in looking for him if he doesn’t want to be found
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Virginity makes her look sick and green
Let it go
Oh there’s my lady
Oh it is my love
Oh I wish she knew how much I love her
She’s talking but she’s not saying anything
So what
Her eyes are saying something
She’s not talking to me
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return
If her eyes were in the night sky they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing thinking her light was the light of day
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek
Oh I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek
Oh my
Who are you
I hate my name dear saint because my name is your enemy
Aren’t you Romeo
And aren’t you a Montague
Tell me how did you get in here
And why did you come
If any of my relatives find you here they’ll kill you because of who you are
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle
If they see you they’ll murder you
Just look at me kindly and I’m invincible against their hatred
I’d give anything to keep them from seeing you here
I’d rather they killed me than have to live without your love
Otherwise you’d see me blushing about the things you’ve heard me say tonight
Do you love me
I know you’ll say “yes” and I’ll believe you
What should I swear by
Don’t swear at all
But if you have to swear swear by your wonderful self which is the god I worship like an idol and then I’ll believe you
If my heart’s dear love  Well don’t swear
Although you bring me joy I can’t take joy in this exchange of promises tonight
Our love which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart
Oh are you going to leave me so unsatisfied
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to
Yet I wish I could take that promise back so I had it to give again
You would take it back
Why would you do that my love
Only to be generous and give it to you once more
But I’m wishing for something I already have
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea and my love is as deep
I hear a noise inside
Sweet Montague be true
Stay here for a moment
I’ll come back
Oh blessed blessed night
Because it’s dark out I’m afraid all this is just a dream too sweet to be real
Three words dear Romeo and then it’s good night for real
Don’t worry about me
I  Let’s not break the law by starting a fight
Let them start something
I’ll frown at them as they pass by and they can react however they want
You mean however they dare
I’ll bite my thumb at them
Hey are you biting your thumb at us
I’m biting my thumb
Are you biting your thumb at us
Are you trying to start a fight
Start a fight
No sir
Tomorrow I’ll send the messenger
My soul depends on it  A thousand times good night
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you
Oh I wish I could make a  My soul is calling out my name
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver sweet
Romeo
My baby hawk
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you
By nine o'clock
I won’t fail
From now until then seems like twenty years
I have forgotten why I called you back
Let me stand here until you remember your reason
I’ll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here
It’s almost morning
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string
I wish I was your bird
My sweet so do I
But I would kill you by petting you too much
Good night good night
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I’ll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow
I hope you sleep peacefully
I wish I were Sleep and Peace so I could spend the night with you
Now I’ll go see my priest to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man
Now before the sun comes up and burns away the dew I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers
The Earth is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb
From the Earth’s womb many different sorts of plants and animals come forth and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment
Herbs plants and stones possess great power
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality
Virtue turns to vice if it’s misused
Inside the little rind of this weak flower there is both poison and powerful medicine
There are two opposite elements in everything in men as well as in herbs good and evil
When evil is dominant death soon kills the body like cancer
Good morning father
God bless you
Who greets me so early in the morning
Young man something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early
Every old man has worries and worried men never get any sleep but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep
Therefore the fact that you’re awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with some anxiety
If that’s not the case then this must be the answer You Romeo have not been to bed tonight
Your last guess is right
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep
With Rosaline father
That’s good my boy
But where have you been
I’ll tell you before you have to ask me again
You have the sacred power to cure both of us
I carry no hatred holy man because my request will benefit my enemy
Here comes your father
Don’t even think about refusing
I must and will have Katherine for my wife
Now Signior Petruchio how are you getting on with my daughter
Beautifully sir beautifully
Now daughter Katherine
Are you down in the dumps
You have the nerve to call me daughter
Sir this is the truth you and the rest all the people who have ever talked about her have all been wrong
She has the patience of a  I’ll see you hanged on Sunday first
Listen to that Petruchio she says she’ll see you hanged first
Is this your idea of success
So much for our plan
Relax gentlemen
I’ve made my choice
If she and I are happy what’s it to you
When we were alone we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant
I tell you though it’s incredible how much she loves me
Darling Kate
You men are rank beginners
Give me your hand Kate
I’m off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding
God give you joy Petruchio
Call it a match
Amen to that
We’ll be your witnesses
Father wife friends farewell
I’m off to Venice
Sunday is just around the corner
We’re to be married on Sunday
Was there ever a match put together so quickly
I’ve made a risky investment
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match
There’s no doubt that Petruchio’s got quite a catch
Now Baptista let’s turn to your younger daughter
We’ve been waiting a long time for this day
I’m your neighbor and came courting first
Callow youth you don’t yet know how to love
And you’re all sizzle
Stand back boy
Age is the thing that nourishes
Enough gentlemen
I will settle this matter
First of all my house in the city as you know is filled with expensive furniture and household articles china and gold basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in
Then at my farm I have a hundred milk cows a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables and all the equipment necessary to maintain them
Two thousand ducats a year from his land
I can’t offer her more than all I have
I must admit your offer is the best
Otherwise forgive me but if you should die before him what becomes of her dowry
Oh and young men never die
As you know next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married
I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto
Yes that was it
You gave an excellent performance
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight
Go lad and take them to the pantry
Farewell good neighbor
Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house
It’s absurd
An old Italian fox is never that generous my boy
Sneaky dried up old coot
Usually fathers produce children not the other way around
But in this case of wooing a child shall father his own father if my wits don’t fail me
I’ll have my lessons in the order and manner
Where did we leave off
Here madam     Translate
Now let me see if I can translate it
There’s no need to be really for   You’re my teacher so I must believe you
But let it go Now Litio it’s your turn
I hope sir that you’re not angry that I’ve been equally attentive to you both
You call this a scale
I don’t like it
I like doing things the old fashioned way
Mistress your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister’s room
You know tomorrow is her wedding day
Farewell to both of you dear teachers
I have to go
But there’s reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster
He acts like a man in love
The humiliation is all mine
So now everyone will point at me and say “Look there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing”
Maybe but I wish I’d never laid eyes on him
Go daughter
I cannot blame you now for weeping
Master master
I have news old news such as you never heard before
You say you have news that’s old
How can that be
Well is it not news that Petruchio’s coming
Is he here
Why no sir
What then
He is coming
When will he be here
When he stands where I am and sees you there
Who comes with him
He’s dressed like a freak a total freak and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman’s valet
I am glad he’s coming however he’s dressed
Why sir he’s not coming
Didn’t you just say he was
Who
Petruchio
Yes Petruchio
No I said his horse is coming with him on its back
Well that’s the same thing
No by Saint Jamy I’ll bet you a penny
You are welcome sir
I’ll give you more instructions later
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures
I can’t wait to hear him call the drunkard “husband” and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant
I’ll go and coach them
Where is my lovely bride
Why sir you know this is your wedding day
It’s a long story and tough to listen to
But where is Kate
We’re wasting time here
Don’t greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes
Go to my room and put on something of mine
Not me
I’ll see her like this
But surely you’re not planning to
Yes just like this
Though I expect she’ll wear me out more quickly than I’ll wear out what I’m wearing which will be good for her and even better for me
But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason
I’ll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church if it’s at all possible
I’ll go too and make sure that happens
And
We’ll outwit them all that old geezer Gremio the suspicious father Minola the prim musician lover Litio all for the sake of my master Lucentio
Signior Gremio are you coming from the church
As eagerly as I ever came from school
Bridegroom
No he’s a devil a devil I tell you
Why she’s a lamb a dove a child compared to him
She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him
Finally the ceremony done he called for wine
Next he slung his arm around the bride’s neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo
That was the limit for me
It’s disgraceful
There go the minstrels
You’re not thinking of leaving tonight surely
Not tonight today
If you knew the reason you’d understand and would urge me to go rather than stay
Good friends I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient sweet virtuous wife
Goodbye to you all
Can’t do it
As a favor to  Nope
As a favor to  I’m delighted
Delighted to stay
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely but I won’t stay in any case
Look if you love me stay
Grumio get me my horse
Yes sir they’re ready
They’ve eaten themselves sick
The door is open sir
Go on wear your boots out
As for me I’ll leave when I like
Calm down Kate
Please don’t be angry
I will be angry
What business is it of yours Father be quiet
He’ll stay as long as I say
Okay now it starts
Gentlemen on to the bridal dinner
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn’t have nerve enough to stand up for herself
They
No let them go
They’re certainly a peaceful couple
That since she’s mad herself she’s married a madman
Neighbors and friends though we don’t have anyone for the bride and bridegroom’s places at the table you know there’s nothing missing in the feast itself
She shall Lucentio
Come gentlemen let’s go in
To hell with all worn out horses all crazy masters and all bad roads
Was a man ever beaten as much as me
Was a man ever as dirty as me
Was a man ever so tired
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire and they are coming after to warm themselves
It’s a good thing I’m like a little pot and warm up quickly or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth my tongue to the roof of my mouth and my heart would freeze in my belly before I managed to get thawed out
I’ll warm myself by blowing on the fire
Who calls so coldly
A piece of ice
Trust me you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck
Start the fire good Curtis
Are my master and his wife coming Grumio
Yes yes Curtis so hurry up and start the fire
Leave out the water
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say
Well she was good Curtis before this frost
Your horn is a foot long and I’m at least that size
So tell me Grumio how goes the world
Therefore do your duty and take your reward because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death
The fire is ready
So go on tell me the news
I think I’m getting delirious
Where’s the cook
Is supper ready
Are all the cups and glasses in their places the tablecloths laid out everything in order
For God’s sake would someone bring me a mug of beer
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit
What garment would your Honor like to wear today
I’m Christopher Sly
Everything’s ready
So tell me what’s been going on
Well first of all my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out
How
From their saddles into the dirt but that’s another story
Well let’s have it Grumio
Lean forward
Here
There
This is to feel the news not hear it
That’s what makes it “sensitive” news
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home
Now I’ll begin first we came down a steep hill my master riding behind my mistress  Both on one horse
What’s the difference
Well the difference of a horse
It’s too bad
Yes as you and the rest will find out as soon as he’s home
But why am I telling you this
Get them in here Nathaniel Joseph Nicholas Philip Walter Sugarsop and the rest
Tell them to slick down their hair brush their blue coats and make sure their socks match
Have them click their heels together and don’t dare touch a hair of the master’s horse’s tail till they kiss their hands
Are they all ready
They are
Get them in here
She already has a face
Yeah so
You just said they had to face her
I meant they had to give her credit
She’s not going to borrow money from them
Welcome home Grumio
What’s up Grumio
Hey Grumio
My man Grumio
So what’s the story old boy
Any minute
Where are those bastards
Here here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir
Here sir” You stupid unpolished dolts
Where is the fool I sent on ahead
Here sir as foolish as ever
You unwashed farmworker
You bastard workhorse drudge
Didn’t I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you
Nathaniel’s coat was being fixed sir
And Walter couldn’t get his dagger out of its sheath
Only Adam Rafe and Gregory were ready
Go blockheads go and bring my supper to me
Where are my slippers
Can we have some water please here  Come and wash Kate make yourself at home
Take it easy
Please
It was just an accident
Will you say grace sweet Kate or shall I What is this
Mutton
Yes
Who brought it out here
I did
You bastards
Where is that moron of a cook
How dare you serve it to me this way
There take it all back plates cups the whole thing
Please dear calm down
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it
And I’m telling you it was burnt and dried out
Come I’ll show you your bridal chamber
Peter did you ever see anything like it
He’s giving her a taste of her own medicine
Where is he
Look out he’s coming
Well I’ve begun my reign with a carefully thought out plan and I have every hope of succeeding
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me for if her hunger is satisfied she’ll pay no attention to the bait
I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner’s call is to keep her from sleeping 
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey
She had no food today and will have none
Last night she got no sleep and she won’t get any tonight
Just as I did with the meat I’ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other and the blanket over here and the sheets over there
And if she starts to drop off I’ll rant and yell until I wake her up
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew speak up please
It would be much appreciated
What are you reading teacher
Answer me that first
I hope you’re an expert in your field
Let me come clean
I’m not really Litio
My name is Hortensio sir
Look how they kiss and carry on
The hell with her
Look how she carries on with him
It’s revolting
Well to be on the safe side so I don’t go back on my promise I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days
Farewell then Signior Lucentio
From now on goodness in women not superficial beauty will win my heart
What are you trying to make me crazy
I’m Christopher Sly son of old Sly of Barton on Heath a peddler by birth a  Oh this is why your poor wife is mourning
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow
Oh noble lord consider your lineage
Look how your servants wait on you each one ready to do whatever you command
Would you care to hear some music
Listen
Do you want to sleep
We’ll have a couch made up that’s softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful
You’re busted
Hortensio and I have given you up
You can’t mean it Tranio
Have you both really given me up
Yes ma'am we have
So Litio’s out of the picture
He’s going after a young widow
Well good for him
Yeah and he’s going to tame her
Is that what he says
The taming school
Is there such a place
Master master I’ve been on the lookout so long I’m ready to fall down dead but I’ve got one finally
What does he look like Biondello
And what about him Tranio
Go take your sweetheart and leave him to me
May God keep you well sir
This is it for now
Mantua
Killed
Why
That would be a little extreme
It’s a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua
Didn’t you know
It’s strange that you haven’t heard
I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver
Oh yes sir I have often been to Pisa Pisa City of Wise Men
Oh sir I accept
And I’ll be eternally grateful to you
No no I can’t really
The more I suffer the more spiteful he becomes
Did he marry me just to starve me
And if they don’t find charity there they find it someplace else
But I who have never known how to beg and never had to beg am starved for food dizzy with lack of sleep kept awake with curses and fed with brawling
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death
What do you say to a calf’s foot
Oh lovely
Can I have some
I’m afraid it will  I’d love it
Nice Grumio bring me some
I don’t know
I’m afraid it will make you too hot too
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard
Yes but the mustard is probably too hot
Well then the beef without the mustard
Absolutely not
You’ll take the mustard or you’ll get no beef from Grumio
Then both or one or anything you like
How about the mustard without the beef
Get out of here you measly lying wretch
Cheer up
Give us a smile
Look love see how devoted I am
I am sure sweet Kate this kindness deserves thanks
What not a word
I guess you don’t want it
Here take away the dish
Please leave it here
Thank you sir
Come mistress Kate I’ll join you
Now tailor let’s see what you’ve got
Lay out the gown
What can I do for you sir
Here is the cap your Worship ordered
Why this was modeled on a porridge bowl
No definitely not
It’s cheap and nasty
It’s like a cockleshell or a walnut shell a joke a prank a doll’s cap
Take it away
Bring me a bigger one
I won’t have one any bigger
When you are gentle you shall have one too and not till then
Sir I think I have the right to speak and speak I certainly will
I am not a child or an infant
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind and if you can’t take it then you’d better plug your ears
You know you’re right
It’s a measly little cap a dessert crust a plaything a silk pie
I love you all the more for not liking it
I don’t care if you love me or not I like the cap and I’ll have it or I won’t have any
Now your gown
Yes yes
Come tailor show it to us
Merciful God
What do you call this
A sleeve
It’s like a cannon
Carved it up and down like an apple tart
Snip and snip and cut and slash it’s got more holes than a sieve
What in the world do you call this tailor
You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style
Certainly I did
But if you remember I didn’t tell you to parody the style
I won’t take it
Do whatever you want with it
I never saw a better designed gown more elegant and pleasing and well made
Yes that’s it
It’s a lie you thread you thimble you measurement
You flea you louse you winter cricket
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread
I tell you you’ve ruined her gown
It’s not true
The gown was made just as my master was directed
Grumio gave the order for how it should be done
I gave him no order
I gave him the material
But how did you want it made
With a needle and thread
But didn’t you expect us to cut the cloth
Well don’t face off with me
You have bested many things well don’t try and best me
I will not be faced or bested
I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown but I didn’t ask him to cut it all to pieces
Why here is the order to prove it
Read it
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so
Do you like pictures
You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face she was the fairest creature in the world and even now she has no equal
I admit the cape
I admit two sleeves
Ah there’s the problem
Error in the bill sir error in the bill
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again and I’ll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble
I am ready for you
You take the bill and I’ll take your yardstick
God have mercy Grumio
He won’t have a chance
Well sir the gown is not for me
You are right it’s for my mistress
Go take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can
Certainly not
Take off my mistress' gown for your master’s use
Why what’s the problem
Oh sir the problem goes far deeper than you realize
Take up my mistress' gown for his master’s use
Oh that’s disgusting
Ah well my Kate
I mean is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye
Hardly Kate
If you regard it as shameful put the shame on me
We’re off to eat and whoop it up at your father’s house
I hate to say it but it’s almost two and we won’t get there before suppertime
It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse
Whatever I say or think or do you’re continually contradicting it
Sirs never mind
We won’t go today or any day until it’s clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is
Yes certainly
Unless I am mistaken Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa where we both stayed twenty years ago
Of course I will
But sir here comes your servant
Don’t worry about me
I told him that your father was in Venice and that you expected him to arrive in Padua today
He gives BIONDELLO  Here comes Baptista
Places everyone
Signior Baptista I’m glad to see you Sir this is the gentleman I told you of
I hope you’ll be a good father to me now
Give me Bianca for my inheritance
Sir pardon me for what I am about to say
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity
It’s true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter and she loves him or else they’re putting on quite an act
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter
Not in my house Lucentio
My servants might overhear and old Gremio is still hanging around so we might be interrupted
I hope with all my heart she will
Cambio
What is it Biondello
You saw my master wink and laugh at you
What about it
Please educate me
He’s talking with the bogus father about the bogus son
And so 
You are to bring his daughter to the supper
And then
The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command at all hours
And what of all this
I don’t know except they are busy with some phony guarantee
So go and put your stamp on the girl
Go to the church take the priest the clerk and some reasonably honest witnesses
If this isn’t what you’ve been hoping for I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit
Farewell sir
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Luke’s to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half
She will be pleased
Then why am I worried
It will be hard if “Cambio” loses her
Come let’s continue on toward your father’s house
Good Lord how bright and splendid is the moon tonight
The moon
You mean the sun
It is not nighttime now
I say it’s the moon that shines so bright
I know it’s the sun that shines so bright
Now by my mother’s son and that’s me it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I’ll travel to your father’s house
I say it’s the moon
I know it’s the moon
Well you’re a liar then
It’s the blessed sun
Then God be praised it  Petruchio do whatever you like
You’ve won
Well onward then
That’s how things should be straight and smooth
But hang on
I hear someone coming
Young budding virgin fair and pure and sweet where are you off to
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child
Is  Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands
We’re overjoyed to see you sane again
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are
These past fifteen years you have been living in a dream and even when you were awake it was as though you slept
Fifteen years
That’s some nap
But I never spoke the whole time
Oh yes you spoke my lord but total nonsense
But sir there is no such house no such maid and no such men as you have dreamed up like a certain Stephen Sly and one old John Naps of Greece a Peter Turph one “Henry Pimpernell” and twenty more men of this sort who never actually existed
Why dear me Kate
I hope you haven’t lost your mind
This is not a maiden as you say but an old man wrinkled faded and withered
Well sir and you witty lady who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk my name is Vincentio my hometown Pisa and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven’t seen in a long while
What is his name
Lucentio sir
A fortunate coincidence more fortunate for your son
The sister of my wife this lady here is married to your son
And there’s no need for wonder or worry
Let me embrace the father of Lucentio and then we’ll journey on to see your son who will rejoice at your arrival
I assure you sir it’s true
Well Petruchio all this is very encouraging
The priest is already there
We’re off Biondello
I’ll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master’s
I wonder why Cambio hasn’t shown up in all this time
Here is the door sir
This is Lucentio’s house
My father in law lives closer to the marketplace
That’s where I’m going now so I’ll leave you here
You must not go without having a drink first
They’re pretty busy in there
You’d better knock louder
Is Signior Lucentio at home sir
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around
I believe I have some choice in the matter sir
Come here you wretch
What have you forgotten me
Forgotten you
No sir
I could not forget you since I never saw you before in my life
My honorable reverend master
Yes of course
There he is at the window
Is that so
Help help help
This madman will murder me
How dare I
How dare    What is the man crazy
Your father
Why you scoundrel
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo
You’re wrong sir very wrong
Why what do you imagine his name to be
His name
Lucentio
Oh God he’s murdered his master
Oh my son my son
Tell me you monster where is my son Lucentio
Take this mad wretch to jail Father in law Baptista will you see that he’s available to appear in court
Take me off to jail
He mustn’t go to prison
Be quiet Signior Gremio
I say he shall go to prison
Be careful Signior Baptista lest you be made the dupe in this business
I could swear this is the real Vincentio
Well no not literally
No I know that you’re Signior Lucentio
Away with the doddering fool
Take him off to jail
We’re ruined
There he is
Pardon dear father
Dear son you’re alive
Pardon us dear father
What have you done
Where is Lucentio
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes
We’ve all been duped
Where is that damned wretch Tranio who defied me in such a disgraceful manner
Say isn’t this the Latin master Cambio
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio
It was love that performed these miracles
Bianca’s love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town
What Tranio did he did at my command
So pardon him dear father for my sake
No I’ll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail
But sir have you married my daughter without my consent
Don’t worry Baptista you’ll be perfectly satisfied
You’ll see
All I can hope for now is a share of the feast
Let’s follow them to see how this turns out
First kiss me Kate and then we will
What here in the middle of the street
Are you ashamed of me
But I’m ashamed to kiss sir
All right then back home we go
No wait
I  Isn’t this good
Come my sweet Kate
Better late than never and it’s never too late to change
Well thank God I’m cured
Amen
I thank you all
You won’t regret this
How is my noble lord
This is all quite pleasant
Where is my wife
Here noble lord
What is your wish with regard to her
You call yourself my wife yet you don’t call me “husband”
It’s my men who should call me “lord” I’m your man your fellow
My fair Bianca bid my father welcome while I with equal affection welcome yours
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting
Now everyone be seated as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat
I wish that were true for both our sakes
Hortensio
That’s very sensible but you missed my sense I meant Hortensio is afraid of you
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning
A very candid reply
What’s that supposed to mean
That’s what I conceive of him
Nice save
Kiss him for that good widow
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning” please tell me what you meant by that
Your husband being saddled with a shrew projects his own suffering onto my husband
And now you know my meaning
A very nasty meaning
My meaning  And I
You tell her widow
I’ll bet you a hundred marks my Kate puts her flat on her back
Well that’s really my job
Well said
Here’s to you
What do you think of these quick witted folks Gremio
They certainly do like to butt heads
Yes but not out of fear
I’ll go back to sleep now
No you shall not
I’ll
Well she got away
Signior Tranio you also took aim at that bird though you didn’t hit her So here’s a health to all who’ve shot and missed
A witty if a cynical reply
It’s good you hunted for yourself sir
Tranio got you that time
I thank you for that quip good Tranio
He’s made me a little sore I’ll admit
But since the gibe glanced off me ten to one it hit you both straight on
Seriously though son Petruchio I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all
Well I disagree
Agreed
What’s the bet
Twenty crowns
Twenty crowns
I’d wager twenty times as much on my wife
A hundred then
Agreed
Good
It’s a bet
Who should begin
I will
Biondello go and tell your mistress to come to me
Here I go
Son I’ll stake you half that Bianca comes
I’ll have no halves
What
She’s busy and cannot come” Is that an answer
Yes and a nice one at that
Pray God your wife doesn’t send you a worse one
I’m hoping for better
So where’s my wife
She says she thinks this is a prank
She will not come
She says that you should come to her
Worse and worse
She  I can guess her answer
What
She will not
By all that’s holy here comes Katherina
You sent for me sir
Where are your sister and Hortensio’s wife
They sit chatting by the parlor fire
Go bring them here
If they refuse to come get physical use a whip if you have to but get them out here to their husbands
This is a miracle if you talk of miracles
It is
I wonder what it means
It means peace and love and a quiet life supremacy based on reverence and profound respect and not to go on and on about it everything that’s sweet and happy
May good fortune come to you good Petruchio
You’ve won the wager and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you
Look here she comes with your ungovernable wives in tow like prisoners of her womanly persuasion Katherine that cap of yours doesn’t look good on you
Take it off and throw it on the ground
Lord may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that
For shame
What kind of loyalty is this
I wish your loyalty were as foolish
The wisdom of your loyalty fair Bianca has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty
There will be no lecture
She shall not
I say she shall And first begin with her
Girls girls
This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord your king your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king
And when she is peevish and perverse sullen sour and disobedient to his honest wishes what is she but a loathsome warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace that they seek authority supremacy and power when they are under an obligation to serve love and obey
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unfit for toil and trouble in the world if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts
Come come you weak ungovernable worms
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours my courage as great and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown
But now I see our weapons are like straws our strength like a straw’s weakness and our weakness past comparison so that we seem to be the thing we most are not
Come on and kiss me Kate
It’s nice to see children playing well together
But not so nice when women misbehave
Come Kate let’s go to bed
We three are married but you two are defeated
It’s amazing if I may say so that she let herself be tamed
Madam wife they say I’ve been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years
Yes and it seemed twice as long to me having been kept from your bed that whole time
That’s too long Servants leave her and me alone
Now madam undress and come to bed
Thrice noble lord I beg you to excuse me for another night or two or at least until nightfall
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you as there’s a risk that you might have a relapse
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse
I’m not sure I can wait that long
Still I’d hate to see my former dreams return
So I  Your Honor’s actors hearing of your recovery have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you and your doctors approve wholeheartedly
So they think it’s a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment two strong preventive medicines that foster long life
Okay bring on the play
What like stuff from a house
No it’s a story
Well let’s watch it
We’re not getting any younger
I was born in Pisa famous for its serious citizens like my father before me my father Vincentio a successful world traveled merchant was one of the
I’ll fix you I swear
You thug
Read your history
We You won’t pay for the glasses you smashed
No not a penny
Get out of my face
Go play with yourself
I know my rights
I’m not moving an inch pal
Let them come I don’t care
That’s good advice
Wait
Who are all these people
Maybe it’s a parade to welcome us to town master
Don’t worry I couldn’t care less
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool paint your face with blood and make a fool out of you
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her
Me too Lord
What a spoiled little brat
Sister be happy in my unhappiness Sir I will humbly obey you
I’ll take comfort in my books and music reading and practicing my instruments
Listen Tranio
That’s  Signior Baptista will you really be this cruel
Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell Signor Baptista
And because I know how fond she is of music playing her instruments and poetry I plan to hire live in tutors for her
Katherina you may stay
I don’t think so
Am I to be dictated to like a child
You can go straight to hell
So long
That is if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca’s love
And that would be 
To find a husband for her sister
A husband
You mean a devil
I mean a husband
I say a devil
Do you really think there’s a man fool enough to marry into hell however rich the father is
Oh I don’t know
Guys who’d take her with all her faults provided there were enough money involved
I don’t know
What do you say Signior Gremio
This imaginary suitor for Katherina I’d buy him the best horse in Padua if he’d get here quickly woo her marry her take her to bed and rid the house of her
Let’s go
Sir is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly
Oh Tranio until it happened to me I never would have thought it possible
The heart won’t be reasoned with
If love has touched you love has touched you end of story
Yes you’re right
Please go on
I feel better already and I know there’s more good advice where that came from
Master you were so focused on the girl herself I wonder if you missed the main point here
Oh no
Tranio I saw her coral pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath
Oh Tranio what a cruel father he is
Still did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her
I did and now I’ve got it
Tranio I think I’ve got it
I’ll bet we’re both thinking the same thing master
Tell me your idea first
You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl
It is
Do you think it would work
No not a chance
Enough
It’s obvious  Here comes Biondello
Where have you been boy
Where have  Come here boy
It’s no time for jokes sober up
Understand
Of course sir
And you’re not to utter a syllable of Tranio’s name
Wish I could say the same
I’d second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista’s youngest daughter
This is for your master’s sake not mine
When we’re by ourselves you can call me “Tranio” Everywhere else address me as your master Lucentio
Tranio let’s go
One last thing and this is up to you
You’ll have to woo Bianca like the rest
Don’t ask why
No no
Very impressive
Is there any more or is that it
And what an excellent piece of work it is too madam lady
I wish it were over
Huntsman look after my hounds
Let Merriman catch his breath the poor dog’s foaming at the mouth
I think Belman is just as good my lord
I swear he’s the better dog
You’re a fool
If Echo were as fast he would be worth a dozen like Belman
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well
I’ll go hunting again tomorrow I think
I will my lord
What’s this
A drunkard or a corpse
Check and see if he’s breathing
He is my lord
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn’t warmed himself with ale
Alas grim death how vile and ugly your near twin sleep is
What do you think
I’m off to visit my friends in Padua particularly my best friend Hortensio
And I think this is his house
Here you there Grumio
Knock
Knock sir
Whom should I knock
Has anyone offended your Worship
Moron
I’m telling you to make a fist and pound
My master is being difficult
Say what’s the trouble
If it isn’t my old friend Grumio and my dear friend Petruchio
How’s everyone in Verona
Hortensio have you come to break up the fight
I don’t care what he told you in Latin
I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it
Knock at the gate
Oh for Pete’s sake
Didn’t you clearly say “Knock” “pound” and “put your fists to work”
Now you say it was “Knock at the gate”
I’m warning you
Easy Petruchio
I’ll vouch for Grumio
Now my dear friend what lucky wind blows you in from Verona
The wind that scatters young men throughout the world encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home where there’s little to be found in the way of experience
I have money in my purse and property at home so I’m off to see the world
I doubt you’d thank me in the end but she’s rich all right very rich
But you’re too good a friend for me to wish her on you
Hortensio good friends like us can get by on a few words
I can help you find a wife who’s rich young beautiful and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman
Her only flaw and it’s a big one is that she’s unbearable a total witch so much so that I wouldn’t think of marrying her myself not even if I were in a worse fix than I am not for a whole goldmine
Hush Hortensio
You don’t know what money can buy
Her father is Baptista Minola a pleasant and courteous gentleman
Her name is Katherina Minola famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue
I don’t know her but I know her father and he knew mine well
I won’t sleep until I see her Hortensio
Wait Petruchio I should go with you
His youngest daughter the beautiful Bianca is the jewel of my life and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand
Katherine the shrew” That’s the worst thing you can call a young woman
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well versed in music
I’ll disguise myself in somber robes
Oh  Master master look
Who are these people
Hush Grumio
It is my rival for Bianca
Petruchio let’s stand over here awhile
Oh what an excellent thing this learning is
Good to see you Signior Hortensio
Do you know where I’m going
To Baptista Minola’s house
That’s great
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love
Gremio this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca
That’s good if he’ll really do it
Have you told him all her faults Hortensio
I know she is a hateful brawling scold
If that’s all gentlemen I see no problem
No
Tell me friend
Where are you from
My father’s dead and his fortune is mine now
I hope to see good days and many of them
Sir such a life with such a wife is unlikely
But if you have the stomach for it you’ll have all the help from me you need
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat
Why did I come here if not for that
I who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals
I who have heard the rumble of guns in battle and thunder in the sky (heaven’s version of artillery)
Listen Hortensio
Absolutely so long as he gets the girl
I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner
Is that the man you want
But not the woman who scolds anyway I hope
Sir a word before you go
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of yes or no
What if I am
Not if you go away there isn’t
Because if you must know she’s been chosen by Signior Gremio
Because she’s been chosen by Signior Hortensio
Wait a minute gentlemen
Be good enough to hear me out
Baptista is a noble gentleman one to whom my father is not completely unknown and lovely as his daughter is she is entitled to any number of suitors myself among them
I don’t think he’d have any choice my lord
When he woke he wouldn’t know where he was
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy
Well take him on up and we’ll try to pull it off
Carry him to my best room gently so he doesn’t wake and hang all my erotic paintings around him
Bathe his filthy head with warm scented water
Convince him that he has been out of his mind and when he says he’s out of his mind  My lord I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him
The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors
This fellow will out talk us all
Hortensio what’s all this about
Yes leave that labor to great Hercules it’s worse than the previous twelve put together
Sir that’s well said and well thought out
An excellent motion
Let’s go
I second that
Dear sister it’s unfair to me and unfair to yourself to turn me into a slave
That I won’t stand for
And don’t lie
You lying brat
It’s Hortensio isn’t it
Oh I see
You’ll live in luxury with Gremio
Is it because of
What in my presence
You mean you don’t even want to hear my side
Don’t talk to me
Now what
Good morning neighbor Baptista
Good morning neighbor Gremio
And to you good sir
Tell me don’t you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina
I have a daughter named Katherina sir
Please Signior Gremio
Allow me to continue I am a gentleman of Verona sir who hearing of your daughter’s beauty and wit her friendly disposition and bashful modesty her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I’ve heard is true
You and he are both welcome sir
As for my daughter Katherine this much I know she’s not for you more’s the pity
I see you don’t intend to part with her or perhaps you don’t like my company
Don’t misunderstand me sir
I’m just stating the facts as I see them
Where are you from
What’s your name
My name is Petruchio son of Antonio a man well known throughout Italy
I know him well
You are welcome for his sake
You’re  Forgive me Signior Gremio but I’m anxious to get things moving
No doubt but you may be going about it the wrong way Neighbor this gift is very gracious I’m sure
I myself who am more indebted to you than anyone have brought you this young scholar
Many thanks Signior Gremio
Welcome good Cambio
Your name is Lucentio you say
Of what city may I ask
A man of great influence
I know him well by reputation
You are very welcome here sir
Let’s take a little walk in the orchard before dinner
You are all most welcome here please make yourselves at home
Signior Baptista I’m actually in a bit of a hurry
You knew my father well therefore you know me the sole heir to all his property and possessions which I have added to rather than depleted
So tell me assuming I win your daughter’s love what dowry would she bring to the marriage
Twenty thousand crowns now and half my lands after my death
Let’s have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises
That counts for everything
Oh that’s nothing believe me sir
I’m as commanding as she is proud and when two raging fires meet they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them
I’m that great gust to her fire
Well good luck
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness
Mountains don’t tremble however much the wind may blow
Why so pale my friend
Will my daughter be a good musician do you think
I think she’ll be a better soldier
You don’t think you can teach her
I’ll give you frets” With that she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through
I like this girl
Now I want her more than ever
I can’t wait to meet her
Please do
I’ll wait for her here and when she comes I’ll take a novel approach with her
If she rants I’ll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale
If she glares I’ll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew
If she is silent and won’t speak at all I’ll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence
If she orders me to go I’ll thank her warmly as if she’d just offered to put me up for a week
If she refuses my proposal I’ll tell her how much I’m looking forward to the announcement and the wedding
Carry him gently to bed and every man be ready at his post when he awakes
Go lad and find out what the trumpet’s sounding for
It’s probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid journey thinking to spend the night here
Sir it’s a troupe of actors who want to perform for your Lordship
Have them come in
You are welcome here my friends
We thank your Honor
Were you thinking of spending the night here
Yes if that would be all right with your Lordship
By all means
I remember this fellow he once played the eldest son of a farmer
It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully
I have forgotten your name but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly
Good morning Kate for I hear that’s what you’re called
Is that what you’ve heard
Driven” Really
I had you figured for a piece of furniture
What do you mean by “furniture”
A nice stool
You’re right actually
Come sit on me
Asses are made for bearing and so are you
Women are made for
Not by the likes of you
I know how  Too light for a lout like you to catch though no lighter than I should be
Should be
If I’m a wasp look out for my stinger
All I have to do is remove it
True if a fool such as yourself could find it
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger
In its tail
No in its tongue
Whose tongue
Yours if we’re talking about  I’m leaving
You’re leaving with my tongue in your tail
No come back Kate
We’ll see about that
I swear I’ll smack you if you hit me again
Not if you want to keep your arms
It has no fighting spirit
Oh come on now Kate
Don’t look so sour
That’s my way when I see a crab apple
There’s no crab apple here so don’t look sour
There is a crab apple here
Show me
I would if I had a mirror
What you mean my face looks like a crab apple
You know you’re right
I probably am too young for you
Maybe but you’re wrinkled all the same
Oh that’s with worry
Well that doesn’t worry me
Let me go
No not a bit
I find you quite gentle
I was told that you were violent proud and sullen
You haven’t got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do
No you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation quiet and pleasant
Why does the world report that Kate is lame
The world’s a liar
Kate is as straight and slender as a hazel twig her hair as brown as hazelnut shells and she herself sweeter than the kernels
Take a few steps I want to see you walk
Did Diana ever beautify a grove as much as Kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements
It’s born of my  A witty mother
Too bad about the son
Am I not wise
I’m the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat Kate into a Kate as gentle and domestic as other household Kates
I almost recognize that voice
It’s But he’s drowned and these guys are devils
Oh God help me
Four legs and two voices a very special monster
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend
The other voice is harsh and abusive
If it takes all the wine in my bottle I’ll cure him
Come on
CALIBAN  Stephano
Is your other mouth calling my name
Mercy mercy
This isn’t a monster it’s a devil
I’ll leave him alone
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil
Stephano
If you’re Stephano touch me and speak to me
I’m Trinculo don’t be scared your good friend Trinculo
If you’re Trinculo then come out
I’ll pull on these smaller legs
If any legs here are Trinculo’s these are
But aren’t you drowned Stephano
I hope you’re not drowned
Has the storm passed
I hid under this monster’s cloak to get out of the storm
Are you really alive Stephano
Oh Stephano two men from Naples survived
Please stop turning me around
My stomach’s a little upset
I swam ashore like a duck
I can swim like a duck I swear
Here
Oh Stephano do you have any more of that wine
I’ve got the whole barrel man
You come from heaven don’t you
No from the moon I’m telling you
I used to be the man in the moon a long time ago
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush
I can’t believe I was scared of him
A pretty pathetic monster
The man in the moon
What a poor gullible monster That was a nice big gulp monster
What a lying drunken monster
When his god falls asleep the monster will snatch his wine bottle
Come on then
Get down and swear it
I’m going to laugh myself to death over this silly monster
A rotten foolish monster
I could find it in my heart to beat him  Come on kiss my feet
An awful monster
I’ll show you where to get fresh water
I’ll pick berries for you
I’ll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood
The tyrant I’m serving now can go to hell
What a silly monster to think a poor drunk is wonderful
Show us the way without further delay Trinculo since the king and all our comrades are drowned we’re the heirs of this place Here carry my wine bottle Trinculo my buddy we’ll get that bottle refilled soon enough
A loud mouthed drunken monster
Good monster
Show us the way
Right now I’d give a thousand
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons
And you can do poor things that lead to rich results
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me but I’m working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor
Oh she’s ten times nicer than her father is mean and he’s the height of crabbiness
I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up on strict orders from him
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me especially when I’m slaving away busily
Now please I beg you don’t work so hard
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you’ve been ordered to stack
Please put that log down and rest a while
When this wood burns it’ll weep for making you tired
My father’s studying hard so he won’t see you
So please rest
We’re safe from my father for at least three hours
Oh my dear mistress I won’t be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest
If you sit down I’ll carry your logs a while
Please give me that
I’ll take it over to the pile
I’d be as right for the job as you are and I’d do it more easily since I’d have good will on my side
You look tired
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers
Miranda Oh father I’ve disobeyed you by telling him that
I’ve looked at many ladies with pleasure and been
But with you it’s different
You’re perfect without a rival in the world made up of the best qualities of every creature
I’ve never known any woman or seen a woman’s face except my own in the mirror
And I’ve never met any men besides you and my father
I’m a prince by birth Miranda maybe even a king now though I wish I weren’t and normally I wouldn’t put up with carrying these logs any more than I’d let flies breed in my mouth
But I’ll tell you something from my soul
The second I saw you my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave so here I am now a patient log man
Do you love me
Oh heaven oh earth witness what I’m about to say and reward me if I tell the truth
If I’m lying then
More than anything else in the world I love you value you and honor you
Look at me crying what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy
Why are you crying
I’m crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what I’m dying to have
The more I try to hide what I’m feeling the bigger it gets
I’ll be your wife if you’ll have me
Otherwise I’ll die a virgin devoted to you
You can refuse to make me your spouse but I’ll be your servant whether you want me to or not
You’ll be my wife dearest and I’ll serve you forever
Will you be my husband then
A million goodbyes to you
Now it’s time to get back to my studying since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner
Don’t tell me that
When the barrel’s empty we’ll drink water
Not one drop sooner
Therefore drink up Servant monster drink a toast to me
Servant monster”
What a crazy island this is
They say there are only five people on it
We’re three of them
If the other two are as loopy as we are our country’s in bad shape
Drink when I order you servant monster
Your eyes look like they’ve sunk into your head
Where else should his eyes be if not in his head
He’d be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail
My man monster is so drunk he can’t talk
He’s not standing straight enough to hold a flag
We’re not going to run in our army Monsieur Monster
Or walk either
You’ll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing
Monster sweetie be a good monster and just speak once
How is your Highness
Let me lick your shoe
Lord” he calls you
What an idiot that monster is
Trinculo speak politely
If you mutiny against me I’ll hang you from the next tree
Thank you my noble lord
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier
I’ll stand and so will Trinculo
You lie
Trinculo if you interrupt him any more I swear I’ll knock some teeth out of your head
I didn’t say anything
Okay just stay quiet
Go on
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island
He stole it from me
If your highness is willing take revenge on him for that because I know you’re brave enough I don’t dare to  That’s for sure
You’ll be lord of the island then and I’ll be your servant
And how would we go about doing that
Can you bring me to him
Yes yes my lord
I’ll take you to where he sleeps and you can pound a nail into his head
You lie
You can’t do that
What an idiot this guy is You’re a rotten piece of work I beg your highness beat him up and take his wine bottle from him
When he loses that he’ll be drinking salt water since I’ll never tell him where the freshwater springs are
Trinculo watch out
If you interrupt this monster with one more word I’ll beat you like a piece of salted fish
What did I do
I didn’t do anything
I need to get away from you
Didn’t you call him a liar
You lie
I didn’t accuse you of lying
Are you out of your mind and deaf too
Damn your wine
Ha ha ha
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story Please go stand farther away
Beat him up
After a little while I’ll beat him too
Just as I told you he usually sleeps in the afternoon
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books or you can bash his skull with a log or you can stab him in the belly or cut his windpipe
Just remember to grab his books first since without them he’s just a poor fool like me and can’t command a single spirit
All the spirits hate him as much as I do
Be sure to burn his magic books
He has some wonderful home furnishings that’s what he calls them that he’ll use to decorate his house when he gets one
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is
He says she has no equal
I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax my mother
But Miranda is so much more beautiful you can’t even compare the two
Is she really that wonderful
Yes my lord
Monster I’ll kill this man
His daughter and I will be king and queen God protect us and you and Trinculo will be our governors Do you like that idea Trinculo
Excellent
Give me your hand
I’m sorry I hit you
But try to control your speech
In a half an hour he’ll be asleep
Will you kill him then
Dear father if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers please put an end to it
The sky’s so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren’t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out
Oh I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer
A fine ship with some good people in it I’m sure smashed to pieces
Their dying shouts broke my heart
The poor people died
If I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying
Calm down
There’s nothing to get upset about
No harm was done
Oh what a horrible day
There was no harm I’m telling you
It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know
Yes I swear
You make me so happy
I’m full of joy
Let’s be light hearted
I’ll do anything you ask monster anything reasonable Come on Trinculo let’s sing
That’s not the tune I had in mind
What’s this song
Oh forgive all my sins
Are you scared
No monster not me
Don’t be scared
This’ll be a wonderful kingdom to live in where they play music for free
As soon as you kill Prospero
That’ll happen soon enough
I remember the plan
The sound is going away
But let’s follow it and then do our dirty work afterward
Lead us monster we’ll follow
I wish I could see this invisible drummer
He really plays well
Are you coming monster
My old bones are tired
We’re wandering in a maze
If you don’t mind I need to rest a bit
I can’t blame you old lord
Sit down and rest
We’re searching on land but he’s lost in the sea
We have to give up and let him go
What’s that music
My friends listen
What marvelous music
Heaven help us
What were those things
Now I’ll believe that unicorns exist and that there’s a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives
Travelers have never told lies no matter what the fools at home accuse them of
If I told them about this back in Naples would they believe me
I’d tell them that I saw natives like these since they must be natives who are graceful and well mannered even if they’re monstrous to look at kinder than most human beings you might find  kinder than almost any human
They vanished strangely
It’s all right since they left their food behind and we’re hungry
Would you like to taste the banquet
Not me
I assure you sir there’s nothing to be afraid of
Brother Duke please have some food
Oh it’s horrible horrible
I thought the clouds were talking to me the winds were singing to me and the thunder like an awful organ pipe roared Prospero’s name
It sang about my crimes
I’ll go join him there going down deeper than any anchor ever sank and lie with him dead in the mud
I’ll fight every one of these devils if I have to one at a time
I’ll back you up
All three of them are crazy with despair
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them like a slow acting poison
Those of you who are young and active I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do
Follow them please
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place the heavens will not bless your relationship but will overwhelm you with hate contempt and discord and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it
You’ve said it well
So have a seat and talk to her
She’s yours Come Ariel
My trusty servant Ariel
What does my powerful master wish for
I’m here
You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well and now I need your help again
Go bring them all here I give you power over them
I’ve promised them I would and they’re expecting it
Right now
Yes right away
Before you can say “Come” and “Go” And breathe twice and shout “So so” Each one of your servants will rush here
It’s time for you to know the whole story
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak
Not yet” Well the time has come
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack
I doubt it since you weren’t even three at the time
Sure I can father
What do you remember
A house a person
Tell me anything you remember
I love you dearly Ariel
Don’t come near till you hear me call you
All right I understand
I assure you sir the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below
Good Now come Ariel
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed
Appear before me now quickly  No talking
Just watch
Be quiet
I have come to announce that Juno has asked you Ceres goddess of the fields and the earth to leave your rich farms of wheat rye barley oats and peas the hills where the
Why has your queen Juno called me here to this grassy spot
To celebrate a marriage of true love and give a gift to the lovers
Tell me rainbow do you know if either Venus the goddess of love or her son Cupid is accompanying Queen Juno
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year I swore I’d never speak to them again
Don’t be afraid of her company
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos in a carriage pulled by doves
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day
But their trick failed
Venus went home again and her little son broke all his arrows swearing he’ll never shoot them again but play with birds like other little boys
Great Queen Juno is coming
I know her by her walk
How is my generous sister
Come help me bless this couple so they will be prosperous and have many children
This is a majestic and harmonious vision
Are these spirits we see before us
Yes they’re spirits that I’ve called out of their prisons to perform my whims
Let me live here forever
Such a wonderful father in law and wife make this place a paradise
Now be quiet
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious
There’s something else to be done
Be silent or else my magic spell will be broken
Come sweet nymphs and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers
Don’t be late
Now you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of August’s labors get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here
Put your straw hats on have some fun and dance with these young nymphs
The moment they planned to act is almost here
I’ve never seen him like this
We are all made of dreams and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death
Sir I’m upset
Please put up with my weakness
My old brain is troubled
Don’t be disturbed by my illness
If you like you can rest a while in my room
I’ll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind
We hope you feel better and find some peace
Come Ariel I summon you with a thought
Thank you Ariel
Come
I obey all your thoughts
What do you wish
Spirit we have to get ready to meet with Caliban
Yes my master
When I was putting on the Ceres show I thought of reminding you about Caliban but I was afraid of upsetting you
Tell me again where did you leave those lowlifes
I told you sir they were totally drunk so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces and beating the ground for touching their feet yet even when drunk they kept their plan firmly in mind
Then I beat my drum at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes looking around for the source of my music
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins
In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room with the stinking water covering them up to their chins
Good job my little one
Stay invisible
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house to use as bait to catch these thieves
I’m going I’m going
He’s a devil a born devil who can never be trained
As his body grows uglier with age his mind rots away as well
I’ll torment them all till they roar with pain
Here hang them on this clothesline
Please walk softly so not even a mole hears us approach
We’re near his room now
Hey monster the spirit you’ve been talking about the one you call harmless has been playing tricks on us
Monster I smell like horse piss which is making my nose pretty upset
Mine too Are you listening monster
If I decide to get angry at you just watch out  You’d be done for then monster
My good lord I still need you to like me
Be patient because the prize I’m leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now
So be quiet
It’s as silent as a graveyard here
That upsets me much more than getting wet
And you called the fairy creature harmless monster
Please my king be quiet
Look here this is the entrance to his room
Be silent and go in
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever and will make me Caliban your worshipful foot licker
Give me your hand
I’m starting to feel murderous urges
Leave it alone you fool
It’s worthless
Oh monster we know secondhand clothes when we see them  Take off that gown Trinculo
I swear that gown’s for me
You can have it then your highness
To hell with this idiot
Why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes
Leave them alone and do the murder first
If he wakes up before we kill him he’ll never stop punishing us
Thank you kindly
Thank you for that joke
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it
Here’s another jacket to say thanks
Come here monster put some glue on your fingers and carry away the rest of these clothes for us
I won’t have any of this
Monster use your fingers
Help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden or I’ll kick you out of my kingdom
Go on take them
Take these too
Yes and these
Hey Mountain hey
Silver
There they go Silver
My memory is hazy more like a dream than a recollection
Didn’t I use to have four or five women taking care of me
Indeed you did and more besides Miranda
But how is it possible that you still remember this through all the darkness of the past
If you remember your life before you came here you may also remember how you got here
No that I don’t remember
Twelve years ago Miranda twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan a powerful prince
Aren’t you my father
Your mother was extremely virtuous and she said you were my daughter
And your father was Duke of Milan and you were his heir a princess
Good lord
What evil things were done to us that we were driven here
Or was it a blessing that we came here
Both both my girl
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds as you call them
Fury Fury Get over there Tyrant there
Listen listen
Ariel go order my goblin servants to make these fellows' bones ache give them muscle cramps all over and give them more bruises than leopards have spots
Listen they’re howling
Hunt them down
Now all my enemies are at my mercy
Soon all my work will be done and you’ll be free
Just obey me a little bit longer
My plans are almost at their climax
My spells are working well my spirits are obeying me and everything is right on schedule
What time is it
It’s after six o'clock my lord when you said our work would be finished
That’s what I said when I first conjured the tempest
Tell me spirit how’s the king and his entourage
All cooped up together just as you ordered all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather
They can’t move till you release them
The king his brother and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind and the rest are grieving over them sad and astonished
Good old lord Gonzalo” as you call him is saddest of all with tears running down his beard
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now you’d feel sorry for them
Do you think so spirit
I’d feel sorry for them if I were human
I will too
It’s better to act virtuously rather than vengefully
Go release them Ariel
I’ll break my spells and bring them back to their senses and they’ll feel like themselves again
I’ll go get them sir
With his own lightning bolts I’ve shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars I’ve opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them letting them out with my powerful magic
But I surrender all this magic now when I’ve summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell as I’m doing now I’ll break my staff and bury it far underground and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds which are now useless seething inside your skulls All of you stand there in my spell 
Why that’s my dainty Ariel singing now
I’ll miss you Ariel but you’ll be free Yes you will yes Go to the king’s ship in your invisible state
This place is full of trouble torments and amazements
There must be a strange explanation for this if it’s true
I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes
But how is it possible that Prospero’s alive and well and living on this island
I won’t bet on whether or not any of this is real
Welcome my friends
It’s the devil speaking through him
You suffered a loss like mine
Yes just as great and just as recent
And I have much less to comfort me than you do since I’ve lost my daughter
A daughter
Oh God I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples as king and queen
I’d give up my life and take my son’s place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples When did you lose your daughter
In this recent storm
These lords seem so astonished that they’ve lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes But whatever the reason for your losing your senses you can know for sure that I’m Prospero that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed and became the lord of it
No my dearest love I wouldn’t cheat you for the whole world
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up then I’ll lose my son twice
A wonderful miracle
Receive all the blessings of a happy father
Get up and tell me how you came here
How amazing
How many wonderful creatures there are here
Mankind is so beautiful
Oh what a wonderful new world that has such people in it
It’s new to you
No sir she’s human
But by the grace of God she’s mine
I chose her for my wife when I thought I had no father to ask advice of
She’s the daughter of this famous Duke of Milan I heard so much about but never saw before
He’s given me a second life and marrying her makes him a second father to me
And I’m her father as well
But oh how odd it is to have to ask for my child’s forgiveness
Stop right there sir
Let’s not get gloomy in our reminiscing since there’s no reason for sadness anymore
Oh it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this things that I can’t remember
But please tell me more
My brother your uncle Antonio just listen to this (I still can’t believe a brother could be so disloyal
My brother whom aside from you I loved more than anyone else in the world I trusted to run my state which at that time was the strongest in the land and Prospero the number one duke famous for my dignity and my education
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic grammar geometry and astronomy I let my control of the government slide a bit being too wrapped up in my occult books
Your disloyal uncle are you paying attention
I’m hanging on every word
Oh yes I am father
Dear gods bless this couple since you’re the ones who have shown us the path that led us here
Amen to that Gonzalo
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples
Oh this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis and Ferdinand her brother found a wife where he was shipwrecked Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves
So be it
Amen
Oh look sir look sir
More of us are here
The best news of all is that we’ve located our king and our men
The next bit of good news is that our ship which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago is as well outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail
These are unnatural events
In an instant we were separated from them as if in a dream and brought here in a daze
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before and it’s not natural either
We need some oracle to tell us what’s going on
Sir my king don’t waste your time mulling over how strange this business is
How is my lord
If I can believe my eyes this is a fine sight to see
Oh Setebos these are handsome spirits
How wonderful my master is
I’m afraid he’ll punish me
Ha ha
What are these things we’re looking at my lord Antonio
Can you buy them with money
He’ll kill me with tortures
Isn’t this Stephano my drunken butler
He’s definitely drunk now
Where did he get wine
And Trinculo’s drunk
How are you doing Stephano
Oh don’t touch me
I’m not Stephano I’m a walking cramp
You wanted to be king of the island sir
I would’ve been a sore king then
He’s as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance  I will indeed
And after this I’ll be good and hope you forgive me
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool
Go away now
Or stole it rather
And in the morning I’ll take you to your ship and we’ll sail to Naples where I hope to see this loving couple married
I’m dying to hear your life story which must be a strange tale
Now my spells are all broken And the only power I have is my own Which is very weak
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help
Just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven Indulge me forgive me and set me free
Please listen to me carefully
As I neglected practical matters being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was my trust which had no limit an infinite confidence
With his ambition growing like this do you hear what I’m saying
Of course I hear it
My library was a large enough dukedom for me
Good heavens
Think about that and about what followed afterward
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother
The king of Naples my arch enemy listens to my brother’s request which was that the king in exchange for the respect and money paid to him would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead
How awful
I can’t remember how I cried then but I’ll cry all over again
This story breaks my heart
Just listen a little more and I’ll bring you up to date about the present situation which is the whole reason I’m telling you this story in the first place
Why didn’t they just kill us that night
Good question my girl
My story does raise that question
The answer my dear is that they didn’t dare because the people of Milan loved me too much
God what a burden on you I must have been
No my dear you were a little angel who kept me going
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven while I cried salty tears into the salty sea and groaned at our situation
How did we manage to get ashore
With God’s help
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples Gonzalo had given us out of the kindness of his heart
Knowing how much I loved my books he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom
I wish I could see that man someday
Now I’ll stand up
May God thank you for it
But please father the question is still nagging at me why did you conjure up this storm
You should know this much luck is on my side and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island
Now no more questions
It’s a nice hazy feeling so give in to it
I know you have no choice
Come on servant come
I’m ready now
Come here Ariel
Humble greetings great master
Worthy sir greetings
Spirit did you carry out the storm just as I ordered
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once
I flashed about faster than lightning
Good spirit
Boatswain
I’m here sir
Hurry hurry
Come on men
That’s the way to do it
Where’s the Master
Make these men work
Please stay below deck sir
Where’s the Master Boatswain
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts
Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire
The king’s son Ferdinand with his hair standing straight up it looked like reeds not hair was the first person to jump shouting “Hell is empty and all the devils are here” Good job
But was this near the shore
Very near my master
But are they all safe Ariel
Nobody was hurt in the slightest
Even their clothes are unstained and look fresher than before the storm
I’ve separated them into groups around the island just as you ordered
I sent the king’s son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island where he’s sitting now sighing with his arms crossed like this
Tell me what you did with the king’s ship the sailors and the other ships
The sailors are all below deck sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them
As for the rest of the ships I scattered them and they’ve gathered again in the Mediterranean sailing sadly home to Naples believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king
Ariel you’ve done your work exactly as I ordered
But there’s more work to be done
What time is it
Past noon
At least two hours past
We can’t waste time between now and six o'clock
Is there more work to do
Since you’re giving me new assignments let me remind you what you promised me but haven’t come through with yet
What
You’re in a bad mood
What could you possibly ask for
My freedom
Before your sentence has been completed
Don’t say anything else
I beg you remember the good work I’ve done for you and how I’ve never lied to you never made mistakes and never grumbled in my work
You promised to take a full year off my sentence
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from
No
You have forgotten and you think it’s a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean or run on the north wind or do business for me underground when the earth’s frozen solid
No I don’t sir
You lie you nasty ungrateful thing
Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax stooped over with old age and ill will
Have you forgotten her
No sir
You have
Where was she born
Speak
Tell me
In Algiers sir
Oh was she now
I’ll have to tell the story again every month since you seem to forget it
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about
But for one reason they refused to execute her
Isn’t that true
Yes sir
This sunken eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors
You my slave were her servant at the time as you admit yourself
In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree with the help of her powerful assistants and left you there for twelve years
That’s right you stupid thing
Caliban who now serves me
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you making the pine tree open and let you out
Thank you master
If you complain any more I’ll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you’ve howled for twelve years
Please forgive me master
I’ll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining
Do that and I’ll set you free in two days
That’s noble of you master
What shall I do for you
Just tell me
What shall I do
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me
Take this garment put it on and then come back here
Hurry go
Shake off your sleepiness
Come on
We’ll go visit Caliban my slave who always talks to us so nastily
But even so we can’t do without him
He builds our fires gets our firewood and does all kinds of useful things for us Hey
Caliban
Pile of dirt
Say something
Come out I order you
There’s other work for you to do
Come on you turtle
What a fine sight
My dear clever Ariel listen carefully
My lord I’ll do it right away
I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow’s feather from the poison swamps
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over
I’ll give you cramps for saying that horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing
I’ll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you
You’ll be pricked all over and it’ll sting like bees
I have to eat my dinner now
This island belongs to me because Sycorax my mother left it to me
I curse myself for doing that
You liar you respond better to the whip than to kindness
I took good care of you piece of filth that you are and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter
Oh ho oh ho
I wish I had
You stopped me
You horrid slave you can’t be trained to be good and you’re capable of anything evil
I pitied you worked hard to teach you to speak and taught you some new thing practically every hour
But you had bad blood in you no matter how much you learned and good people couldn’t stand to be near you
So you got what you deserved and were locked up in this cave which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be
You taught me language and all I can do with it is curse
Damn you for teaching me your language
No please
Go then slave
The watchdogs bark
Listen listen
Where’s that music coming from
From the earth or the air
It’s stopped now it must be played for some local god of the island
As I sat on the shore crying over my father’s shipwreck I heard the music creep over the wild waves calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies
I followed it here or I should say it dragged me here
But now it’s stopped
No there it is again
Listen I hear them
This song’s about my dead father
I hear it now overhead
What is it
A spirit
Lord it’s glancing every which way
How handsome it is
It must be a spirit
No girl
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do
He’s lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them
He’s busy can’t you hear him giving orders
You’re getting in the way of our work
Stay in your cabins
You’re helping the storm not us
Don’t get wound up my good man
Now get out of here
Go to your cabins and be quiet
Don’t bother us up here
Just remember who you’ve got on board with you good man
Nobody I care about more than myself
You’re a king’s advisor
Go ahead use your authority
If you can’t do it be grateful you’ve lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin if it comes to that Harder men Now get out of our way I’m telling you
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy
I could imagine he’s divine since I never saw anything so noble looking on earth before
I’m not marvelous sir but I’m certainly a maiden
She speaks my language
My God I’m the highest ranking person who speaks this language if only we were back where it’s spoken
What’s that
The highest ranking
What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that
He would just see me for what I am a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples
He does hear me and that makes me cry
I myself am the King of Naples since I saw with my own eyes these eyes that haven’t been dry since my father killed in a shipwreck
Ah how pitiful
Yes indeed and all the King’s men the Duke of Milan and his fine son too
Hang on sir
Just a moment
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body then good things would fight to live in it
What’s that
Get out of that position because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop
Please father I beg you
Let go of me
Don’t tug on my clothes
Father take pity on him
Quiet
If you say one more word I’ll punish you maybe even hate you
You’re defending an impostor
You think he’s special since you’ve only ever seen him and Caliban
Foolish girl in the eyes of most people this man’s a Caliban and compared to him they’re angels
Then my love is humble
I don’t feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one
That’s true they are
My strength is all gone as if in a dream
The death of my father my physical weakness the loss of all my friends the threats of this man who’s taken me prisoner all that would be easy for me to take if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl
A prison like that would give me enough liberty
Please say no more
What a pain
Pain yes indeed
You thought you were being funny but you said the truth
You’re taking it more seriously than I meant it
Well I’m nearly finished
Which one will start yammering first Gonzalo or Adrian
The old guy
I pick the younger one
You’re on
What’s the prize
A good laugh
It’s a deal
Though this island may appear desolate 
The island must be mild and have a temperate climate
I knew Temperance she was a fine girl
Yes and she was mild too
There’s always a breath of fresh air here
Stinking like a swamp
This island contains everything beneficial to life
True
Everything except something to live on
There’s little or nothing of that
Look how lush and healthy the grass is
How green
The ground is brown
With a touch of green in it
He doesn’t miss a thing
No he just gets reality completely wrong
But the really unbelievable thing is and this is incredible  As most unbelievable things are
That our clothes were drenched with sea water but they came out looking brand new
Or stuff what he says into their pockets
Seriously I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa when we attended the marriage of the king’s daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis
It was a lovely wedding and we’re doing really well on our trip home
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen
Next thing you know he’ll be saying “widower Aeneas” “Widow Dido” did you say
I’m not sure about that
Dido was from Carthage not Tunis
Carthage
I’m telling you it was Carthage
Gonzalo is a miracle worker
What miracle will he work next
I think he’ll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple
And then throw the seeds in the sea to make more islands grow
Yes indeed
Absolutely yes indeed
Bring down that top sail
Fast
Let the ship sail close to the wind
Damn those men shouting down there
They’re louder than the storm or us sailors
Oh not you again
What do you want
Should we all give up and drown
Do you want to sink
Yes I guarantee he won’t drown even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman
Turn the ship to the wind
It’s no use
We’re done for
The most beautiful queen they ever had
I beg your pardon except for the widow Dido
Oh except for the widow Dido
That’s right except for the widow Dido
Isn’t my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on
In a way I mean
In a way” is the right way to go
I mean when I wore it at your daughter’s wedding
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don’t want to hear
Sir he may still be alive
I have no doubt he got ashore alive
No no he’s dead
Please be quiet
We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you
Now I’m afraid we’ve lost your son forever
Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them
And it’s all your fault
And the greatest sorrow is mine too
My lord Sebastian even though what you say is true your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time
You’re rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages
All right I’ll stop
Like a good doctor
Bad times
Yes very bad
If I could colonize this island my lord  He’d cultivate weeds on it
Or thorn bushes
And if I were king of it you know what I’d do
He wouldn’t get drunk much since there’s no wine here
I wouldn’t allow any commerce
There’d be no work
There’d be no kingship  He wants to be king in a place with no kingship
Everything would be produced without labor and would be shared by all
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance to feed my innocent people
There’d be no marriage
No
Oh please be quiet
You’re absolutely right your highness
It’s you we were laughing at
Ouch what a comeback
Too bad it fell flat
You’re brave gentlemen
You’d give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit
That’s right and then after we fixed the moon we’d go bird hunting
I’m not
Go to sleep and listen to us laughing
What everybody falls asleep so fast
I wish I could sleep too it would stop me from thinking
Come to think of it I am feeling sleepy
In that case you should sleep
The two of us will guard you while you sleep my lord and keep you safe
Thank you
I’m terribly sleepy
How strange that they all got so sleepy
There must be something in the air here
So why aren’t our eyelids heavy
I’m not sleepy at all
Me neither
I’m wide awake
They all fell asleep together as if they’d planned it
Opportunity’s knocking for you and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head
Are you dreaming or awake
Don’t you hear me speaking
I do and it sounds like you’re talking in your sleep
What did you say
You’re snoring but it sounds like you’re talking
There’s meaning in your snoring
I’ll show you how
You need to
Oh if you only knew how close to success you are even while you make fun of what I’m telling you
The more you joke about it the more clearly I feel how serious it is
Lazy people end up at the bottom and you deserve to be at the top
Please tell me more
Yes I’m sure he’s dead
I’ve got no hope that he survived
But in that “no hope” there are great hopes for you
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned
He’s dead
So in that case tell me who’s next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples
Claribel his daughter
It’s true that my brother’s daughter is Queen of Tunis and heir of Naples
I could do it myself
Do you even get what I’m saying
I think I do
And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero
My brother’s servants used to be my equals
Now they work for me
But what about your guilty conscience
Yes
I don’t feel anything
As
for the other men we can make them believe anything we choose
They’ll set their watches to whatever time we say
You’ll be my role model
Just as you got Milan I’ll get Naples
Take out your sword
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples
And as king I’ll love you forever
You take out your sword too
When I raise my hand you do the same and bring it down on Gonzalo’s head
Oh but there’s one more thing to tell you
What we’re going to die
The king and the prince are praying
I’m out of patience
This bigmouth jerk here ( He’ll still die by hanging not drowning even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him
Let’s all sink with the king
Let’s say goodbye to him
Let’s act quickly
Why are your swords out
Why do you look like that
What’s this all about
While we were here guarding you as you slept we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls or lions
Didn’t you hear it
We heard it very clearly
I didn’t hear anything
Oh it was a monstrous roar to make the earth tremble
I’m sure there was a herd of lions nearby
Did you hear this Gonzalo
It’s true I heard a humming sound a strange one which woke me up
I shook you and shouted at you sir
When I opened my eyes I saw their swords out
There was a noise that’s certainly true
Let’s draw our own swords too
I hope those lions stay far away from him
I’m sure he’s somewhere on the island
Get us out of here
His spirits are listening to me but I can’t help cursing him anyway
They won’t pinch me frighten me push me in the mud or mislead me unless he tells them to
Sometimes snakes wrap around me hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy
Hey look over there
Maybe he won’t see me
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here
And there’s another storm brewing I can hear it in the way the wind whistles
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that’s about to pour out its contents
A strange fish
If I were in England now like I was once and I had even a painted picture of this fish every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it
In England this strange monster would be just like a man
Any strange beast there can be considered a man
The men there won’t give a penny to a lame beggar but they’ll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms
And he’s still warm by God
I guess this is not a fish but a native who got struck by lightning just now
Oh here comes the storm again
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak
There’s no other shelter around here
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks
I’ll just stay here till the storm passes
This is a rotten song to sing at a man’s funeral
At least I’ve got some booze to comfort me
Don’t hurt me
Oh
What’s going on
Do we have devils on the island
Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies ha
I didn’t survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now
The spirit is torturing me
Oh
This is some monster of the island with four legs who seems to me to have some kind of ache
How the hell does he know our language
I’ll help out if only because he speaks the same language as me
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him and get him back to Naples he’d make a great present for any emperor
Don’t hurt me please
I promise I’ll carry the wood faster
He’s having a fit and talking nonsense
I’ll give him some liquor
If he’s never drunk it before it’ll help soothe his fever
If I can tame him I’ll charge as much as I can get for him
He’ll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him that’s for sure
Now you lie there on the path
She said if she were interested in someone it would be someone who looked like me
Besides she treats me more respectfully than the other servants
What’s the obvious conclusion from that
Just think I could be Count Malvolio
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager
I’d send seven of my servants to go get him
While I waited I’d frown impatiently and perhaps wind my watch or play with my with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing
I can’t let my lips say his name “No man must know”
No man must know” What comes after that
No man must know” What if this someone were you Malvolio
But silence like a knife cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood
rules my life” Hmm let me see let me see let me see
I may command the one I love” Well she commands me
Why anyone can see what this means
There’s no ambiguity here
If only I could somehow relate them to me
You seem to be a good person captain and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners
Please and I’ll pay you plenty for this help me conceal my identity and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want
I want to be this Duke’s servant
You’ll introduce me to him as a eunuch
You won’t be wasting your time because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music so he’ll be happy to have me in his service
You can be a eunuch but I’ll be mute
I swear on my life I won’t tell your secret
Thank you
Show me the way
M” Malvolio
M” why that’s the first letter in my name
But if I shake it up a little it’ll work because every one of those letters is in my name
But wait there’s some prose after her poem
If this letter falls into your hands think carefully about what it says
By my birth I rank above you but don’t be afraid of my greatness
Some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them
Your fate awaits you
Accept it in body and spirit
To get used to the life you’ll most likely be leading soon get rid of your low class trappings
Go ahead
Goodbye
Signed she who would be your servant     The Fortunate Unhappy” This is as clear as sunlight in an open field
I’ll do it
I’ll be vain and proud I’ll read up on politics I’ll insult Sir Toby I’ll get rid of my lower class friends and I’ll be the perfect man for her
I know I’m not fooling myself or letting myself get carried away by my imagination because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs
Oh I thank my lucky stars I’m so happy
For her I’ll be strange and condescending and I’ll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away
Thank God and my horoscope
Here’s a postscript
You must have figured out who I am
If you love me let me know by smiling at me
You’re so attractive when you smile
Please smile whenever you’re near me my dearest darling”
Dear God thank you
I’ll do everything she wants me to do
I wouldn’t have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds to be paid by the shah of Persia
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up
So could I
And I wouldn’t ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one
Neither would I
Here she comes the brilliant fool catcher
May I kiss your feet
And I too
Shall I be your slave
Me too
You’ve made him so delusional he’ll go crazy when he learns the truth
Did it really work
Like medicine for a sick man
If you want to watch follow me
I’d follow you to the gates of Hell you sneaky little devil
I’ll come too
God bless you my friend and your music too
Do you make your living by playing that drum
No sir I live by the church
Oh you’re a clergyman
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him or that the church is supported by your drum because it “stands by” your drum
You’re right sir
What a wonderful time to be alive
That’s true
That’s why I wish my sister didn’t have a name sir
Why man
Well her name’s a word and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore
Why do you say that
Honestly sir I’d need to use words to explain why and since words are so unreliable and false I’d rather avoid using them in a serious discussion
I bet you’re a happy fellow who doesn’t care about anything
You’re wrong sir I do care about something
But I’ll admit I don’t care for you
If that means I don’t care about anything you should disappear right now since you’re nothing
Aren’t you Lady Olivia’s fool
No sir
I saw you at Count Orsino’s recently
I’m everywhere
I think I saw you there you wise man
Wait here’s a coin for you
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair I hope he gives you a beard
Oh I know
Yes if you kept them together and invested them
My lady Olivia’s inside sir
I’ll tell them where you come from though I don’t know who you are or what you want
I’d say I was “out of my element” but that phrase is overused so I’ll say I’m “out of my air”
This guy’s wise enough to play the fool and only clever people can do that
And he doesn’t let go of his target when a distraction appears
Hello sir
Hello to you too sir
I’m headed for your niece sir
She’s the reason I’m here
Taste your legs sir
Please go inside
I mean please go into the house sir
I will
But now we don’t have to
Oh beautiful and accomplished lady may the heavens rain odors upon you
My message is not for anyone else to hear my lady
It’s only for your willing and receptive ear
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message
Give me your hand sir
I give you my obedience and my humble service madam
What’s your name
Cesario is my name your servant’s name fair princess
My servant
The world’s gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments
As for him I never think about him
As for his thoughts I wish he’d think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time
Madam I’ve come here to try to make you like him
Oh please I’m begging you don’t mention him again
My dear lady  Please let me say something I’m begging you
After you cast your magic spell on me last time I sent you a ring
What else could you possibly think of me
What’s wrong with my niece
For God’s sake Sir Toby you’ve got to come home earlier at night
My lady Olivia your niece disapproves of your late night partying
Well she can get used to it
Keep myself
They’re good enough to drink in and so are these boots
If they aren’t they can go hang themselves by their own laces
Who Sir Andrew Aguecheek
Yes that’s the one
He’s as
Haven’t you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough
So let me hear what you have to say
I feel sorry for you
That’s a step in the direction of love
No not at all
It’s much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one
I wish you all the best
You do Stay Please tell me what you think of me
I think you’re denying what you really are
If that’s true I think the same thing about you
I wish you were what I wanted you to be
Would it be better if I were that instead of what I am
I wish I were something better because right now I’m a big fool
So goodbye my lady
No I won’t stay a second longer
Why are you leaving my angry friend
Yes you have to tell us why Sir Andrew
Well because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count’s messenger better than she’s ever treated me
I saw it in the orchard
Did she see you there the whole time old boy
Tell me that
Yes she saw me quite clearly
Well that proves she’s in love with you
Are you trying to make fun of me
No I’ll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument
And you can’t deny evidence and argument They’ve been around since Noah’s ark
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you fire up your passions and make you angry and jealous
You should have run up to her unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot and rendered the young man speechless
That’s what she was expecting and you let her down
I’ll have to do something courageous then because I hate intrigue
I’d rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots
Well then improve your situation with a show of courage
Challenge the count’s young servant to a fight
Hurt him in eleven different places
My niece Olivia will notice and let me tell you no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage
It’s really the only way Sir Andrew
Will either of you give him the message that I’m challenging him to a duel
Go ahead and write it down
Be pointed and brief
It doesn’t need to be witty as long as it’s eloquent and imaginative
Go on
This precious little guy is putty in your hands Sir Toby
His letter’s going to be hilarious
But you’re not going to deliver it are you
Never trust me again if I don’t
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it
I don’t think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight
Here comes my little bird
Listen if you want a good laugh and I mean a side splitting one then follow me
He’s wearing yellow stockings
With crisscrossed laces
Oh he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies
You’ve never seen anything like it
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him
I know that my lady’s going to end up hitting him
And when she does he’ll imagine she’s flirting with him
Come on take us to him
I couldn’t stay behind after you left
My friend Antonio all I can say is thank you
Anyway what should we do
Should we go see the sights in the town
You probably killed a lot of his men
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them which most of our city did for the sake of friendly trade relations
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole
Then don’t make yourself too conspicuous
You’re right
Hang on a minute here’s some money for you
Maybe you’ll see some little trinket you want to buy
I’ll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour
We’ll meet at the Elephant
I remember
I’ve sent for him
He says he’ll come
It’s easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them
Oh I’m talking too loud Where’s Malvolio
He’s very serious which is right for someone in mourning like me
Where is Malvolio
He’s coming madam but he’s acting very strangely
He must be possessed by the devil
Why what’s the matter with him
Is he talking nonsense
No he just smiles
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here because he’s clearly disturbed
Ask him in here
I’m as crazy as he is if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent
What’s going on Malvolio
Hello sweet lady
Why he has an income of three thousand ducats a year
He’s a fool and a spendthrift
You shouldn’t talk about him like that
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage
Who said that
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night
We only drink toasts to my niece
I’ll drink to her as long as there’s a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry go round is scum
Sir Toby Belch
How are you Sir Toby Belch
Sweet Sir Andrew
You’re smiling
I sent for you about a sad occasion
Sad my lady
I could be sad if I wanted to be
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit but who cares
As the sonnet says “If you please one special person you please everyone who matters” Why what’s going on
What’s the matter with you
My legs may be yellow but I don’t feel blue
It was addressed to him and orders must be obeyed
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was
Don’t you think you should go to bed Malvolio
To bed
How are you feeling Malvolio
You’re asking me
Noble people don’t answer to peasants
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady
Don’t be afraid of greatness” That was well written
What do you mean by that Malvolio
Some are born great ”
What
Some achieve greatness ” What are you saying
And some have greatness thrust upon them” Heaven help you
Remember who liked your yellow stockings ” Your yellow stockings
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs” Crisscrossed
Go ahead
Madam Count Orsino’s young messenger has returned
I’ll go to him
Maria take care of this poor fellow here
Where’s my cousin Toby
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio
I’d give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him
Oh ho
Look at me now
This is just what the letter said
Get rid of your low class trapping” she said
I’ve got her now but I’ve got God to thank for it
And when she left just now she said “Take care of this poor fellow here” Fellow” Not “Malvolio” not anything referring to my low station in life but “fellow” Everything’s going perfectly
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes
Well God is responsible for that not me and he deserves thanks
I don’t care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him I still want to speak to him
Here he is here he is
How are you sir
Go away
Let me enjoy my privacy
Go away
Ah ha
Does she
Do you even know what you’re talking about
Sure thing we’ll do it tomorrow morning
My lady would never want to lose him
What are you saying mistress
Oh Lord
Gentleness is the only way to go gently gently
The devil inside him is rough but we can’t treat it roughly
Sir
Yes dear little chick come along with me Shut up man
You’re serious enough to know not to play games with Satan
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil
Get him to say his prayers Sir Toby get him to pray
My prayers you hussy
Go hang yourselves all of you
You’re all lazy and shallow
I’m not like you
You’ll know more about it later
Is it possible
If this were a play I’d complain it was unrealistic
He’s really taken this prank to heart
No follow him now before he divulges the prank and ruins everything
Wow we’re really going to drive him crazy
The house will be so much quieter
Come on let’s put him in a dark room and tie him up
My niece already thinks he’s insane
Here’s more insanity for us
Is it that aggressive
Yes it is I think
Just read it
Give it to me
That’s a good thing to put in it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law
Nice and short and full of good sense or should I say nonsense
Good
You still haven’t said anything incriminating
Good
Andrew Aguecheek”
If this letter doesn’t make him fight I don’t know what will
I’ll give it to him
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now
He’s conducting some business with my lady and sooner or later he’ll leave
Go Sir Andrew
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff’s deputy
Now go
Don’t worry about me not swearing enough
The fact that he serves as a go between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this
So this letter which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant isn’t going to scare him at all
He’ll just think an idiot wrote it
But I’ll deliver Sir Andrew’s challenge by word of mouth describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious impetuous and a skilled fighter (he’ll believe me because he’s young)
This will make them both so afraid that they’ll kill each other just by looking at each other
Here comes the messenger with your niece
Leave them alone until he sets off home and then follow him
Meanwhile I’ll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do
Here take this piece of jewelry
There’s a picture of me inside
Don’t refuse it
It won’t annoy you like me because it doesn’t have a voice
And I beg you please come here again tomorrow
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn’t give you as long as it didn’t damage my honor and self respect
Nothing except your true love for my lord
How could I honorably give him what I’ve already given you
I’ll give it back to you
Just come again tomorrow
Good bye
A devil like you could lead me to hell
Hello sir
Hello to you
You’d better think up a way to defend yourself
I don’t know what you’ve done to upset him but someone has challenged you to a duel
Draw your sword and get on your toes because your assailant is quick skillful and deadly
There must be some mistake sir
I’m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me
I can’t remember anything I’ve ever done to offend anyone
You’re wrong about that I assure you
But who is this person sir
He’s a knight
He’s killed three people and he’s so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die
Fight to the death” is his motto
Hello sir
Chat her up Sir Andrew
What
My dear Miss Chat her up I look forward to getting to know you better
My name is Mary sir
I was telling you to go after her woo her confront her
Is that really what you meant
If you let her go this easily Sir Andrew you don’t deserve to ever use your sword again
If you leave like this my dear I won’t ever use my sword again
Do you think you’ve got a couple of fools on your hands here
I’m not holding your hand sir
I’ll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort
I’m not a fighter
I’ve heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose just to see how brave they are
This man is probably like that
No sir
He’s furious because you insulted him and he has a right to satisfaction
So go out there and give him what he wants
You can’t go back into the house unless you want to fight with me and if you’re willing to do that you might as well just go and fight with him
This is as rude as it is strange
Please do me this one favor find out what I’ve done to offend this knight
It must be something I did accidentally
I will do so
Mr Fabian stay with this gentleman until I come back
Excuse me sir do you know anything about this
What kind of man is he
He really is the most skillful bloodthirsty and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria
Do you want to go see him
I’ll try to calm him down for you if I can
I’d be very grateful to you if you did
Wow he’s a real devil
I’ve never seen such a monster
I had a round with him and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can’t even duck out of the way
And when he strikes back at you he’ll hit you as sure as you’re standing there
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia
That’s it
I won’t mess with him
Yes but now there’s no way to calm him down
Fabian can hardly control him over there
Darn it if I’d guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman I never would have challenged him
I’ll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing
I’ll give it a try
Stay right here and try to look good
This may end without anyone getting killed
He’s just as terrified of Sir Andrew
He’s pale and hyperventilating as if a bear were chasing him
Come on Sir Andrew there’s nothing you can do about it
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you for the sake of his honor
The rules of dueling say he has to
But as a gentleman and a soldier he’s promised me he won’t hurt you
Come on get ready
I hope to God he keeps his promise
I swear to you I don’t want to be doing this
Put your sword away
If this young gentleman has offended you I’ll take the blame for it
If you’ve offended him I’ll fight you
You sir
Who are you
In fact I’d do even more to him than what you’ve heard him promise to do
If you’re someone who gets into fights I’ll fight with you
Oh Sir Toby stop
The police are here
I certainly will sir
And as for what I promised to you I’m as good as my word
You can ride him easily and he responds well when you pull the reins
This is the man
Do your job
Antonio you’re under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino
You must be mistaking me for someone else sir
No sir not at all
I recognize your face perfectly even without a sailor’s cap on your head Take him away
He knows I recognize him
I have to obey
Don’t worry about me
Come on sir let’s go
What money sir
Take this
It’s half of all my money
Are you really going to pretend you don’t know me now
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying vanity babbling drunkenness or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to  Oh my God
Come on sir please
Let’s go
Let’s go
But oh what a deceiver he turned out to be
Only really cruel people can be called deformed
Virtue is beauty but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil
The man’s going crazy
Take him away
Take me
I don’t believe it
Yet I wish I could
Oh please be true please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you my dear brother
Come here Sir Andrew
You too Fabian
We’ve got some words of wisdom to mull over
He called me Sebastian
with the same accessories
Oh if it turns out to be true that he survived then that storm was kind and the ocean was full of love
He’s a very dishonest puny boy and more cowardly than a rabbit
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency and even pretended he didn’t know him
As for his cowardliness ask Fabian
He’s a coward a total coward
By God I’ll go after him again and beat him up
I swear I will  Come on let’s go see what happens
I’ll bet anything you like that nothing will happen once again
Leave me alone
Good for you holding out on me like this
No I don’t know you and my lady didn’t send me to get you and I’m not supposed to tell you to come speak with her and your name is not Master Cesario and this is not my nose either
Nothing is what it is
Oh please go somewhere else to blab your nonsense
You don’t know me
Blab my nonsense
He must’ve heard that phrase describing some great man and now he’s using it on a jester
Blab my nonsense
What an idiotic place this world is
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady
Should I blab to her that you’re coming
Please fool go away
Here’s money for you
Well well
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years
Stop right now or I’ll throw your dagger over the roof
No leave him alone
I’ll get back at him another way
I’ll sue him for assault and battery if there’s any justice in Illyria
It doesn’t matter that I hit him first
No sir I won’t let you go
Come on put your sword away my little soldier
You’re awfully eager to fight
Come on
I’ll get free of you
What are you going to do now
If you insist on trying my patience any further then take out your sword right now
What
Because then I’d have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood
Stop Sir Toby
I order you to stop
Madam
Are you always going to be like this
Get out of my sight Dear Cesario please don’t be offended Get out of here you barbarian
You have to come with me
Please don’t say no
Damn that Toby
He made my heart leap for you
Why sweetheart
Your hand is  Well I hope so
I’m not such an idiot that I can’t keep my hands dry
But I don’t get it what’s the joke
Just a bit of my dry humor sir
Are you always so funny
But oops when I let go of your hand I let go of the biggest joke of all
Sir you need a drink
When has anyone ever put you down like that
Never
Sometimes I think I’m no smarter than average
If this is a dream let me keep on sleeping
Come with me please
I wish you’d do what I ask
Madam I will
Oh say it and mean it
No I’m telling you put on this robe and beard
Make him think you’re Sir Topas the priest
Be quick
Meanwhile I’ll get Sir Toby
Here come the conspirators
God bless you Mr
Priest
Go to him Sir Topas
The fool’s a good actor
A good fool
Sir Topas Sir Topas good Sir Topas please go find my lady Olivia  Get out demon
Why are you bothering this poor man
Can’t you talk about anything besides ladies
You should be ashamed of yourself Satan you liar
I’m being gentle with you because I’m one of those good hearted people who are polite to the devil himself
You call this house dark
Dark as hell Sir Topas
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls and the upper windows facing south north are as clear as coal
But you’re still complaining of darkness and a bad view
I’m not insane Sir Topas
I’m telling you this house is dark
You’re wrong you madman
There’s no darkness except ignorance and you’re more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog
I tell you this house is as dark as ignorance
I’m no more insane than you are and I’ll prove it
Ask me any commonsense question
What was the philosopher Pythagoras’s belief about wild birds
That our grandmother’s soul could end up inhabiting a bird
What do you think of his belief
I respect the soul very much so I disagree with his belief
Well then goodbye
Stay in the dark
I’ll only admit that you’re sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother’s soul
Goodbye
Sir Topas Sir Topas
The brilliant Sir Topas
I can do anything
You could’ve done this without your beard and gown
He couldn’t see you
Now talk to him in your own voice and tell me how he is
I wish this trick would be over
I’m in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn’t be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion
Come to my room later on
Fool
Fool
Fool I say
Good fool good jester I’ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle and a pen ink and paper
You have my word as a gentleman that I’ll always be grateful to you
Master Malvolio
Yes good fool
As sane as me
Then you really are insane if you’re no saner than a fool
Sir Topas
Fool fool hey fool
Please sir be quiet
What do you want to say sir
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper
I tell you I’m as sane as any man in Illyria
If only you were sir
I swear I am
Get me some ink paper and a candle
You’ll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before
I’ll help you
But tell me honestly are you sure you’re not insane
Or are you just pretending
Believe me I’m not
I’m telling the truth
I’ll never believe a madman until I can see his brains
But I’ll get you a candle and paper and ink
Fool I’ll repay you for this favor
Please hurry
This is the air that’s the glorious sun
Where’s Antonio then
I didn’t find him at the Elephant
But he’d been there before me and they told me he’d gone out looking for me
I could really use his advice right now
There’s something going on that’s not what it seems
But here she comes
I’ll follow the priest and go with you and after I’ve sworn to be faithful I’ll be faithful forever
Then lead the way father
If you’re my friend you’ll let me see his letter
Dear Mr Fabian do me another favor first
Anything
Don’t ask to see this letter
My friends are you all Lady Olivia’s servants
Yes sir we’re part of her entourage
I know you
How are you my friend
I’m better off because of my enemies and worse off because of my friends
You’re better off because of your friends
No sir worse off
How can that be
By the way I’m going home tomorrow Sir Toby
What does  You’d have a great hairstyle if you had
Why would that have fixed my hair
Oh no question it won’t style itself
But my hair looks good anyway doesn’t it
It looks great
It hangs like an old worn out mop
Listen I’m going home tomorrow Sir Toby
That duke who lives nearby is courting her
I’ve heard her say that
So cheer up there’s still hope for you man
Well my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot
My enemies help me understand myself better which is an advantage and my friends help me lie about myself which is a disadvantage
So if four negatives make two affirmatives I’m worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes
That’s excellent
Don’t say that unless you want to be one of my friends
That’s a nice hand you dealt me
But if it’s not double dealing sir I wish you’d deal me another
Oh you’re a naughty one encouraging double dealing
Well I’ll commit the sin of double dealing and deal you a second coin
Here it is
And maybe a third
The three beat rhythm is a good for dancing and the church bells chime one two three
You can’t get any more money out of me right now
If you tell your lady I’m here to speak with her and bring her out with you when you come back you might make me more generous
Well then sing a lullaby to your generosity it’ll nap until I come back
But don’t think I’m doing this because I’m greedy
I’ll be back soon to wake up your generosity
Here comes the man who rescued me sir
I remember his face well
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small
Orsino this is the same Antonio who took the
But then he said strange things to me
I don’t know what else it could be
But you’re a famous pirate
Orsino sir please don’t call me those names
I was never a thief or a pirate though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning
He was a wreck almost past hope
I saved his life and gave him my love without reservation
How is that possible
Ah the countess is coming
An angel is walking on earth
What can I give you that you want my lord except the one thing you can’t have
Cesario you missed your appointment with me
Madam
Dearest Olivia  What do you have to say for yourself Cesario My lord please  My lord wants to speak
It’s my duty to be quiet
Are you still so cruel
I am still so faithful my lord
What faithful to being mean and nasty
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered what more am I supposed to do
You can do whatever you want as long as it’s socially appropriate
Come with me boy
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully if it made your life easier
Where’s Cesario going
That’s the truth
Who tricked you
Who treated you badly
Have you completely forgotten
Has it been so long
Call the priest
Go where my lord Cesario my husband stay here
Husband
Yes husband
Can he deny it
Are you her husband boy
No my lord not me
But don’t be afraid Cesario
Be the person you know you are and you’ll be as powerful as this person you fear
Oh hello father
Father could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man
My lord I swear to you  Oh don’t swear
Keep a little bit of honesty even if you’re afraid
For the love of God call a doctor
Sir Toby needs help right away
What’s the matter
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head too
For the love of God help us
I’d give forty pounds to be safe at home right now
Who did this Sir Andrew
The count’s messenger Cesario
We thought he was a coward but he fights like a devil
My Cesario
Anything I did to you I did it because Sir Toby made me
Why are you talking like this
I never hurt you
If a bloody head counts as a hurt then you hurt me
Apparently you think there’s nothing unusual about a bloody head
Here comes Sir Toby limping
He’ll tell you more of the story
If he hadn’t been drunk he would’ve really roughed you up
Hello sir
How are you
It doesn’t matter how I am he hurt me and that’s that
Oh he’s drunk Sir Toby for a whole hour now
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning
Then he’s no good
I hate no good drunks
Take him away
Who did this to him
I’ll help you Sir Toby
Will you help me What an ass and a fool a gullible no good idiot
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated
But please forgive me darling for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently
One face one voice one way of dressing but two people
Antonio oh my dear Antonio
I’ve been so tortured since I lost track of you
Are you Sebastian
Do you have any doubts Antonio
How did you divide yourself in two
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple
Which one is Sebastian
How unbelievable
Sebastian was my father’s name and my brother was named Sebastian too
I am a spirit yes since I have a soul
If you were a woman I’d hug you now and cry and say “Welcome back drowned Viola” My father had a mole on his forehead
Mine did too
He died on Viola’s thirteenth birthday
All right I’ll stay another month
Ah I’m an odd kind of guy
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing
Are you good at those kinds of things
Why do you hide these things
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain
Are they likely to get dusty
Why don’t you go off to church dancing one way and come home dancing another way
I wouldn’t even pee without dancing a waltz
What are you thinking
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments
Look how shapely your legs are
That’s true
Why not
Weren’t we both born under Taurus
Oh I remember that very clearly
It’s true he died on the day my sister turned thirteen
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman’s clothing
The captain who brought me to shore has my women’s clothes
For some reason he’s in prison now on some legal technicality on Malvolio’s orders
He’ll release him
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him
Well he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation
He’s written you a letter
I would’ve given it to you this morning but a madman’s letters aren’t Gospel so it doesn’t matter much if I’m a bit late
Open it and read it
There’s a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman
Why are you talking like that
Are you insane
No madam I’m just reading an insane letter
If you want things done in the right way you’ll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice
No please read it like a sane person
I will my lady but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy
So listen up princess
I swear to God madam you’ve wronged me and I’ll tell the whole world
You’ve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me but I’m as sane as you are
I don’t care what you think of me
I’m going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you’ve caused me
Signed    The poorly treated Malvolio” Did he write this
Yes madam
Set him free
Fabian bring him here
I accept that offer happily madam
Is this the madman
Yes my lord
How are you Malvolio
Madam you’ve treated me badly very badly
I did Malvolio
No
Tell me why you did it
I’m sorry Malvolio but this isn’t my writing though I admit it looks like mine
It’s definitely Maria’s handwriting
Now that I think about it Maria was the one who first told me you were insane
I promise
Well you know “some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them” Anyway I was part of the trick sir
He really was tricked horribly
Go after him and try to calm him down a little
He still hasn’t told us about the captain
Cesario come here
Taurus
That governs the torso and heart doesn’t it
No the legs and thighs
Let me see you dance
He’s only known you for three days but he’s already treating you like a close friend
No not at all
Thanks for telling me
Here comes the Duke now
Has anyone seen Cesario
Be loud and obnoxious
I don’t think so my lord
My boy it’s true
Anyone who says you’re a man must not notice how young you are
I know you’re the right person for this job
I’ll do my best to make this lady love you
Give me too much of it so I’ll get sick of it and stop loving
Oh it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets taking their scent with it
It doesn’t sound as sweet as it did before
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it
Do you want to go hunting my lord
Hunting what Curio
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up
So let her execute me
How do you know
Well he’ll be dead so he won’t see anything
That’s a lame answer
Where good Miss Mary
From soldiers
Well we all have our special gifts
But still she’s going to kill you for being gone so long
You’ve made up your mind then
Well go along now
You’d be the funniest person in Illyria… if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking
Shut up you troublemaker no more of that
Here comes my lady
Get that fool out of here
Didn’t you hear her guys
Get the lady out of here
Oh go away you’re a boring fool
I don’t want to have anything to do with you anymore
Besides you’ve gotten unreliable
If he cannot let the tailor mend him
Anything that’s mended is only patched up
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin
If this logic works that’s great
If not what can you do about it
I told them to take  Oh what a big mistake
Please let me prove you’re a fool
Can you do that
Easily madam
I’ll have to ask you some questions madam
Please answer my good little student
I’m listening to you only because I’ve got nothing better to do
My dear madam why are you in mourning
My dear fool because my brother died
I think his soul’s in hell my lady
I know his soul’s in heaven fool
Then you’re a fool for being sad that your brother’s soul is in heaven
Take away this fool gentlemen
What do you think of this fool Malvolio
Isn’t he getting funnier
Yes and he’ll keep getting funnier till he dies
Old age always makes people act funny even wise people but fools more than anybody
I hope you go senile soon sir so you can become a more foolish fool
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I’m not smart but he wouldn’t bet two cents that you’re not a fool
What do you say to that Malvolio
I’m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker
The other day I saw him defeated in a
I swear anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester’s apprentice
Malvolio your vanity is damaging your good taste
You speak so highly of fools
Madam there’s a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you
Was he sent by Count Orsino
I don’t know madam
He’s a good looking young man and there are a lot of people with him
Who’s talking to him now
Sir Toby madam your relative
He talks nothing but nonsense
If he’s got a message from the count tell him I’m sick or not home
Who’s that at the gate uncle
A gentleman
A gentleman
What gentleman
There’s some gentleman out there  Good Sir Toby
Nonsense
I defy brain death
I told you someone’s at the gate
Yes but who is he
Let him be the devil if he wants to I don’t care
God will protect me
Tell me what a drunk is like fool
He’s a fool a madman and a drowned man
The first drink makes him a fool the second makes him crazy and the third drowns him
Go take care of him
Madam that young man out there says he’s got to speak to you
I told him you were sick
He claimed he knew that and that’s why he’s come to speak with you
I told him you were asleep
He claimed to know that already too and said that’s the reason he’s come to speak with you
What can I say to him lady
He’s got an answer for everything
Tell him he’s not going to speak with me
Just a man like any other
But what’s he like
He insists he’ll speak with you whether you want him to or not
How old is he
Not old enough to be a man but not young enough to be a boy
He’s somewhere between boy and man
He’s very handsome and speaks well but he’s very young
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding
Show him in
Call in my maid
Maria our lady wants you
Give me my veil
Come put it over my face
Which one of you is the lady of the house
You can speak to me
I represent her
What do you want
What stunning exquisite and unmatchable beauty but please tell me if you’re the lady of the house because I’ve never seen her
I’d hate to waste my speech on the wrong person because It’s very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it
Beautiful ladies please don’t treat me badly
I’m very sensitive and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings
Where do you come from sir
I’m sorry but I memorized what I’m supposed to say here today and that question isn’t part of the speech I learned
Please my lady just confirm that you’re the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech
Are you an actor
No madam
But I swear I’m not the person I’m playing
Are you the lady of the house
I am unless I somehow stole this role
If you’re the lady of the house then it’s true you’re stealing your role because what’s yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself
But that’s not part of what I’m supposed to say
I’ll go on with my speech praising you and then I’ll get to the point
Get to the point now
I’ll let you get away with skipping the praise
That’s too bad because I spent a long time memorizing it and it’s poetic
That means it’s more likely to be fake
Please keep it to yourself
If you’re just insane then get out of here
Ready to set sail sir
The door’s right here
Tell me what you want
Tell me what it’s about
It’s about you
I’m not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash
I’m coming in peace
But you began so rudely
Who are you
What do you want
What’s going on
What have you heard from her
Take me to the garden
Who I am and what I want are a secret
Everyone please leave us alone for a moment
Most sweet lady  Oh “sweet”
Where’s the passage of holy scripture that you’re basing your sermon on
In Orsino’s heart
In his heart
In what chapter and verse of his heart
The table of contents says it’s in the first chapter of his heart
Oh I’ve read that
That’s not holy it’s heresy
Do you have anything else to say
Madam please let me see your face
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face
You’re overstepping your bounds now
But I’ll open the curtain and let you see the picture
Look sir this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment
It’s pretty well done isn’t it
Wind and rain can’t wash it off
Oh I’d never be that cruel
I’ll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part
But you’d still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil
My lord loves you
How does he love me
Your lord knows what I think
I can’t love him
I know he’s noble rich young and with a fine reputation
People say he’s generous well educated and brave and he’s very attractive
But I just can’t love him
What would you do about it
From that cabin I’d call out to my soul
I’d write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night
Not bad you might accomplish something
But I’m still fairly high ranking
I’m a gentleman
Go back to your lord
I can’t love him
Tell him not to send any more messengers unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news
Goodbye
Thanks for your trouble
Here’s some money for you
I’m not a paid messenger my lady
Keep your money
It’s my master who’s not getting the reward he deserves not me
Goodbye you beautiful cruel woman
But I’m still fairly high ranking
Ah no
Calm down calm down
If only his lord were more like him
How strange I’m feeling
Can someone fall in love this quickly
Come here
At your service madam
Run after that obnoxious messenger the duke’s servant
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not
Madam I will
I don’t know what I’m doing
Fate do your work
We human beings don’t control our own destinies
What is fated to happen must happen
No I’d rather you stayed here
At least tell me where you’re going
Honestly I can’t
I’m just wandering with no particular destination
But I know you’d never force me to tell you things I don’t want to so I should be polite and tell you what I can
He left behind myself and my twin sister who was born in the same hour as me
If God had been willing I wish we had died in the same hour too
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves my sister drowned
How tragic
Although many people said she looked like me she was considered beautiful
She’s been drowned in salty sea water and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again
Oh Antonio I’m sorry I caused you so much trouble
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you
I like you very much
I’m going to Count Orsino’s court
Goodbye
I wish you all the best
If I didn’t have so many enemies in Orsino’s court I’d go join you there
But who cares
Excuse me weren’t you with Countess Olivia just now
Yes sir
I’ve only made it this far since I left her place walking at a moderate pace
She’s sending this ring back to you sir
You should’ve saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself
Here take the ring
She took that ring from me
I won’t take it back
You threw it at her rudely and she wants you to take it back
I didn’t give her any ring
What’s she trying to say
I hope she doesn’t have a crush on me
It’s true she looked at me a lot in fact she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted and couldn’t really finish her sentences very well
Oh I really think she loves me
creet
I’m the man she wants
If that’s true which it is she might as well be in love with a dream the poor lady
Ah how will this all turn out
What can possibly fix this situation
Oh only time can sort out this mess
I can’t figure it out by myself
Come on Sir Andrew
And the doctors say it’s healthy to get up early  I don’t know what the doctors say
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late
A false conclusion
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup
You’re a smart guy
So we should eat and drink
Maria
Bring us some wine
Look here comes the fool
Hello my friends
What a pretty picture three fools all together
Hello you idiot
Sing us a song
What country is this friends
This is Illyria lady
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria
My brother is in heaven
Or maybe there’s a chance he didn’t drown What do you think sailors
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved
Oh my poor brother
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too
It’s possible ma'am
Don’t give up yet
I was born and raised less than three hours from here
I swear this fool has an excellent singing voice
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands and great warriors aren’t  Ha ha
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life
A love song a love song
Yes yes
I’m not interested in being good
That was excellent really excellent
Good very good
A beautiful voice I swear
His breath stinks
Yes it stinks very sweetly
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl
Should we do that
Let’s go for it
Absolutely
Let’s dance to “You Jerk” You mean “Shut up you jerk”
So I’ll be forced to call you a jerk Sir Andrew
It starts “Shut up” I’ll never be able to start if I shut up
That’s true
But come on start
You’re making a terrible racket out here
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house
For God’s sake shut up
Are you all crazy
What’s wrong with you
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners or because you’re just stupid
Don’t you have any respect for anything
We respected the beat of the song sir
So shut up
Sir Toby I’ve got to be frank with you
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you’re a relative she doesn’t approve of your behavior
If you can shape up you’re welcome to stay in the house
If you can’t and would prefer to leave she’s very willing to say goodbye to you
No good Sir Toby
That’s out of tune sir
You lie
They certainly will
You’re right
Go and wiggle your ears
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up
Do that
I’ll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf
Or I’ll deliver your insults to his face
Dear Sir Toby don’t do anything rash tonight
Ever since the Duke’s messenger visited Olivia she’s been upset
As for Monsieur Malvolio let me take care of him
I know I can do it
Oh I’ll beat him up for that
I don’t have any “brilliant” reason for it but I have a good enough reason
That’s the weakness I’ll use to get revenge on him
What are you going to do
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia’s she
Excellent
I like it too
He’ll think these letters are from Olivia and that she’s in love with him
Yes that’s the idea
He’s going to look like a total idiot
Absolutely you idiot
This is going to be great
It’s going to be fun I promise
I know my medicine will work on him
I’ll have you two hide and the fool too right where he’ll find the letter
Watch his reaction
Meanwhile let’s go to bed and dream about this
Good night
Good night you amazing woman you
She’s a fine woman all right
She’s a good little woman and she adores me
What about it
Someone adored me once too
Let’s go to bed knight
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you
I know I will too if it’s the last thing I do
It’s too late to go to bed now
Play me some music
Sir the person who should sing that song isn’t here
Who was it
He’s somewhere else in the house
You’re absolutely right
I’d bet my life that as young as you are you’ve fallen in love with someone
Haven’t you boy
A little bit
What kind of woman is she
She’s a lot like you
She’s not good enough for you then
How old is she
About as old as you are my lord
That’s definitely too old
A woman should always pick an older man
I think you’re right sir
So find someone younger to love or you won’t be able to maintain your feelings
Women are like roses the moment their beauty is in full bloom it’s about to decay
That’s true
It’s too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection
Who’s the ruler here
A duke who is noble in name and character
What’s his name
Orsino
Orsino
I’ve heard my father mention him
When I first heard about him he was still a bachelor
But there was a rumor you know people always gossip about royalty that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia
Who’s she
I wish I could work for that lady
Are you ready sir
No trouble sir
I like singing
Then I’ll pay you for doing what you like
You may leave
Goodbye
All the rest of you can leave too
Cesario go visit that cruel Olivia one more time
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world and has nothing to do with her property
But if she can’t love you sir
I refuse to accept that
But you have to
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia
Shouldn’t she just accept that
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel
No woman’s heart is big enough to hold all my love
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea
It’s as all consuming and insatiable as the sea and it can swallow as much as the sea can
Don’t compare a woman’s love for a man with my love for Olivia
Yes but I know  What do you know
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men
Actually their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you if I were a woman
And what’s her story
There was no story my lord
Doesn’t that sound like true love
But did your sister die of love
I am the only daughter in my father’s family and all the brothers too but I’m not completely sure about that
Anyway sir should I go see the lady
Come along with us Signor Fabian
I’m coming don’t worry
If I miss this let me be boiled alive
Won’t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated
I’ll be thrilled
You know he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear baiting here
We’ll have another bear baiting just to make him angry and we’ll mock him till he’s black and blue
Won’t we Sir Andrew
If we don’t it’ll be the biggest disappointment of our lives
Here comes the little villain herself
How are you my golden girl
Hide behind the boxwood hedge all three of you
Malvolio’s coming down the path
He’s been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour
This letter’s going to turn him into a starry eyed idiot
Who's there
No answer me
Halt and identify yourself
Long live the king
Bernardo
Yes
You’re really on time
It’s just midnight
Go to bed Francisco
Thanks for being on time
It’s bitter cold And I’m depressed
Have things been quiet on your watch
Not a mouse stirring
Well good night
If you meet Horatio and Marcellus The ones who will watch with me tell them to hurry up
I think I hear them
Halt
Who goes there
Your friends
And subjects of the Dane
Have a good night
Bernardo
Have a good night
What is that Horatio with you
A piece of him
Welcome Horatio
Welcome good Marcellus
Tell me has this thing appeared again tonight
I haven’t seen anything
Horatio says it’s all in our imagination And doesn’t believe a word we say About this dreaded sight seen twice by us
So I’ve begged him to come along With us to watch what happens this night That if this apparition comes again He may believe what we have seen and speak to it
Nonsense nonsense it will not appear
Sit down awhile And let us tell you once again You who is so stubborn in not believing our story What we have seen these last two nights
OK let’s sit down And listen to Bernardo speak of this
Last night When that star up there that's west of the North Pole Had moved around to light that part of the sky Where now it burns Marcellus and myself The clock’s bell then tolling one Quiet stop
Look it’s coming again
It looks just like the dead king
You’re a scholar speak to it Horatio
Doesn’t it look like the King
Look at it Horatio
Yes it does
It fills me with fear and wonder
It wants to be spoken to
Question it Horatio
What are you that seizes this time of night Taking the same fair and warlike form In which the dead king of Denmark now buried Did sometimes march
By heaven I order you speak
It is offended
See it stalks away
Stay
speak speak
I order you to speak
It is gone and will not answer us
What’s wrong Horatio
You tremble and look pale
Is this not more than our imaginations
What do you think about it
Before my God I might not believe this thing Without the seeing and true testimony Of my own eyes
Isn’t it like the King
As you are to yourself
It is strange
It’s come twice before and just appearing out of nothing he’s gone past us at this dead hour with a warlike stalk
I don’t know what its intentions are But in the plainness and freedom of my opinion This foretells some strange eruption to our state
Who is the man who can explain this to me
I can explain it At least what’s on the grapevine
I think it can be no other reason but that
Well it may turn out that this warning figure Comes armed through our watch looking so like the king That was and is the question of these wars
It is a speck of dust to irritate the mind's eye
In the most high and palm tree like state of Rome A little before the mightiest Julius Caesar was killed The graves had no bodies and the dead in sheets Squeaked and gibbered in the Roman streets And stars with trains of fire and red morning dews Disasters in the sun
And like similar forecasters of fierce events As the advance team before the fates And prologue to the omen coming on Heaven and earth have together demonstrated To our country and countrymen
Look where it comes again
I’ll cross it though it kill me
Stay illusion
stay and speak
Stop it Marcellus
Shall I strike at it with my club
Go ahead if it will not stand
It is here
It is here
It is gone
We do it wrong its being so like the king To offer it the show of violence Because it is like the air unable to be hurt And our empty blows seem like a malicious joke
It was about to speak when the rooster crowed
And then it seemed startled like a guilty thing Running from a court order
I have heard The rooster that is the trumpet of the morning With his lofty and shrill sounding throat Awakes the god of day and at his warning Whether in sea or fire in earth or air The straying and wandering spirit hurries back To his grave
It faded on the crowing of the rooster
I’ve heard that too and partly believe it
But look the morning dressed in a red cape Walks over the dew of that high hill in the east
Let’s break up our watch and I think We should tell all we have seen tonight To young Hamlet for I swear on my life This spirit silent to us will speak to him
Do you agree that we shall tell him Because we love him and it is our duty
Let's do it I beg you and I know exactly Where we shall easily find him
We have not disregarded Your good advice which has freely gone Along with this affair
To all our thanks
I will tell you now as you know young Fortinbras Not thinking very much of us Or thinking that our late dear brother's death Made our country disorganized and no longer powerful Conspiring with this dream of his advantage Has not failed to pester us with messages Asking us to the surrender of those lands Lost by his father within all the rules of law To our most valiant brother
So much for him
Now what we have done so far Is this
we have here written To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras Who impotent and bed rid knows nothing Of his nephew's intentions to stop His further progress in this plan because the levies The lists and full proportions are all made Without his knowledge and we are sending You good Cornelius and you Voltimand To take this greeting to old Norway Without giving you any further personal power To do business with the king more than the scope Of these detailed items allow
Farewell and hurry to do your duty
In that and all things we will show our duty
We do not doubt it
Heartily farewell
And now Laertes what's the news with you
You told us you want something
What is it Laertes
You cannot start to ask the King of Denmark And then stop
What do you want Laertes That I shall not my offer before you ask
The head is not more native to the heart The hand more instrumental to the mouth Than is the throne of Denmark to your father
What would you ask Laertes
Have you your father's permission
What says Polonius
My lord he has wrung from me my reluctant permission By asking me again and again and I Finally had to give in
I do beg you give him permission to go
How is it that the clouds still hang on you
That’s not so my lord I am too much in the sun
Good Hamlet take off your black looks And let your eye look on the King like a friend
Don’t look for your noble father on the ground Forever with sad eyes
Yes madam that’s the way it goes
If that’s the way it goes Why does it seem unusual with you
Seem” madam
No it is
For shame
It is a sin to heaven A sin against the dead a sin to nature Most ridiculous to reason whose common theme Is death of fathers and who still has cried From the first corpse to the man who died just today ”This must be so” We beg you give up on This unusual grief and think of us As of a father
Because let the whole world know You are the next in line to our throne And I give you my love with no less nobility Than the love which the dearest father Bears his son
As for your intentions To go back to school in Wittenberg Leaving here is not something that we want And we beg you to give into remaining Here in the happiness and pleasure of our eyes Our most important courtier cousin and our son
Don’t let my prayers go unanswered Hamlet
I beg you to stay with us don’t go to Wittenberg
I’ll do my best to obey you madam
Why it is a loving and a fair reply
Behave as we would in Denmark
Let’s go
O God
O God
How weary stale flat and unprofitable All the habits of this world seem to me
Shame on it
O for shame
It is an unweeded garden That is going to seed only things that are decaying and Disgusting grow there
That it should come to this
Only dead for two months
Heaven and earth
Must I remember
Weakness your name is woman   A little month even before those shoes with which she Followed my poor father's body were old she was Totally inconsolable all tears why she even she  O God
a beast that lacks the gift of reason Would have mourned longer  married my uncle My father's brother but no more like my father Than I am like Hercules
Within a month Before the salt of the most wicked tears Had left the redness in her bitter eyes She married
O most wicked speed to travel With such quickness to incestuous sheets
It is not good and it cannot come to good
But break my heart for I must be silent
Greetings to your lordship
I am glad to see you well
Or I do forget myself
It’s me my lord and your poor servant forever
And why are you here from Wittenberg Horatio
A lazy disposition my good lord
I wouldn’t even hear your enemy say so And you shall not violently throw those words to my ear To make my ear the keeper of your own report Against yourself
I know you are not lazy
But what are you doing in Elsinore
We'll teach you to drink a lot before you leave
My lord I came to see your father's funeral
Please don’t mock me fellow student
I think it was to see my mother's wedding
Indeed my lord it followed very soon after
Thrift thrift Horatio
The meats baked for the funeral Were also put on the marriage tables
I wish I had met my dearest enemy in heaven Before I had ever seen that day Horatio
My father… I think I see my father
Where my lord
In my mind's eye Horatio
He was a man take him for all in all I shall not look upon his like again
My lord I think I saw him last night
My lord the king your father
The King my father
Hold off your compliments for awhile And pay attention until I may deliver With the witness of these gentlemen Something marvelous to you
For God's love let me hear what you have to say
But where was this
My lord on the platform where we watched
Didn’t you speak to it
My lord I did But it made me no answer
It is very strange
I swear my honored lord it is true And we thought it was our duty To let you know about it
Are you going to watch again tonight
We are my lord
He was armed you say
Armed my lord
From top to toe
My lord from head to foot
Then you didn’t see his face
O yes my lord
He had the front visor of his helmet up
What did he look like he was frowning
His face showed more sorrow than anger
Was he pale or red
No very pale
And he fixed his eyes on you
Most constantly
I wish I had been there
It would have amazed you very much
I’m sure it would’ve I’m sure it would’ve
Did it stay long
As long as an average person might count to a hundred
Longer longer
Not when I saw it
His beard was grizzly no
It was as I have seen it in his life A silvery sable
I guarantee it will
If it takes on my noble father's appearance I’ll speak to it though hell itself should open wide And order me to be silent
I beg you all If you have kept this sight secret so far Keep your silence still And whatever else shall happen tonight Take it in but don’t talk about it
I will reward your loyalty
So goodbye for now
On the platform between eleven and twelve I’ll visit you
Our duty to your honor
Your loyalty as mine to you
Goodbye
My father's spirit in arms
I wish the night were here now
Until then sit still my soul
Wicked deeds will rise to be Seen even if they are buried very deep in the earth
The things I need are all on the ship
Goodbye
And sister as the winds will be favorable And the ships are strong to sail don’t sleep Until you let me hear from you
Do you doubt that
As for Hamlet and the foolishness of his attentions Think that it is only a phase and a toy in blood
Nothing more than that
Stop thinking about it Because nature the moon does not grow alone In strength and size but as this temple grows The inward duty of the mind and soul Grows wide along with the rest
He may not as lower persons do Select for himself for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state And therefore must his choice be subject To the voice and consent of that state That he is the head of
Then if he says he loves you You would be wise to believe it Because then being in his particular act and place May do what he says which is what The majority of people in of Denmark go along with
So decide what loss your honor may receive If you listen to his songs with a too believing ear Or lose your heart or lose your virginity To his wild sense of bad timing
Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister And keep your affections deep within you Out of the range and danger of desire
The most careful maid is wasteful enough If she unmasks her beauty to the moon
Virtue itself doesn’t aim at lying deeds
An ugly disease afflicts the new flowers of the spring Too often before they have bloomed And in the morning and liquid dew of youth Contagious shriveling is the most imminent
Youth rebels against itself even if no one else is near
I shall keep the purpose of this good lesson As watchman to my heart
But my good brother Don’t as some insincere ministers do Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven While like a proud and reckless wild man Preaches against the primrose path of sin And does not practice what he preaches
O don’t be afraid of me
I’ve stayed too long
But here comes my father
A double blessing is a double grace It’s a better occasion to smile at saying goodbye again
You’re still here Laertes
Aboard aboard for shame
The wind sits in the best part of your sail And the ship waits for you
There my blessing with you
And see that you write these few precepts In your memory
Give your thoughts to yourself And don’t act without thinking
Be friendly but by no means vulgar
Those friends you have and their friendship tested Anchor them to your soul with hoops of steel But don’t spend your money on entertaining Each newly acquired unproven friend
Beware Of getting into a quarrel but once you are in Fight so that the man you fight with may beware of you
This above all to your own self be true And it must follow as the night the day You cannot then be false to any man
Goodbye
My blessing instill these things in you
I take my leave most humbly my lord
Goodbye Ophelia and remember well What I have said to you
It is locked in my memory And you yourself shall keep the key of it
Goodbye
What is it Ophelia that he has said to you
If it pleases you something touching the Lord Hamlet
By Mary well thought
What is going on between you
Tell me the truth
My lord he has of late made many offers Of his affection to me
Affection
Pooh
You speak like a green girl Ignorant in such dangerous circumstances
Do you believe his “offers” as you call them
My lord I don’t know what I should think
By Mary I’ll teach you
Think that you are a baby That you have taken these offers for true love Which are not true offers
Consider yourself more dearly Or not to keep harping on that poor phrase Doing harm to it you'll “offer” me a fool
My lord he has courted me with love In honorable fashion
And has given proper appearance to his speech my lord With almost all the holy vows of heaven
Yes mousetraps to catch fools
I do know When passion burns the blood how the wasteful soul Gives the tongue vows to speak
These blazes daughter Giving more light than heat dead in both Even in their promises dying as they are being made Must not be taken for real fire
As for Lord Hamlet Only believe so much about him that he is young And he may walk on a higher mountain Than may be given you
In short Ophelia Don’t believe his vows because they are pimps Not made of those things which show outside But mere beggars of unholy courtships Breathing like holy and righteous procurers The better to deceive you
Do as I say I order you
Let’s go
I shall obey my lord
The air bites sharply It is very cold
It is a nipping and an eager air
What time is it now
I think it’s just before twelve
No the clock has already struck twelve
Indeed
I didn’t hear it
Then it’s getting close to the time When the spirit has his habit of walking
What does that mean my lord
The King stays awake tonight and has a drinking party Keeps toasting and the swaggering morning whirls And as he drinks down his drafts of Rhine wine The kettle drum and trumpet thus noisily announce The triumph of his drinking it all down at once
Is it a custom
Yes by Mary it is But to my mind though I am a native here And know the customs since birth it is a custom More honored in the braking it than the observing it
So often it might happen in particular men That for some vicious disfigurement of nature in them Like a birthmark  something they are not guilty of Because a man cannot choose how he is born  By the overdevelopment of some temperament That often defies the intelligent use of reason Or by some habit that too much exceeds The limits of acceptable behavior that these men Carrying I say the stamp of one defect Being the result of nature or a star of fortune Whatever other virtues they have even if they are As pure as grace as infinite as men may have Shall in the general opinion be labeled corrupt From that one particular fault
The drop of affliction Often causes doubt about all the virtues they have To men’s own disgrace
Look my lord it comes
Angels and ministers of grace defend us
Whether you are a spirit of health or a goblin damned Bringing with you airs from heaven or blasts from hell Whether your intentions are wicked or charitable You come in such a questionable shape That I will speak to you
O answer me
Don’t let me burst in ignorance but tell me Why your sacred bones buried in death Have escaped from the cemetery why the tomb Wherein we saw you quietly laid to rest Has opened his frightening and marble jaws To bring you back to life
What does this mean That you dead corpse again in full armor Revisit us in the light and shadows of the moon Making night hideous and making us fools of nature Shake our dispositions so horridly With thoughts that go beyond the reaches of our souls
Say why is this
Why
What should we do
It beckons you to go away with it As if it had something to say To you alone
Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more private ground
But don’t go with it
No by no means
If it will not speak then I will follow it
Don’t my lord
Why what should I be afraid of
I don’t value my life at the price of a pin And as for my soul what can it do to that Being a thing that is immortal as it is
It waves me forward again
I’ll follow it
What if it tempts you toward the ocean my lord Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That hangs so threateningly over his base into the sea And once there assumes some other horrible form Which might deprive you of the ability to think And draw you into madness
Think about it
The very place puts desperate ideas Without any motive into every brain That looks so many fathoms into the sea And hears it roar beneath
It waves me still
Go on I’ll follow you
You shall not go my lord
Hold off your hands
Listen to me you shall not go
My fate cries out And makes each and every vein in this body As hardy as the nerve of the lion killed by Hercules
By heaven I’ll make a ghost of him that holds me back
I say get away from me
He’s getting crazy with expectation
Let’s do it
What will all this lead to
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
Heaven will guide its course
No let's follow him
Where will you lead me
Speak
I’ll go no further
Listen to me
I will
Don’t pity me but listen seriously To what I shall disclose to you
Speak I am obliged to listen
So you are obliged to revenge when you shall hear me
What
I am your father's spirit Doomed for a certain time to walk the night And during the day I am confined to burn in fires Until the evil crimes I had done in my life Are burnt and purged away
If I were not forbidden To tell the secrets of my prison house I could tell a tale whose lightest word Would crush your soul freeze your young blood Make your two eyes like stars jump from their sockets Your knotted and combined hair to separate And each particular hair to stand on end Like quills on the angry porcupine
But this eternal description must not be given To ears of flesh and blood
Listen listen O listen
If you ever loved your dear father   O God
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
Murder
Murder most foul as even at best it is still murder But this murder is the most foul strange and unnatural
Tell me about it quickly so that I with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love May rush to my revenge
I find you ready And if you were duller than the fat weed That rots itself in ease on the river bank You wouldn’t move on this
Now Hamlet listen
The story goes that sleeping in my orchard A serpent bit me
O my prophetic soul
My uncle
O Hamlet what a falling off there was in our marriage
But as virtue can never be moved it Was courted though lewdness in a shape of heaven And lust though linked to a radiant angel Will satisfy itself in a heavenly bed And eat garbage
But wait
O horrible
O horrible
Most horrible
But however you pursue this revenge Don’t taint your mind or let your soul plan Anything against your mother
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that live in her bosom To prick and sting her
Goodbye now
The glowworm shows the morning is near And he begins to put out his ineffective fire
Goodbye goodbye
Hamlet remember me
O all you host of heaven
O earth
what else
And shall I join forces hell
O for shame
Remember you
Yes you poor ghost while memory holds a seat In this confused world
Remember you
Yes from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all unimportant records All kinds of books all pictures all pressures past That my youth and observations wrote there And your commandment all by itself shall live Within the book and volume of my brain Unmixed with other low thoughts
Yes by heaven
O most pernicious woman
O villain villain smiling damned villain
My papers it is just that I set it all down That one may smile and smile and be a villain At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark
So uncle there you are
Now to my word It is Goodbye goodbye
remember me
I have sworn it
So be it
Hello ho ho my lord
Hello ho ho boy
Come bird come
How are you my noble lord
What news my lord
O wonderful
My good lord tell it
No you'll reveal it
Not I my lord by heaven
Nor I my lord
What do you say then would heart of man once think it
And you'll keep it secret
Yes by heaven my lord
There's never a villain dwelling in all Denmark Except that he's an arrant knave
We don’t need a ghost my lord to come from the grave To tell us this
These are but wild and whirling words my lord
I’m sorry they offend you heartily Yes indeed heartily
There's no offense my lord
Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio And much offense too
Regarding this vision here It is an honest ghost that I can tell you
As for your desire to know what happened between us Control it the best you can
And now good friends As you are friends scholars and soldiers Give me one poor request
What is it my lord
We will
Never make known what you have seen tonight
My lord we will not
No but swear it
Really My lord I would not
Nor I my lord really
Swear on my sword
We have sworn my lord already
Indeed on my sword indeed
Swear
Are you there trusty fellow
Come on
Tell us the oath my lord
Swear
You are everywhere
then we'll move our ground
Come over here gentlemen And lay your hands again on my sword
Never to speak of what you have heard Swear by my sword
Swear
Well said old mole
Can you work in the earth so fast
A worthy pioneer
Once more leave good friends
O day and night but this is wondrous strange
And therefore as a stranger welcome it
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio Than are dreamt of in your philosophy
Swear
Rest rest irritated spirit
Let’s go in together And still keeping your silence I beg you
The time is so out of whack
O cursed spite That ever I was born to set it right
No come let's go together
Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo
I will my lord
You would do very well good Reynaldo Before you visit him to ask someone About his behavior
My lord I did intend to ask
By Mary well said very well said
Look here sir First ask what Danes are in Paris And how and who what means and where they live What company at what expense and finding By this talking around and drift of questions That they who do know my son come nearer to you Than your particular questions will touch it
Assume as it were that you have only heard about him Such as “I know his father and his friends And in part him” are you listening to me Reynaldo
Yes very well my lord
And in part him but” you may say “not very well
As gaming my lord
Yes or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling Prostitution
You may go that far
My lord that would dishonor him
Just as you mention it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him That he is open to inconstancy
Just tell his faults so quaintly That they may seem to be the stains of freedom The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind A savageness in wild blood An attack that everyone goes through
But my good lord Why should you do this
Yes my lord I want to know that
By Mary sir here's my intention And I believe it is a trick of protection
And then sir ask if he does this does he  What was I about to say
So using my lecture and advice from before You shall check on my son
You understand me yes
My lord I do
My good lord
Observe his inclinations in yourself
I shall my lord
And let him practice his music
Well my lord
Goodbye
Alas my lord I have been so frightened
By what in the name of God
My lord as I was sewing in my chamber Lord Hamlet with his shirt all unbuttoned No hat upon his head his stockings dirty Not pulled up and fallen down around his ankles Pale as his shirt his knees knocking together And with a look so pitiful in its meaning As if he had been freed out of hell To speak of horrors he comes before me
Crazy for your love
My lord I don’t know But I truly fear it
What did he say
He took me by the wrist and held me hard Then he went to the length of his whole arm And with his other hand like this over his brow He started such study of my face As though he wanted to draw it
Come go with me
I will look for the king
This is the very passion of love Whose violent property kills itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As often as any passion under heaven That afflicts our natures
No my good lord but as you did command I did reject his letters and denied His access to me
That has made him crazy
I am sorry that I didn’t treat him with better heed and Judgment
I was afraid he was only trifling with you And meant to wreck you but curse my jealousy
It seems it is as proper for our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion
Come let’s go to the king
This must be known which if kept secret might mean More trouble to hide it than hate for utter love
Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
In addition to the fact that we have wanted to see you for A long time the reason we need to see you made us Send our hasty invitation
What the problem should be More than his father's death that has put him So much from the understanding of himself I cannot dream of
I beg you both That being childhood friends and brought up with him And since you know well his youth and disposition That you will be pleased to rest here in our court For a while so that with your company you Draw him on to enjoy himself and to gather So much as from any occasion you may glean Whether anything unknown to us afflicts him like this That once we know we can make better
Good gentlemen he has much talked of you And I am sure that there are not living two men With whom he feels close
If you will please Show us so much gentry and goodwill As to spend your time with us a while To help us find out what is troubling him Your visit shall receive such thanks As only a King can give
Both your majesties Might by the sovereign power you have of us Put your huge request more into a command Than to an entreaty
We both obey And here we give up ourselves without reservation To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded
Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern
Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz
And I beg you instantly to visit My too much changed son
Go some of you And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is
May the heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him
Yes amen
The ambassadors from Norway my good lord Are joyfully returned
You have always been the father of good news
Have I my lord
I assure you my good lord I believe my duty is as I believe in my soul Both to my God and to my gracious king
And I do think  or else this brain of mine Doesn’t know the trail of policy as surely As it used to do  that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy
Introduce yourself to them and bring them in
He tells me my sweet queen he has found The head and source of all your son's unhappiness
I doubt it is none other than the main reason His father's death and our overly hasty marriage
Well we shall figure him out
Welcome my good friends
Say Voltimand what news from our ally Norway
We really like this news And later when we have more time we'll read this Request answer and think upon this business
In the meantime we thank you for a job well done
Get some rest tonight we'll feast together
A great welcome home
This business is well ended
Crazy” I call it because to define true craziness What is it except to be nothing else but crazy
But ignore that
Madam I swear I use no clever words at all
It remains like this and the remainder like this
Consider
I have a daughter have while she is mine Who in her duty and obedience listen Has given me this
Now listen and understand
You may doubt you that the stars are fire ”You may doubt that the sun does move ”You may doubt truth to be a liar ”But never doubt I love
O dear Ophelia I am sick at the number of my sighs I don’t have the skill to calculate my groans
but that I love you best O most best believe it
Adieu
Yours evermore most dear lady while this brain is in him HAMLET
This my daughter has shown this to me in obedience And furthermore has his gifts Which she has described to me by the time by means and place they were received
But how has she Received his love
What do you think of me
As of a man faithful and honorable
I would gladly prove so
Do you think it is this
It may be very likely
Has there been such a time I’d gladly know that That I have positively said “it is so” And it wasn’t
Not that I know of
Take this from this if this isn’t the case now
If get the opportunity I will find Where truth is hidden though it were hidden indeed Within the centre of the man
How can we find out more
You know sometimes he walks for hours and hours Here in the lobby
So he does indeed
At such a time I’ll make sure my daughter meets him
You and I will be behind a curtain then Listening to their encounter
If he doesn’t love her And he’s not gone crazy because of love Let me be no assistant for a state But be a farmer and horse carter
We will try it
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
O give me permission
How does my good Lord Hamlet
Well God have mercy
Do you know me my lord
Not I my lord
Then I wish you were so honest a man
Honest my lord
That's very true my lord
For if the sun breeds maggots in a dead dog being a god kissing rotten flesh  Have you a daughter
I have my lord
Let her not walk in the sun
Pregnancy is a blessing but not as your daughter may get pregnant
Friend look to it
How say you by that
Still harping on my daughter
He is far gone far gone
In my youth I truly suffered much agony for love almost like this
Words words words
What is the matter my lord
Between who
I mean the matter that you are reading my lord
all of which sir although I believe it most powerfully and potently yet I think it was dishonest to have written it like this because you yourself sir should be old as I am if like a crab you could go backward
Into my grave
Indeed that is out of the air
Aside
How full of meaning his replies sometimes are
A happiness that often craziness hits on which reason and sanity couldn’t arranged so happily
You cannot sir take from me anything that I will more willingly part with except my life except my life except my life
Goodbye my lord
These tedious old fools
God save you sir
My honored lord
My most dear lord
My excellent good friends
How are you Guildenstern
Ah Rosencrantz
Good lads how do you both
As the indifferent children of the earth
Nor the soles of her shoe
Neither my lord
Then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favors
God we are her privates
In the secret parts of fortune
What's the news
None my lord but that the world's grown honest
Prison my lord
Denmark's a prison
Then the world is one
A goodly one in which there are many cells wards and dungeons Denmark being one of the worst
We don’t think so my lord
Why then it is not a prison to you for there is nothing either good or bad but only thinking makes it so
To me it is a prison
O God I could be put into a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space if it were not that I have bad dreams
Those dreams are indeed ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
A dream itself is but a shadow
Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow
Then our beggars are bodies and our monarchs and outstretched heroes are the beggars' shadows
Shall we to the court
for by my faith I cannot reason
We'll wait upon you
That’s not necessary
I won’t sort you with the rest of my servants because to speak to you like an honest man I am most dreadfully attended
But in the beaten way of friendship what are you doing at Elsinore
To visit you my lord no other occasion
Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are a halfpenny too expensive
Weren’t you sent for
Is it your own desire to come here
Is it a free visit
Come on Tell me the truth
What should we say my lord
Why anything but to the answer
You were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which you are not very good at hiding
I know the good king and queen have sent for you
What for my lord
You have to tell me
But let me beg you by the rights of our fellowship by the harmony of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by anything else that could charge you to be even and direct with me were you were sent for or not
What do you say
My lord we were sent for
I have of late but why I don’t know lost all my joy given up all habits of exercises and indeed I am so depressed that this good frame the earth seems to me to be a sterile outpost this most excellent canopy the air  look  this brave sky hanging over us this majestic roof divided with golden fire why it seems to me to be nothing but a dirty and disgusting meeting of vapors
What a piece of work is man
How noble in reason
how infinite in faculties
in form and moving how expressive and admirable
In action how like an angel
in understanding how like a god
And yet to me what is this highly refined speck of dust
Man doesn’t delight me no nor woman either though by your smiling you seem to find that funny
My lord there wasn’t any such stuff in my thoughts
Why did you laugh then when I said “Man doesn’t delight me”
To think my lord if you do not delight in man what a somber reception the players shall receive from you
We passed them on the way and they are coming here to perform
What players are they
Even those you usually enjoy the tragedians of the city
How is it that they travel
Being in the city was better for them in regards to their reputation and their profits
I think their traveling to perform a play is a new innovation
Do they hold the same respect they did when I was in the city
Are they still followed
No indeed they are not
Why
Do they grow rusty
No their work keeps them at their usual pace but there is sir a brood of children untrained that complicate their situation and are most tyrannically beaten for it
Children are now very popular and are on the common stages as they call them so much that many actors are afraid they cannot compete and barely dare to come there
What are they children
Who cares for them
Where do they live
Will they stop pursuing the stage when they can no longer sing
Won’t they say later if they should go on to become common players which is likely and their lives are no better that their writers did them wrong to make them exclaim against their own success
Well there has been a lot of comment on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to provoke them to controversy
There was for a while no money paid for debate unless the poet and the player fought over the question
Is it possible
O there has been a lot of bashing of brains going on
Do the boys carry them away
Yes they do my lord Hercules and his load too
It is not very strange for my uncle is king of Denmark and those that would make faces at him while my father lived paid twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats each for a little picture of him
God’s blood there is something more than natural in this if philosophy could figure it out
There are the players
Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore
Let me shake your hands
The accessory of a welcome is fashion and ceremony
Let me comply with it in these clothes for fear that my welcome to the players which I tell you must look good should more appear like entertainment than your plays
You are welcome
but my uncle father and aunt  mother are deceived
In what my dear lord
I am but crazy north north west
When the wind is from the south I know a hawk from a handsaw
Welcome gentlemen
Listen Guildenstern and you too with each ear
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clothes
Happily this is the second time he uses them for they say an old man is twice a child
I predict he comes to tell me of the players listen
You say right sir
On Monday morning it was true indeed
Buzz buzz
Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus too light
For the law of writ and the liberty these are the only men
O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure you had
What treasure did he have my lord
Why“One fair daughter and no more The which he loved passing well” Still harping on my daughter
Am I not in the right old Jephthah
If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I love passing well
No that doesn’t follow
What follows then my lord
Why “As by lot God knows” and then you know”It came to pass as most like it was” The first line of the holy song will show you more for look where my means of whiling away the time comes
You are welcome masters welcome all
I am glad to see you well
Welcome good friends
What my young lady and mistress
By our lady your ladyship is taller than when I saw you last by the height of a high heeled shoe
Pray God your voice like a an unused gold coin can’t be cracked within the ring
Masters you are all welcome
We'll act up like French falconers fly at anything we see
We'll have a speech right now
Come give us a bit of your quality
Come a passionate speech
What speech my lord
I heard you do a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not more than once for the play I remember didn’t please the crowd it was caviar to the particular but it was as I took it and others whose judgments in such matters far exceed mine an excellent play well organized in the scenes set down with as much modesty as skill
I remember one said there were no mixes in the lines to make the matter spicy and no matter in the phrase that might accuse the author of putting on airs but called it an honest effort as wholesome as it was sweet and by very much more handsome than fine
If you can remember it begin at this line let me see let me see
By God my lord well spoken with good accent and good judgment
Eventually he finds him Striking too short at the Greeks
His old sword Rebelling against his arm lies where it falls Resisting his commands
Not matched equally Pyrrhus lunges at Priam strikes wild in rage But with the whiff and wind of his fierce sword The shaken father falls
Then senseless Priam Seeming to feel this blow flaming at his top Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash Cuts off prisoner Pyrrhus' ear
Behold
his sword Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam seemed in the air to stick
So like a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood And as if not giving in to his will and body Did nothing
But as we often see a silence in the heavens After some storm the gales stand still The bold winds speechless and the earth below As hushed as death and eventually the dreadful thunder Tears the region so after Pyrrhus' pause A roused anger renews him and he begins to work And never did the One eyed monster’s hammers fall On the god of war’s amour forged for eternal strength With less sorrow than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam
Out out you loose woman Fortune
All you gods In general meeting take away her power Break all the spokes and curved rims from her wheel And bowl the hub of the wheel down the hill of heaven As low as you can to kill the fiends
This is too long
It shall go to the barber's to be cut with your beard
I beg you continue
He's for a jig or a dirty tale or he sleeps
Continue come to Hecuba
Wrapped up queen” is good
Run barefoot up and down threatening the flames With blind tears a cloth on that head Where lately the crown had stood and for a robe About her thin loins exhausted from child bearing A blanket caught up in the panic of fear Whoever had seen this with a very poisoned tongue Would have pronounced treason against Fortune's state
But if the gods themselves saw her then When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport By chopping her husband’s limbs with his sword The instant burst of noise that she made Unless mortal events can’t move them at all Would have made the burning eyes of heaven milk And rouse passion in the gods
Look where he has turned pale and has tears in his eyes
I beg you no more
It is well
I’ll have you speak out the rest of this soon
My good lord will you see the players well taken care of
Do you hear me
Let them be well used for they are the short stories and brief history of the time
After you die it would be better to have a bad epitaph then than their ill report while you live now
My lord I will use them according to their class
God’s bodkin man better
Use every man according to his class and who should escape whipping
Use them according to your class
The less they deserve it the more credit it is to you
Take them in
Come sirs
Follow him friends
we'll hear a play tomorrow
Do you hear me old friend
We'll have it tomorrow night
Yes my lord
Very well
Follow that lord and see you don’t mock him
I’ll leave you till night
You are welcome to Elsinore
My good lord
Yes so God be with you
Now I am alone
O what a idle wandering and peasant slave I am
Isn’t it monstrous that this actor here Only in a play in a dream of passion Could force his soul so to his own actions That his grew pale from the words of the speech Tears in his eyes separation from reality in his face A broken voice and his whole function matching Forms to his role
And all for nothing
For Hecuba
What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba That he should weep for her
What would he do If he had the motive and the cue for passion That I have
He would drown the stage with tears And split the audience’s with horrid speech Make the guilty crazy and shock the innocent Confuse the ignorant and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears
Am I a coward
Who calls me villain
Breaks my head across
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
Tweaks me by the nose
Lies about me in the throat As deep as the lungs
Bloody bawdy villain
Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
O vengeance
Why what an ass I am
This is most brave That I the son of a dear father murdered Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell Must like a whore release the content of my heart with words and fall down cursing like a very drab Menial servant in the kitchen
Shame on it
Argh
Change course my brain
I have Heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play Have been so struck to the soul By the very cunning of the scene that presently They have confessed their evil deeds Because murder although it is silent will speak With its own most miraculous organ I’ll have these Players play something like the murder of my father Before my uncle
I’ll observe his looks I’ll watch his every move
Even if he only winks I know what I have to do
I’ll need to have more proof than this
The play's the thing Wherein I’ll see the conscience of the king
And can’t you by any circumstance Get from him why he puts on this craziness Grating all his days of quiet so harshly With turbulence and dangerous lunacy
He does confess that he feels himself troubled But he will by no means speak about the cause
Nor do we find him easy to figure out the reason why Because with a crafty craziness keeps his distance When we try to bring him to some confession Of his true state
Did he receive you well
Most like a gentleman
But with much forcing to make himself do it
Difficult to question but when we ask for something He is most free in his reply
Did you try to get him To engage in any pastime
Madam it just so happened that certain players We passed on the way here
We told him about them And it seemed to make him happy To hear of it
They are here at the court And I think they are already hired To play before him tonight
This is very true And he begged me to invite your majesties To hear and see the play
With all my heart and it makes me happy To hear that he is so inclined
Good gentlemen cut him some slack And keep his attentions on these delights
We shall my lord
Sweet Gertrude leave us too For we have secretly sent for Hamlet to come here That here he may as if by accident Meet Ophelia
Her father and I lawful spies Will so hide ourselves that seeing but unseen We may honestly judge their encounter And gather from him or how he behaves If it’s the affliction of his love or not That he suffers like this for
I really hope your virtues Will bring him to his usual way again To the honor of both of you
Madam I wish it may
Ophelia you walk here
Gracious king if it pleases you We will bestow ourselves
Read this book Showing that such an exercise may colours Your loneliness
We are often to blame in this it’s been proven often that with devotion's face and holy actions we sugar over The Devil himself
O it is too true
How hurting a lash that speech gives my conscience
The prostitute's cheek covered with makeup Isn’t more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my very artificial words
O heavy burden
I hear him coming
Let's hide my lord
There's the respect That makes a mess of long life For who would bear the whips and scorns of time The oppressor's wrong the proud man's insults The pangs of rejected love the law's delay The inexperience of office and the disdain That patient merit takes from the unworthy When he himself might his final settlement make With a bare sharp knife
Who would bear these burdens To grunt and sweat under a weary life Except that the dread of something after death The undiscovered country from whose borders No traveler returns puzzles the mind And makes us bear those problems we have Rather than fly to others that we don’t know about
In this way a conscience can make cowards of us all And in this way the natural color of making up your mind Is covered with the pale shadow of thinking And projects of great substance and significance And in this regard their movement turns erratic And lose the name of action
Wait
The fair Ophelia
Nymph in your eyes May all my sins be remembered
My good lord How has your honor been for this many a day
I humbly thank you Well well well
My lord I have mementos of yours That I have longed to re deliver to you for a long time
I beg you take them back now
My honored lord you know right well you did And with them words composed of so sweet an air As made the things more rich
Their sweet air being Gone take them back again because to the noble mind Rich gifts grow poor when the givers prove unkind
There my lord
Are you sincere
My lord
Are you truthful
What do you mean
That if you be sincere and truthful your sincerity shouldn’t have any talks to your beauty
Could beauty my lord have better dealings than with sincerity
Yes truly for the power of beauty will transform sincerity from what it is to a pimp faster than the force of sincerity can translate beauty into his image
This used to be contradictory but now the time proves it’s true
I did love you once
Indeed my lord you made me believe so
You should not have believed me for virtue can’t graft a new plant onto our old stock but we shall relish of it
I didn’t love you
I was deceived all the more
Get yourself to a convent
Why would you give birth to sinners
I don’t care about my sincerity but I could accuse myself of such things that it were better my mother had not had me
I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offenses at my command than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to commit them in
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven
We are wicked men all believe none of us
Take yourself a convent
Where's your father
At home my lord
Shut the doors on him that he may play the fool nowhere else but in his own house
Goodbye
O help him you sweet heavens
If you do by Mary I’ll give you this curse for your wedding gift whether you as chaste as ice as pure as snow you shalt not escape slander
Go to a convent go
Goodbye
Or if you will marry make it a fool by Mary for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them
To a convent go and quickly too
Goodbye
O heavenly powers restore him
You dance you walk and you whisper and nickname animals and make your looseness your ignorance
I say we will have no more marriages
those that are married already all but one shall live the rest stay the same
To a convent go
O what a noble mind here is conquered
The courtier's scholar's soldier's eye voice sword The hope and flower of Denmark The mirror of fashion and the mold of perfect form The observed of all observers quite quite taken down
And I of all ladies most dejected and wretched That has tasted the honey of his musical vows Now see that noble and most royal mind Like sweet bells jangling out of tune and harsh to hear That form and feature of blown youth without equal Totally crazy
O woe is me To have seen the man I have seen see the man I see
Love
his affections don’t go that way And what he said though it was a little unorganized Wasn’t like craziness
There's something in his soul Over which his depression sits like a bird on an egg And I doubt that egg will hatch and the “bird” Will be something dangerous which to prevent I have quickly decided To write it down like this
Happily the seas and different countries With other things shall cure and get rid of This problem in his heart that has such a hold on him Which his still active brain makes him like this From being himself
What do you think about it
It’ll be OK
But I still believe The source and beginning of his grief Began with rejected love
How are you Ophelia
My lord do as you please But if you think it’s OK after the play Let his queen mother talk to him all alone and beg him To share his problem
Let her be strict with him And I’ll be hide if it pleases you so I can hear Of all their conference
If she can’t find out what’s wrong Then send him to England or lock him up where You think is the best place
That’s what I’ll do
Craziness in great ones must not go unwatched
Speak the part I beg you as I read it to you lightly on your tongue
But if you just repeat it as many actors do I would prefer the town crier spoke my lines
O it offends me to the soul to hear a hefty fellow with a wig tear an emotion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the cheap seats who for the most part are capable of nothing but confusing pantomime and noise
Please avoid it
I assure you
But don’t be too tame either but let your own discretion be your teacher
Fit the action to the word the word to the action with this special rule that you don’t overstep the simplicity of being natural for anything so overdone is not the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as it were the mirror up to nature to show truth in reality scorn her falseness and his form and force to the very age and body of the time
Now this overacting or lateness though it make the ignorant laugh can only make the experienced grieve in whose opinion you must outdo a whole theatre of other audiences in your performance
O there are actors that I have seen perform and heard others praise and highly too not to speak too harshly that having neither the accent of Christians nor the walk of a Christian a pagan or a man have so strutted and yelled that I have thought some of nature's hired help had made them and not made them well they imitated mankind so dreadfully
I hope we have calmly overcome those problems sir
O overcome them with zeal
That's horrible and shows very bad manners in the fool that uses it
Go get ready
How are you my lord
Will the king hear this piece of work
And the queen too and they should be here presently
We will my lord
What here Horatio
Here sweet lord at your service
Horatio you are just like the man That my conversation just now praised
Why should the poor be flattered
No let the sweet tongue lick ridiculous vain glory And bend the obvious hinges of the knee Where poverty may follow flattery
Do you hear me
Since my dear soul controlled her choice And could recognize men of truth her choice Has taken you for herself
Because you have been As one that in suffering all that suffers nothing A man that Fortune's feasts and rewards Have taken with equal thanks and blessed are those Whose blood and judgment are so well blended That they are not an instrument for Fortune's finger To play whatever song she pleases
Give me that man That is not passion's slave and I will wear him In my heart's core yes in my heart of heart As I do you
OK enough of that
There is a play tonight before the king
One scene of it comes near the circumstances Which I have told you of my father's death
I beg you when you see that act begin Even with the very criticism of your soul Watch my uncle
If his hidden guilt Don’t show itself in that one speech It is a false ghost that we have seen And my imaginations are as unstable As god of fire’s anvil
Watch him carefully Because I will have my eyes riveted on his face And after the play we will combine our observations In condemning of his actions
Well my lord
If he steals anything the while this play is going on And he escapes detection I will pay for the theft
They are coming to the play
I must be idle
Go get yourself a seat
How’s our cousin Hamlet
Excellent really of the chameleon's dish
I eat the air crammed with promises
You can’t eat capons that way
No for me now
My lord you acted once when you were in the university you say
That did I my lord and I was accounted a good actor
What did you enact
I did enact Julius Caesar I was killed in the Capitol Brutus killed me
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a stupid fellow there
Are the players ready
Come hear my dear Hamlet sit by me
O ho
Do you see that
Lady shall I lie in your lap
No my lord
I mean lay my head on your lap
Yes my lord
Do you think I meant sexual matters
I think nothing my lord
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs
What is my lord
Nothing
You are merry my lord
Who me
Yes my lord
O your only dancer
What should a man do but be merry
Because look how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died within these two hours
No it is four months my lord
So long
No then let the devil wear black for I’ll have a suit of black fur
O heavens
Died two months ago and not forgotten yet
By Mary this is miching mallecho it means mischief
It’s as if this show describes the argument of the play
We shall know by this fellow
The players cannot keep a secret they'll tell all
Will he tell us what this show meant
Yes or any show that you'll show him
If you are not ashamed to show he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means
Keep quiet keep quiet
I’ll watch the play
For us and for our tragedy Here stooping to your clemency We beg you listen patiently
Is this a prologue or a ring of flowers
It is short my lord
As woman's love
So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us count again before love is finished
That I don’t trust you
Now you know how I love you has been proven to you And as my love is cannot be measured so is my fear
Where love is great the littlest doubts are very fearful Where little fears grow great great love also grows there
Such love must be treason in my breast
Let me be cursed if I marry again
No one marries the second without killing the first love
The reasons for a second marriage Are low respects of saving money but not for love
I kill my husband dead a second time When second husband kisses me in bed
I believe you believe what you say now But what we determine to often we don’t
Promises are only good when you remember them Born of violence but poor truth Which now like unripe fruit stays on the tree But fall without shaking them off when they are ripe
It is very necessary that we forget To pay ourselves what we owe to ourselves
What we promise ourselves in a fit of passion When the passion ends so does the promise
The violence of either grief or joy Destroys their own keeping of them with themselves
Where joy celebrates grief mourns greatly Grief joys joy griefs on a very slender event
This world doesn’t say yes and it’s not strange at all That even our loves should change with our fortunes Because it’s a question we have to prove When love leads fortune or if fortune leads love
But to go back to where I started Our wills and fates run in so much in different directions That our plans are still turned upside down Our thoughts are ours but their results aren’t ours
So you think you won’t marry again But you’ll change your mind when your first lord is dead
If she should break the moment now
It is a very deep oath
Sleep rock your brain And may misfortune never mischance between us two
Madam how like you this play
The lady protests too much I think
O but she'll keep her word
Have you heard the story
It’s not offensive is it
No no
They only pretend pretend to poison no offense in the world
What’s the name of the play
The Mousetrap
By Mary how
A metaphor
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna
but what o' that
your majesty and we that have free souls can’t be touched by it
Let the bitter hussy kick our saddles don’t pinch
This is one Lucianus nephew to the King
You are a good chorus my lord
I could translate between you and your love if I could see the toys flirting
You are forward my lord you are forward
It would cost you a night in bed to take the edge off me
Even better and worse
And that’s how you must take your husbands
Begin murderer argh
Enough with the bad faces and begin
He poisons him in the garden for his estate
His name's Gonzago
The King rises
What frightened by false fire
How are you my lord
Stop the play
Give me some light
Let’s go
Lights lights lights
Wouldn’t this do it sir together with a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn against with me with two Provincial roses on my shoes I took off to get me a fellowship for writing with a pack of players sir
Half a share
You might have rhymed those lines
O good Horatio I’ll take the ghost's word for as real as a thousand dollars
Did you see
Very well my lord
When the talk was about the poisoning
I watched him very well
Ah ha
Come some music
Come some music
My good my lord may I a word with you
Sir I’ll give you a whole history
The king sir Yes sir what about him
He’s in his retirement to bed exceedingly upset
With drink sir
No my lord rather with anger
You’d be wiser and look better if you told all this to the doctor because for me to try to purge him of anger would probably make him more angry
My good lord please re phrase what you’re saying and don’t give me answers so far away from my question
I am calm sir
Ask away
The queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit has sent me to you
You are welcome
No good my lord this courtesy is not the right answer
Sir I cannot
What my lord
but sir such answer as I can make you shall command or rather as you say my mother shall command
OK I’ll say no more but to the problem
O wonderful son that can so astonish a mother
But isn’t there a sequel that follows this mother's surprise
She wants to speak with you in her bedroom before you go to bed
We shall obey if she were ten times our mother
Have you any else to tell me
My lord you loved me once
And I still do by these thieves and robbers
My good lord what is your cause of your problem
You certainly bar the door to your own freedom if you don’t tell your problems to your friend
Sir I don’t have a promotion
How can that be when the king himself says you will succeed him to the throne in Denmark
Yes sir but “While the grass grows”  the proverb is a bit old fashioned
O the pipes
Let me see one
To divert your attention why do you go about trying to figure me out as if you’re to pick a fight
O my lord if my duty is too bold it’s because my love has no manners
I don’t understand that at all
Will you play on this pipe
My lord I can’t
I beg you
Believe me I can’t
I’m begging you
I don’t know how to play it my lord
It’s as easy as lying
Just close up these holes with your finger and thumb put it in your mouth and blow and it will yield the most eloquent music
Look you these are the holes to cover
Why look here at what an unworthy a thing you make of me
You would play me you would seem to know my holes to cover you want to pick out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the my highest note and there is much music excellent voice in this little pipe yet you can’t play it
Do you think it is easier to play me than a pipe
Call me whatever instrument you want to although you can try to cover my holes me you can’t play me
God bless you sir
My lord the queen wants to speak with you right now
Do you see that cloud over there that's almost in shape of a camel
By the mass it is indeed like a camel
I think it is like a weasel
It is shaped like a weasel
Or like a whale
Very like a whale
Then I will go to my mother by and by
I will say so
By and by is easily said
Leave me friends
Now it’s the very witching time of night When churchyards awake and hell itself breathes out Disease to this world
Now I could drink hot blood And do such wicked deed that the day Would shake nervously to see
Listen
now to my mother
O heart don’t give up now don’t ever let the soul of Nero the crazy emperor enter this determined heart
I don’t like him and it doesn’t seem to be safe to us To let his craziness run free
The terms of our estate may not endure With danger so near to us as his craziness seems To get worse by the hour
We will get ourselves ready
It’s a most holy and religious fear To keep those many many bodies safe That depend upon your majesty
The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and amour of the mind To keep itself from madness but much more so For that spirit on whose government the lives of many Depend and rest
The government of a King Dies with him but draws what's near it with it like a gulf
It is a massive wheel Set at the top of the highest mountain In which its huge spokes ten thousand little things Are firmly glued together that when the wheel falls Each small piece insignificant event Adds to the noisy ruin of the country
The King never Sighed by himself but with the whole country’s groan
Get started I beg you on this speedy voyage For we will control this fear Which now goes about too freely
We will go quickly
My lord he's going to his mother's bedroom
I’ll hide myself behind the curtain so I can hear what happens I’ll guarantee she'll set him Straight
And as you said and wisely it was said It is proper that some beside his mother Since nature makes them subjective should overhear The speech objectively
Goodbye my lord
I’ll call on you before you go to bed And tell you what I know
Thanks my dear lord
What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with my brother's blood Isn’t there enough rain in the sweet heavens To wash it as white as snow
What use is mercy Except to confront the face of offense
And what's in prayer except this double force To be prevented from falling down Or pardoned since we are down
Then I’ll look up My sin is committed
But O what form of prayer Can help me
Forgive me of my foul murder
That can’t be it since I still have All those things for which I did the murder My crown my own ambition and my queen
May one be forgiven a sin and still hold on to its benefits
What then
What stops
I’ll see what being sorry does
What can’t it do
O heart as black as death
O dissolving soul that struggling to be free Is more a slave
Help angels
Make an attempt
Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel Be soft as the muscles of the newborn baby
All may be well
I must think about that
A villain kills my father and for that I his sole son do this same villain send To heaven
O this is a contract and pay not revenge
He took my father grossly full of food With all his sins on his soul as full of bloom as May And how his report stands who knows except heaven
No
Up sword and know a more horrid intention
When he is asleep drunk or in his rage Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed At gaming swearing or committing some act That has no element of salvation in it Then attack him so that his heels may kick at heaven And that his soul may be as damned and black As hell where it goes to
My mother is waiting
This relief only makes your sickly days longer
My words go up my thoughts stay here below
Words without thoughts never go to heaven
He will come right away
See that you are direct with him
Tell him his pranks have been too excessive to put up With and that your grace has taken a lot of heat because Of him
I’ll hide here silently
I beg you be firm with him
Hide I hear him coming
Now mother what's the matter
Hamlet you have offended your father very much
Mother you have offended my father very much
Come come you answer me stupidly
Go go you answer me with wickedness
Why how can you Hamlet
What's the matter now
Have you forgotten I’m your mother
No by the church I haven’t
You are the Queen your husband's brother's wife And I wish it wasn’t so but you are my mother
No then I’ll send those to you who can speak
What will you do
You wilt not murder me
Help help ho
What ho
help help help
Draws
O I am slain
O me what have you done
No I don’t know
Is it the king
O what a thoughtless and bloody deed this is
A bloody deed
Almost as bad good mother As killing a king and marrying his brother
As killing a king
Yes lady that’s what I said
You wretched rash intruding fool goodbye
I mistook you for the King
Leave wringing of your hands
Quiet
What have I done that you dare scream at me So loudly and rudely
Heaven's face glows  Yes this solid and compound body With a trustful face  as against the end of the world Is sickened by the thought of the act
Ah me what act Roars so loudly and thunders in the wind
Look here upon this picture and on this one The representation of two brothers
Here is your husband like a mildewed ear of corn Poisoning his wholesome brother
Have you got eyes
Could you feed on this fair mountain And glut yourself on this swamp
Huh
have you got Eyes
What devil Was it that trick you like this with a blindfold
Eyes without feeling feeling without sight Ears without hands or eyes smelling without them all Or a sickly part of one true sense Couldn’t act like this without a conscious thought
O shame
Aren’t you embarrassed
Rebellious hell If you can rebel in an old lady’s bones Then let virtue be like wax to burning youth And melt in her own fire
Proclaim no shame When the compulsive passion takes charge Since frost itself burns as well And reason pimps the will
O Hamlet don’t say anything else
You turn my eyes into my very soul And there I see such black and grainy spots As will not leave their color
No but to live In the rotten sweat of an greasy bed Stewed in corruption using sweet words and making love Over the nasty pig sty
No more
A king of shreds and patches
Save me and hover over me with your wings You heavenly guards
What does you gracious figure want
Alas he's crazy
Don’t you come to scold your tardy son That forgetting time and passion lets The important acting of your dread command go by
O tell me
Don’t forget
This visitation Is only to sharpen your almost dull purpose
But look amazement sits on your mother’s face
Speak to her Hamlet
How are you lady
Alas how are you That you look on empty space And carry on a conversation with the invisible air
Your spirits wildly peep from your eyes And as the sleeping soldiers at the alarm Your bedded hairs like life in growths Start up and stand an end
O gentle son Sprinkle cool patience on the heat and flame of your Anger
Where do you look
On him on him
Look how pale he glares
Then what I have to do Will need true colours tears perhaps for blood
To whom do you speak this
Do you see nothing there
Nothing at all yet all that I see is
You hear nothing
No nothing but ourselves
Why look there
Look how it steals away
My father in his clothes as he lived
Look where he goes even now out the door
This is the very product of your brain
This bodiless creation Is very cunning In imagination
Imagination
My pulse does temperately keep time like yours And is just as healthful as yours
It’s not craziness That I have spoken
Test me And I will re word the problem which madness Would run away from
Mother for love of grace Don’t put that flattering oil on your soul That says my craziness speaks and not your sin
It will only create a scab and film over the ulcer While rotten corruption working within everything Infects it unseen
Confess yourself to heaven Repent what's past avoid what is to come And don’t spread fertilizer on the weeds To make them more rotten
Forgive me my truth Because in the fatness of these wealthy times Virtue itself must beg pardon of vice Yes beg and court for permission to do him good
O Hamlet you cut my heart in two
O throw away the worse part of it And live the purer life with the other half
but don’t go to my uncle's bed Act as though you have a virtue if you don’t have it
That monster habit who eats all sense Of all evil habits is an angel in this That in order to use fair and good actions He likewise gives a dress or uniform That is ready to wear
The next more easy For use can almost change what is natural And can either curb the devil or throw him out With wondrous effectiveness
I am sorry but heaven has decided it to be this way To punish me with this act and punish this act with me That I must be their whip and whip er
I will hide him and will answer the death I gave him well
So again goodnight
One word more good lady
What shall I do
Don’t think it’s good to tell him For who except a queen fair sober wise Would hide from a frog from a bat a cat Such dear concerns
Who would do so
No in spite of sense and secrecy Don’t open the basket on the roof Let the birds fly and like the famous ape To test conclusions don’t creep into the basket And break your own neck
Be assured if words are made of breath And breath is made of life I have no life to breathe What you have said to me
I must go to England you know that
Alack I had forgotten
Let it be Because it’s the sport to have the swordsman Killed with his own sword and it won’t be easy But I will dig one yard below their mines And blow them at the moon
O it is most sweet When you can kill two birds with one stone
Mother goodnight
Indeed this counselor Is now most still most secret and most grave Who was a foolish gabby rogue in life
Come sir to finish up with you
Good night mother
There's a problem in these sighs
Where is your son
Leave us alone for a little while
Ah my good lord what have I seen tonight
What Gertrude
How is Hamlet
As crazy as the sea and wind when both fight over Which is mightier
In his wild fit Hearing something stir behind the curtain He whips out his knife cries 'A rat a rat
And in this headstrong state kills The hidden good old man
O heavy deed
It would’ve been us if we had been there
His freedom is full of threats to everyone To you yourself to us to every one
Alas how shall this bloody deed be explained
It will be our fault who Should’ve kept this mad young man on a short leash Restrained and out of society
But we loved him so much That we would not understand what was the best action But like the owner of a dirty disease To keep it from showing let it feed Even on the core of life
Where has he gone
He weeps for what is done
O Gertrude let’s go
Ho Guildenstern
Friends both go get some further assistance
Hamlet has Polonius slain in insanity And he has dragged him from his mother's bedroom
Go find him speak gently and bring the body Into the chapel
I beg you hurry
Come Gertrude we'll call up our wisest friends And let them know both what we mean to do And what's done at an unfortunate time
so maybe slander whose whisper covers the entire world As surely as the cannon hits its target and Delivers his poisoned shot may miss our name And not amount to anything at all
My soul is full of confusion and sorrow
Safely hidden
Hamlet
Lord Hamlet
What’s that noise
Who calls Hamlet
Here they come
What have you done my lord with the dead body
Mixed it with dust to which it is related
Tell us where it is that we may take it from there And carry it to the chapel
Don’t believe it
Believe what
That I can keep your advice and not my own
You take me for a sponge my lord
Yes sir that soaks up the King's face his rewards his authorities
But such officers do the king best service in the end
He keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw first to be tasted and then at last swallowed
When he needs what you have found out it is by squeezing you and sponge you shall be dry again
I don’t understand you my lord
I am glad of it
A clever speech is wasted on a stupid ear
My lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king
The body is with the king but the king is not with the body
The king is a thing A thing my lord
Of nothing
Bring me to him
Hide fox and show all later
I have sent to find him and the body
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose
Yet we must not put the strong law on him
He's very popular with this country’s masses Who like not in their minds but with their eyes And where it is so the offender's punishment is important but never the offense
To deal with everything smoothly and evenly this sudden sending him away must seem like a planned event
Diseases grown desperate are best healed by desperate measures Or not at all
We cannot get from him Where the dead body is hidden my lord
But where is he
Outside my lord guarded to know what you want
Bring him before us
Ho Guildenstern
bring in my lord
Now Hamlet where's Polonius
At supper
At supper
Where
Not where he eats but where he is eaten
A certain group of educated worms are now biting him
Your worm is your only emperor for diet
We fatten up all other creatures to fatten us up when we fatten ourselves for maggots
Your fat king and your lean beggar interchangeable two dishes but for one table
That's the end
Alas alas
A man may fish with the worm that has eaten a king and eat the fish that has fed on that worm
What do you mean by this
Nothing but to show you how a king may progress through the guts of a beggar
Where is Polonius
In heaven
Send there to see
If your messenger can’t find him there look for him in the other place yourself
But indeed if you don’t find him within this month you will smell him as you go up the stairs into the lobby
Go find him there
He will stay until you come
Hamlet for this deed for your special safety Which we do consider as we dearly grieve For what you’ve done we must send you away With fiery quickness
For England
Yes Hamlet
Good
So it is if you knew our reasons
I see an angel that sees them
But come for England
Goodbye dear mother
Your loving father Hamlet
My mother
Father and mother is man and wife man and wife is one flesh and so my mother
Come for England
I’ll have him away tonight
Away
because everything is sealed and done That relies on this affair
I beg you hurry
And England if you hold my love at anything As my great power may give you some sense Since your scar still looks raw and red After the Danish sword and your open fear Pays homage to us you might not view Our sovereign process coldly which gives you full power By letters testifying to that effect The present death of Hamlet
Do it England Because he rages like the pace of my blood And you must cure me
Until I know it is done However great my luck my joys can never begin
Go Captain send my greetings to the Danish king
Tell him that with his permission Fortinbras Desires to carry out a promised march Over his kingdom
You know the meeting place
If his majesty has anything for us to do We shall express our duty in person And let him know so
I will do it my lord
Go softly on
Good sir whose armies are these
They are from Norway sir
For what purpose sir I beg you
Against some part of Poland
Who commands them sir
The nephew to old Norway Fortinbras
Does it go against the main part of Poland sir Or for some frontier
To speak honestly and with no addition to the facts We go to gain a little patch of ground That’s not worth anything except its name
To pay five dollars five I wouldn’t farm it And it won’t yield either to Norway or the Poles A worse rate if it should it be sold in payment
Why then the Poles never will defend it
Yes it already has garrisons
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand dollars Will not settle the question of who owns this worthless land
This is the abscess of much wealth and peace That breaks inward and shows no damage until The man dies
I humbly thank you sir
God be with you sir
Will you please go my lord
I’ll be with you right away
Walk a little before me
How every event works against me To spur my dull revenge
What is a man If his chief good and use of his time Is only to sleep and eat
A beast no more
Surely He that made us with such large capacity Looking before and after didn’t give us That capability and godlike reason To go stale in us unused
Now where it is Beastly forgetfulness or some defeated principle Of thinking too much on the event A thought which cut in quarters has but one part wisdom And always three parts coward I don’t know Why I am still live to say “This thing's to do “ Since I have cause and will and strength and means To do it
Examples as obvious as dirt urge me
Look at this army of such size and power Led by a delicate and tender prince Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed up Makes faces at the invisible event Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that luck death and danger dare to do Even for an eggshell
Rightly to be great Is not to move without great argument But to find quarrel greatly in worthless land When honor’s at stake
How do I stand then That have a father killed a mother stained Aggravation of my reason and my blood And let all sleep while to my shame I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men That for a whim and trick of fame Go to their graves like going to bed fight for a plot On which the numbers don’t have room to fight for the Cause which is not tomb enough and big enough To hide the slain
O from this time forth My thoughts be bloody or be worth nothing
I will not speak with her
She is unfortunate indeed deranged
Her mood must be pitied
What does she need
She speaks a lot about her father she says she hears There are tricks in the world and coughs and beats her chest Kicks enviously at nothing says things in doubt That only make half sense
her speech is nothing Yet the random use of it moves The listeners to collect them they aim at making sense of It and mix her words up fit to their own ideas Which as her winks and nods and gestures as she Speaks would indeed make someone think there might Be clear though nothing for sure yet very unhappily
It would be good she were spoken with because she May scatter dangerous ideas in rude minds
Let her come in
To my sick soul such as sin's true nature is Each new thing seems to be the prelude to some great harm
Guilt is so full of artless jealousy that It spills itself in fearing to be spilled
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark
How should I know your true love From another one
By his whimsical bat and his staff And his sandal shoes
Alas sweet lady what does this song mean
What did you say
No I beg you listen
He is dead and gone lady He is dead and gone At his head a grass green turf At his heels a stone
No but Ophelia I beg you listen
His shroud is as white as the mountain snow Alas look here my lord
All covered with sweet flowers Which drowned in tears went to the grave With showers of true love
How do you pretty lady
Well God protect you
They say the owl was a baker's daughter
Lord we know what we are but don’t know what we may be
God be at your table
Thinking on her father
Then up he rose and put on his clothes And opened the chamber door Let in the maid that rejected a maid and Never left again
Pretty Ophelia
Indeed la without an oath I’ll make an end on it
By God and by Saint Charity Pity and for shame for shame
Young men will do it if they come to it By God they are to blame
How long has she been like this
I hope all will be well
We must be patient
but I cannot choose but weep to think they would lay him in the cold ground
My brother shall know of it
and so I thank you for your good counsel
Come my coach
Follow her closely watch her well I beg you
O this is the poison of deep grief it all springs From her father's death
O my dear Gertrude this worry Compared to a murdering piece gives me more than Enough death in many places
For pity’s sake what’s this noise
Where are my Swiss guards
Let them guard the door
What is the matter
Save yourself my lord
The ocean exceeding of his borders Doesn’t eat the flatlands with more impatient speed Than young Laertes heading a riot Takes over your offices
The crowd calls him lord And as the world were just beginning now Old history forgotten customs not known They certify and prop up every word They cry “We choose
O this is rebellion you false Danish dogs
The doors are broken
Where is this king
Sirs you all wait outside
No let's come in
I beg you leave me alone
We will we will
I thank you
Guard the door
O you vile king Give me my father
Calmly good Laertes
That drop of blood that's in control says I’m a bastard Cries my father’s wife was unfaithful brands the harlot Even here between the chaste unmarked brows Of my true mother
What is the cause Laertes That your rebellion looks so huge
There's such divinity that surrounds a king That treason can only peep to what it would do Acts little by his will
Tell me Laertes Why are you so angry like this
Let him go Gertrude
Speak man
Where is my father
Dead
But he didn’t do it
Why is he dead
Vows to the blackest devil
Conscience and grace to the deepest pit
I dare damnation
Who shall prevent you from it
My will alone nothing else in the world
And I’ll use my methods so well That they shall go far with little effort
Good Laertes If you desire to know the circumstances Of your dear father's death is it written in your revenge That in the gambling you will draw both friend and foe winner and loser
No one but his enemies
Will you know them then
I’ll open my arms wide like this to his good friends And like the pelican of the old fables Feed them with my own blood
Why now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman
It shall penetrate your understanding That I am innocent of your father's death And am most sincerely in grief for it As day penetrates your eye
Let her come in
How now
What’s that noise
O heat dry up my brains
Tears with seven times the Salt burn out the sight and truth of my eyes
Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia
O heavens
Is it possible a young maid's sanity Should be die as does an old man
Nature is short in love and where it is short It sends some precious moment of itself Close to the thing it loves
They bore him barefaced on the bier Hey no nonny nonny hey nonny And on his grave rained many a tear
Fare you well my dove
Had you your sanity and you persuaded me to revenge It couldn’t move like this
It is the false servant that stole his master's daughter
This “nothing” is more than just a story
There's fennel for you and columbines
there's rue for you and here's some for me
There's a daisy
I would give you some violets but they withered all when my father died
And will he not come again
And will he not come again
No no he is dead Go to your death bed He never will come again
His beard was as white as snow All white was his hair
He is gone he is gone And we go away crying
God have mercy on his soul
And of all Christian souls I pray God
God be with you
Do you see this O God
Laertes I must share your grief Or you deny me my rights
Step aside Choose whichever of your wisest friends you want And they shall hear and judge between you and me
If they find that we killed your father or had him killed We will surrender our kingdom Our crown our life and all that we call ours To you in satisfaction but if not You must be patient with us And we shall work together with your soul To give it just compensation
I agree His means of death his obscure burial No trophy sword no coat of arms over his bones No noble rites or state funeral Cry to be heard from heaven to earth as it were That I must call it into question
And so you shall And wherever the guilt is that’s where the punishment will be
I beg you go with me
Who wants to speak with me
Sailors sir
They say they have letters for you
Let them in
I don’t know from what part of the world I should be contacted if not by Lord Hamlet
God bless you sir
Let him bless you too
He shall sir if it pleases him
Horatio when you read this give these fellows some way to talk to the king
They have letters for him
Before we were even at sea for two days a very nasty looking pirate chased us
Finding ourselves sailing too slow we put up a great fight and in the skirmish I boarded them
Just then they sailed away from our ship so only I became their prisoner
Let the king have the letters I have sent and come to see me with as much haste as you would fly death
I have words to speak into your ear will make you speechless but are they much too light for the heart of the matter
These good fellows will bring you to where I am
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are still going to England
I have much to tell you about them
Goodbye
He that you knows you HAMLET
Then you can direct me To him you delivered them for
Now you must see that I am not guilty And you must put me in your heart as a friend Since you have heard and with a knowing ear That man who killed your noble father Wanted to kill me
It seems to be the truth
but tell me Why didn’t you take action against these things So full of crime and punishable by death As you mainly were upset By concern for your safety wisdom if nothing else
O for two special reasons Which may to you perhaps seem a bit cowardly But yet to me they are strong
The queen his mother Lives almost by his looks and for myself Whether it’s my virtue or my plague She's so necessary to my life and soul That as the star moves only in his orbit I couldn’t do anything without her say so
The other motive why I couldn’t go to a public court Is the great love the people of this country have for him Who dipping all his faults in their affection Would like the spring that turn wood to stone Convert his crimes to graces so that my actions Not at all popular with the masses Would have reflected badly on me And not be taken as I intended them
And so I have lost a noble father A sister driven into insanity Whose worth if praises may go back again Stood as a challenger to the most beautiful woman of all Time for her perfections
but my revenge will come
Don’t lose any sleep over it
You mustn’t think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our power be shaken with danger And think it unimportant
You will soon hear more
What news
Letters my lord from Hamlet
This one to your majesty this one to the queen
From Hamlet
Who brought them
Sailors my lord they say I didn’t see them
Laertes you shall hear them
Leave us alone
High and mighty You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom
What does this mean
Are all the rest returning
Or is it some trick and no such thing
Do you recognize the writing
It’s Hamlet's handwriting
I have no idea my lord
But let him come
How can it be otherwise
Yes my lord Just as long as you don’t ask me to forget about it
Only to your own satisfaction
It’s falling into place
You have been talked about since your travel so much For a quality where they say you really shine
All your parts together Didn’t arouse such jealousy in him As did that one and that in my regard Is his weak spot
What part is that my lord
A very ribbon in the cap of youth But necessary too for youth doesn’t look less well in The fun and reckless clothes that it wears Than old age settles for his black furs and woolens Showing health and seriousness
Two months ago There was a gentleman from Normandy here I’ve seen myself and served against the French And they can do well on horseback but this gallant Had witchcraft in it
He grew into his seat And had his horse do such wonderful things As if he had been absorbed into the horse’s body With the brave beast
He so impressed me That I through lies and tricks Didn’t waste time in finding out what he did
A Norman was it
A Norman
I swear Lamond
The very same
I know him well
He is the jewel indeed And gem of the whole nation
Sir this report of his Poisoned Hamlet with envy That he couldn’t do anything but wish and beg Your sudden coming over her to play with him
Laertes was your father dear to you
Not that I think you didn’t love your father But because I know love is begun by time And I see in the ways of love That time dampens the spark and fire of it
Within the very flame of love there lives A kind of wick or snuff that will put it out And nothing is worse than goodness staying still For goodness growing to an infectious flu Dies in his own too much
What we want to do We should do when we would for this 'would' changes And has stoppages and delays as many As there are voices hands accidents And then this 'should' is like the sigh of a spendthrift That hurts by easing up
But to the heart of the matter
Hamlet comes back
What would you do To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words
To cut his throat in the church
Murder indeed should not be a church activity because Then revenge should have no bounds
When Hamlet returns he shall know you’re Home
We'll start rumors that praise your excellence And exaggerate the fame The Frenchman gave you bring you together in the end And place bets on your fight
He being weak Most generous and free from all trickery Will not think about swords so that easily Or with a little mix up you may choose A sword that’s not poisoned and in a pass during Practice kill him in revenge for your father
I’ll do it
And for that purpose I’ll poison my sword
I bought an oil of a mountebank So mortal that only dip a knife in it Where it draws blood no super potion so rare Collected from all antidotes under the moon That have always worked can save the thing from death And this is only with a scratch
I’ll touch the point of my sword with this poison so that if I touch him slightly It will kill him
Therefore this project should have a plan B or C that might hold if this first one failed
Hang on
Let me think
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings I have it
While you’re moving around and you are hot and dry Since you’ll make your bouts more violent to that purpose and he calls for drink I’ll have prepared a Goblet for him for that purpose so that even only sipping If he escapes your stick of venom by luck We can be successful this way
What now sweet queen
One sorrow walks on the heels of another Following too fast
Your sister's drowned Laertes
Drowned
O where
Alas then she is drowned
Drowned drowned
You had too much water poor Ophelia And therefore I’ll hold back my tears but It is still our trick nature holds her habits Let shame say what it will
When these tears are gone Woman will be extinct
Farewell my lord
I have a rumor of fire that I would gladly spread Before this news puts the fire out
Let's follow him Gertrude
I had all I could do to calm his anger
Now I fear this will make it start all over again Therefore let's follow him
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully seeks her own salvation
I tell you she is and therefore make her grave straight
The coroner has decided and finds it Christian burial
How can that be unless she drowned herself in her own defense
Why that’s the coroner’s finding
It must be self offense
It can’t be anything else
Here lies the water good
Here stands the man good
But is this law
Yes by Mary it’s the coroner’s inquest law
Will you know the truth about it
If this hadn’t been a gentlewoman she should have been buried without a Christian burial
Why there you’ve said it
And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than another Christian
Come my spade
There are no old gentlemen but gardeners ditchers and grave makers
They hold up Adam's profession
Was he a gentleman
He was the first that ever bore arms
Why he had none
What are you a pagan
How do you understand the Scripture
The Scripture says Adam digged
Could he dig without arms
I’ll put another question to you
The gallows maker for that frame outlives a thousand tenants
I like your joke I swear
Do it again come on
Who builds stronger than a mason a shipbuilder or a carpenter
Yes tell me that and stop my guessing
By Mary now I can tell
Do it
Mass I cannot tell
Go get you to Johann bring me a mug of whiskey
In youth when I did love did love I thought it was very sweet To contract O the time for ah my reason O I thought there was nothing meet
Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at grave digging
Habit has made it a property of easiness in him
That’s true
The one that doesn’t work has the more delicate sense
But age with his stealing steps Has clawed me in his clutch And has shipped me until the land As if I had never been such
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
How the man jowls it to the ground as if it were Cain's jawbone that did the first murder
This might be the head of a politician which this ass now reaches over one that would go around God might it not
It might my lord
Or of a courtier which could say 'Good morrow sweet lord
How are you good lord
This might be my lord so and so that praised my lord such and such's horse when he meant to ask for it might it not
Yes my lord
Why even so
and now my Lady Worm's no jaw and knocked about the face with a sexton's spade
Here's fine turnaround if we were able to see it
Did these bones cost no more the making of them but to play at games with them
Mine ache to think about it
A pickaxe and a spade a spade For and a shrouding sheet Oe a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is ptoper
There's another
why can’t that be the skull of a lawyer
Where are his arguments now his pens his cases his subpoenas and his tricks
Why does he allow this rude fellow to knock him about the head now with a dirty shovel and will not tell him why he’s being hit
Hum
This fellow might have been a great buyer of land in his time with his statutes his emblems his fine art his double billing his house seizures
Is this the finest of his fine art and the seizure of his house seizures to have his fine pate full of fine dirt
Will his billing bill him no more for his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth of a pair of property liens
The very transfers of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must the inheritor himself have no more huh
Not a jot more my lord
Isn’t parchment made of sheep skins
Yes my lord And of calf skins too
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that
I will speak to this fellow
Whose grave is this sir
Mine sir
O a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet
I think it’s yours indeed for you lie in it
You lie out of it sir and therefore it’s not yours
For my part I don’t lie in it yet it ‘s mine
You do lie in it to be in it and say it is yours
It is for the dead not for the quick therefore you lie
It is a quick lie sir it will go away again from me to you
What man dot you dig it for
For no man sir
What woman then
For none neither
Who is to be buried in it
One that was a woman sir but rest her soul she's dead
How absolutely clever this chap is
We must speak by the book or lying will undo us
By the Lord Horatio these three years I have noted that the age is grown so picky that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he hurts his feelings
How long have you been a grave maker
Of all the days in the year I became a grave maker the day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras
How long is that since
Can’t you tell that
Every fool can tell that
It was the very day that young Hamlet was born he that is crazy and sent into England
Yes by Mary why was he sent to England
He shall get his mind back there or if he doesn’t it's no great problem there
Why
It will not be seen in him there
There the men are as crazy as he is
How did he become crazy
Very strangely they say
How strangely
Actually even by losing his mind
On what grounds
Why here in Denmark
I have been sexton here man and boy thirty years
How long will a man lie in the earth before he rots
Well if he’s not rotten before he dies as we have many small pox corpses nowadays that will scarce last beyond the wake he will last you some eight years or nine years
A tanner will last you nine years
Why he more than another
Why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while and your water is a sore decayer of your wretched dead body
Here's a skull now
This skull has been buried three and twenty years
Whose was it
A bastard crazy fellow's it was
Whose do you think it was
No I know not
A pestilence on him for a crazy rogue
He poured a pint of Rhine wine on my head once
This same skull sir was Yorick's skull the king's jester
This one
Just that one
Alas poor Yorick
I knew him Horatio a fellow of infinite fun of most excellent imagination
I want to vomit
Here hung those lips that I have kissed I don’t know how many times
Where are your jokes now
Your games
Your songs
Your flashes of laughter that always make the audience roar
No one now to mock your own grinning
Quite jaw fallen
I beg you Horatio tell me one thing
What's that my lord
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this in the earth
Yuck
Just like that my lord
What common uses we may return to Horatio
Why can’t imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander until he finds it stopping a wine barrel
It’s thinking about it too much to think like that
Emperor Caesar dead and turned to clay Might stop a hole to keep the wind away
O that the earth which kept the world in fear Should patch a wall to expel the winter's cold
But quiet
Who is that they’re following
And with such shortened rites
This shows that The corpse they follow did with a desperate hand Commit suicide
It was of some nobility
Let’s hide and listen
What other ceremony
That is Laertes A very noble youth
Look
What other ceremony
Her funeral rites have been as far enlarged As we can enlarge
Isn’t there more be done
Lay her in the earth And may violets spring from her fair And unpolluted flesh
I tell you churlish priest My sister shall be a ministering angel When you lie howling
What the fair Ophelia
Sweets to the sweet
farewell
I hoped you would have been my Hamlet's wife I thought to have decorated your bride bed sweet maid And not your grave
O three times sorrow Fall ten times treble on that cursed head Whose wicked deed deprived you of your most wonderful Intelligence
Stop the burial a while Until I hold her once more in mine arms
Now bury the living and dead Until you have made a mountain from this flat earth To be higher than the mountain of Italy or the skyish head Of blue Mount Olympus
This is I Hamlet the Dane
The devil take your soul
You don’t pray well
I beg you take your fingers from my throat For although I am not impatient and rash I still have something dangerous in me Which you should fear
Take away your hand
Separate them
Gentlemen
My good lord be quiet
Why I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer blink
O my son what theme
I loved Ophelia
Forty thousand brothers Couldn’t even with all their quantity of love Make up my sum
What will you do for her
O he is crazy Laertes
For love of God leave him alone
God’s wounds show me what you'll do
I’ll do it
Be buried quickly with her and so will I
And if you babble about mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us until our ground Singeing his head against the burning sun Make the highest mountain like a wart
No if you’ll Speak I’ll rant as well as you
Eventually as patient as the female dove When that her golden twins are discovered His silence will sit drooping
I always loved you
But it’s not important
Let Hercules himself do what he may The cat will mew and every dog will have his day
Good Gertrude put a guard over your son
This grave shall have a living monument
So much for this sir
Now as for the other thing You do remember all the circumstances
Remember it my lord
Sir there was a kind of fighting in my heart That wouldn’t let me sleep
I thought I lay Worse than in a rebellion in the chains
such ghosts and goblins in my life That on my arrival without any delay No not even to wait for the grinding of the axe My head should be chopped off
Is it possible
But will you listen to how I proceeded
Go ahead
Being surrounded like this with evil plans Before I could start thinking about it before They could execute the plan I sat myself down Though up a new order wrote it just like the original
I used to think as our politicians do A sin to make a forgery and worked hard at How to forget that learning but sir now It did me a useful service
Do you want to know The effect of what I wrote
Yes good my lord
An earnest oath from the king As England was his faithful ally As love between them might flourish like the palm tree As peace should still wear her wheaten garland And stand like a comma between their friendships And many “as es” like that of great emotion That on the view and knowledge of these contents Without further discussion more or less He should the bearers put to sudden death Not even allowing time for confession and penance
How was this sealed
Why even in that was heaven good to me
Now the next day Was our sea fight and what followed You know already
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to it
Why man they did make love to this job
Their defeat Grew by their own actions
It is dangerous when the lower nature comes Between the ups and downs Of mighty opposites
Why what a king is this
Doesn’t it do you thank become my responsibility to kill He that has killed my king and whored my mother Push himself in between the election and my hope to be King tried to kill me And with such knowledge isn’t it perfect duty To kill him with this arm
and isn’t it to be damned To let this canker of our nature do Further evil
The time between is mine And a man's life is longer than it takes to say “One
But I am very sorry good Horatio That I forgot myself to Laertes Because by the image of my cause I can see Myself in him
I’ll court his favors
But for sure the bravery of his grief put me Into a towering passion
Quiet who’s coming here
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark
I humbly thank you sir
Do you know this water fly
No my good lord
Your state is the more gracious for it is a vice to know him
He has much fertile land
Let a beast be lord of beasts and his cattle shall stand at the king's dinner table
He’s a clown but as I say proud to own dirt
Sweet lord if your lordship were not busy I should impart a thing to you from his majesty
I will listen very carefully
Put your hat to its right use
It is for the head
I thank your lordship it is very hot
No believe me it is very cold the wind is northerly
It is unusually cold my lord indeed
I think it is very sultry and hot for my complexion
Exceedingly my lord it is very sultry I can’t tell how
But my lord his majesty asked me to tell you that he has placed a great wager on your head
Sir here Laertes is newly come to court believe me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent traits of very soft manners and looking great
Indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or calendar of gentry because you shall find in him the continent of what a gentleman is
Sir his refinement suffers no lie from you although I know to divide him like an inventor would make the memory dizzy with arithmetic and yet not off course in regard to his quick sail
But in the truth of praise I take him to be a soul of great note and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make true talk of him he is what you see and whoever copies him is his shadow nothing more
Your lordship speaks most truly of him
The concern sir
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rare breath
Sir
Isn’t it possible to understand in another tongue
You will do it Sir really
What about the naming of this gentleman
Of Laertes
Of him sir
Well sir
I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him by them in his skill he has no equal
What's his weapon
Sword and dagger
That's two of his weapons
but never mind
What do you call the carriages
I knew you must be aware of the margin before you had finished
The carriages sir are the hangers
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannons by our sides
I would it might be hangers till then
But on
Why is this all wagered as you call it
What if I say no
I mean my lord the fight of your person in trial
Sir I will walk here in the hall
If it please his majesty it is the relaxing time of day with me
Shall I re deliver your answer like that
With my meaning sir however you want to say it
I commend my duty to your lordship
Yours yours
He does well to praise himself because no one else will praise him
A just hatched bird runs away with eggshell on his head
He did comply with his mother’s breast before he sucked it
He has and many more just like him that I know the worthless age dotes on are only part of a craze and have the outward appearance of style a kind of swollen collection which carries them through and through the most airless opinions and only blows them to their real experience when the bubbles are burst
My lord his majesty sent a message to you by young Osric who tells him that you will meet him in the hall
He want to know if will play with Laertes now or whether you will take a longer time
I am true to my intentions they follow the king's pleasure
If he is ready now I am too now or whenever provided that I am so able as I am now
The King and Queen and all are coming down
In happy time
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you start to play
She instructs me well
You will lose this wager my lord
I don’t think so
Since he went to France I have been in constant practice
I shall win at the odds
But you wouldn’t know what a bad feeling I have inside
But it doesn’t matter
No my good lord It’s only foolishness but it is such a kind of misgiving as would maybe trouble a woman
If you have a gut feeling obey it
Being ready is everything
Since no man has anything of what he leaves what is it to leave soon
Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me
Give me your pardon sir
This King knows and you must have heard How I am punished with a painful madness
What I have done That might deeply hurt your nature honor And complaints I here proclaim was craziness
Was it Hamlet who wronged Laertes
Never Hamlet
Who does it then
His madness
Sir before this audience Let my denial of evil intent Give me immunity in your most generous thoughts As though I have shot my arrow over the house And hurt my brother
I am satisfied in nature Whose motive in this case should move me the most To my revenge
But in my terms of honor I hold back and will make no reconciliation Until by some elder masters of known honor I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name unbloody
But until that time I receive your offered love like love And won’t do it wrong
I accept it freely And will play this brother's wager honestly
Give us the swords come on
Come one for me
I’ll be your mirror Laertes
In my ignorance Your skill shall like a star in the darkest night be shown to its fiery advantage indeed
You mock me sir
No honestly
Give them the swords young Osric
Cousin Hamlet You know the wager
I have seen you both But since he's gotten better we have therefore odds
I like this one
All these swords have a length
Yes my good lord
Set up the goblets of wine for me on that table
If Hamlet gives the first or second hit Or quits in answer of the third exchange Let all the battlements fire their ammunition The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath And in the cup he shall throw a pearl Richer than that which four successive kings Have worn in Denmark's crown
Give me the cups And let the kettle drum speak to the trumpet The trumpet to the cannon man outside The cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth 'Now the king drinks to Hamlet” Come begin
And you the judges watch carefully
Come on sir
Come my lord
One
No
Judges
A hit a hit that was felt
OK again
Stay give me drink
Hamlet this pearl is your Here's to your health
Give him the cup
I’ll play this bout first put it aside a while
Come on
A touch a touch I do confess
Our son shall win
He's fat and out of breath
The queen drinks to your fortune Hamlet
Good madam
Gertrude don’t drink
I will my lord I beg you to pardon me
It is the poisoned cup it is too late
I dare not drink yet madam by and by
Come let me wipe your face
My lord I’ll hit him now
I don’t think so
And yet it is almost against my conscience
Come for the third Laertes
You say so
Come on
Nothing neither way
I’ll attack you now
Part them
They are in a rage
Look to the queen there ho
They bleed on both sides
How are you my lord
How are you Laertes
Why as a woodpecker caught in my own trap Osric
I am justly killed with my own wickedness
How is the Queen
She swoons to see them bleed
No no
I am poisoned
O villainy
Ho
Let the doors be locked
Wickedness
Find it
It is here Hamlet
Hamlet you are killed No medicine in the world can save you
The evil deed Has turned itself on me
Behold here I lie Never to rise again
Your mother's poisoned
I can do no more
The King the King's to blame
The point poisoned too
Then venom do your work
Treason
Treason
O still defend me friends
I am only hurt
Here you incestuous murderous damned Dane Drink this potion
Is your marriage here
Follow my mother
Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet
And I am not guilty of yours
Heaven forgive you for it
I follow you
I am dead Horatio
Wretched queen goodbye
Never believe it
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane
Here's some poison wine still left
O good Horatio what a wounded name that is Things left unknown like this shall live after me
If you ever did hold me in your heart Stay away from happy things for a while And in this harsh world draw your breath in pain To tell my story
What warlike noise is this
Young Fortinbras after conquering Poland Gives this warlike volley To the ambassadors of England
I cannot live to hear the news from England But I do predict that the throne belongs To Fortinbras
Now a noble heart breaks
Good night sweet prince And flights of angels sing you to your rest
Why does the drum come here
Where is this sight
What do you want to see
If anything of sorrow or wonder stop your search
This scene is chaotic
O proud death What feast is being held in your eternal cell That you have killed so many princes So bloodily all at the same time
The sight is sad And our affairs come too late from England
The ears that should give us hearing can’t hear To tell him his order is obeyed That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
Who will thank us
No thanks from his mouth If it were alive to thank you
He never gave orders for their deaths
But since you from the Polack wars and you from England are here arrived and so jump on this bloody Question give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about
So you shall hear Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts Of accidental judgments casual slaughters Of deaths planned by cunning and false causes And in this result mistaken motives Fallen on the planners' heads
I can truly deliver All this
Let us hurry to hear it And call the noblest to hear it too
As for me I embrace my fortune with sorrow
I have some rights of past history in this kingdom Which now invites me to claim my place
I shall also have cause to speak of that And directly from his mouth whose voice will deliver it
But let this speaking be done now Even while men's minds are wild lest more mischance On plots and errors happen
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the platform For he was likely had he been King To have proved most royal and for his passage The soldiers' music and the rites of war will Speak loudly for him
Take up the bodies
Away
Go home you idle creatures go home
Why sir I’m a carpenter
Where is your leather apron and your ruler
Truly sir in respect of a fine worker I’m only as you would say a cobbler
But what’s your trade
Just tell me that
A trade sir that I hope I may use with a clear conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
What’s your trade you deceitful man
You naughty Deceitful man what’s your trade
No Please sir don’t be angry with me yet if you’re angry sir I can mend you
What do you mean by that
Mend me you rude fellow
Yes sir mend you
You’re a mender are you
Truly Sir all that I live by is with the sharp little tool I don’t stick my nose into any tradesman's matters or women's matters but with awl
I’m indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they’re in great danger I re cover them
Many proper men that ever walked on cowhide leather have walked on my work
But why aren’t you in your shop today
Why do you lead these men in the streets
Truly sir so I can wear out their shoes to get myself more work
But really sir we have taken a holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
Why rejoice
What conquest does he bring home
What people who pay him tribute follow him to Rome To decorate his chariot’s wheels with their chains and bonds
You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome Didn’t you know Pompey
Many times You’ve climbed up to the walls and lookout posts To the towers and windows yes to chimney tops Your infants in your arms and you’ve sat there The entire day waiting patiently To see great Pompey pass through the streets of Rome
And when you saw his chariot appear Haven’t you made one great big shout that was so loud The Tiber River trembled underneath her banks To hear the echo of your sounds That bounced off her hollow shores
And do you now put on your best attire
And now you decide to call a holiday
And now you throw flowers in the way if the man That comes in triumph over Pompey's death
Get going
Run to your houses fall on your knees Pray to the gods to stop the plague That must be the punishment for this ingratitude
Go go good countrymen and for this mistake Get all the poor men like you together Bring them to the Tiber River’s banks and weep your tears Into the water until the lowest stream Floods the highest shores of heaven
See whether they’ll really do what you suggested Their guilt made them vanish in silence
You go down that way towards the Capitol I’ll go this way
May we do that
You know it is the feast of the priest Lupercus
It doesn’t matter don’t let the statues Be hung with Caesar's trophies
I'll go around And drive the low people away from the streets You do this too where you see many of them gathered together
Caesar speaks
Stand directly in Antony’s way When he runs his course Antony  Caesar my lord
I’ll remember
When Caesar says "Do this" I do it
Go on and don’t leave any ritual out
Caesar
Ha
Who calls
Everyone quiet  Peace
Who’s calling for me
I hear a voice that is more shrill than all the music Yelling "Caesar"
Beware the Ides of March
Who is that man
A man who can tell the future is telling you to beware March 15
Bring him here let me see his face
Fellow come here look at Caesar
What do you say to me now
Speak again
Beware the Ides of March
He’s a dreamer let’s get away from him
Let’s go
Will you go see the order of the winners of the race
I don’t like games I lack some part Of that quick spirit that Antony has
Don’t let me hold you up Cassius go if you like I'll leave you
You’re too stubborn and too strange To your friend that loves you
I’m annoyed lately With different passions Ideas that only I can know Which are perhaps seen in my behavior But don’t let my good friends be upset  Cassius you’re one of them  Or try to understand my indifference any further Than that poor Brutus at war with himself Forgets to show friendship to other men
Then Brutus I have really misunderstood your passions Which is why this my heart has forgotten Thoughts of great value worthy thoughts
Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
No Cassius because the eye can only see itself In a mirror or by some other thing like it
And it’s very much lamented Brutus That you don’t have any mirrors that will Let you see your own hidden worthiness Any mirrors that you might let you see your shadow
I have heard that many of the best respected men in Rome  Except immortal Caesar  speak about Brutus And groaning underneath the political burden of this age Have wished that noble Brutus could see what they see
What dangers would you lead me into Cassius That you want me to search for something That I don’t have in myself
For that reason good Brutus get ready to hear what I have to say And since you know you can’t see yourself Except in a mirror I’ll be your mirror And will modestly let you see That in yourself which you don’t know about
And don’t be angry with me gentle Brutus I wish I were a common comedian or used To urinating on my friendship with ordinary oaths To every new opponent if you know That I show false friendship to some men and hug them hard And after that tell lies about them or if you know That I profess myself at feasts to be friends with The entire place then think about me dangerous
What does this shouting mean
I’m afraid the people Are going to choose Caesar for their king
Yes you fear it
Then I must think you wouldn’t want it
What do you want to tell me
I know you’ve that virtue Brutus As well as I know your face
Well honor is the subject of my story
I can’t tell what you and other men Think of this life but for myself alone I would rather not live to be In awe of such a thing as I’m
And indeed he did so
And now this man Has become a god and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bow Even if Caesar only nods at him carelessly
He had a fever when he was in Spain And when the fit was on him I noticed How he shook
I heard him groan
Another general shout
I believe that this applause is For some new honors that are to be heaped on Caesar
Why man he stands on top of the narrow world Like the Colossus of Rhodes and we little men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves disgraceful graves
Brutus" and "Caesar” What is in that name "Caesar
Why should that name be sounded any more than yours
Write them down together your name is just as good Say them out loud your name sounds just as good Think about their importance yours is just as important Use them to contact ghosts "Brutus" will bring a spirit As soon as "Caesar
Now in the names of all the gods at once What meat does this our Caesar eat That he’s grown so great
Age shame on you
Rome there are no more people of noble bloods in you
Has there ever been any age since Noah and the flood That was not famous because of more than one man
When could they say until now those that talked about Rome That her wide walls were ruled by only one man
Is Rome still Rome and does it have room enough When there is in it only one man
O you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have fought The eternal devil to keep his status in Rome As easily as he would fight a king
I’m not angry that you’re my friend As for what you’re persuading me to do I have some plans
I’ll tell you later what I’ve thought about this And about these times for now Please don’t to try to persuade me any further
I’ll think about what you’ve said I’ll patiently hear what you’ve to say and find a time When I can both meet with you to hear and answer such high things
I’m glad that my weak words Have brought out this show of fire from Brutus
The games are finished and Caesar is returning
As they pass by grab Casca by the sleeve And he’ll in his sour way tell you What notable events have happened today
Calpurnia's cheek is pale and Cicero Looks with the same beady and fiery eyes That we have seen on him in the Capitol When some senators disagreed with him in a meeting
Casca will tell us what’s wrong
Antonius  Caesar
Don’t be afraid of him Caesar he's not dangerous He’s a noble Roman and has a good disposition
I wish he were fatter
He reads a lot He’s a great observer and actually he looks Through the deeds of men
Such men as he is are never at ease in their hearts When they see a man greater than themselves And for that reason they are very dangerous
I would rather tell you what to be afraid of More than what I am afraid of for I’m always Caesar
Come over here my right side because I am deaf in this ear And tell me what you really think of him
You pulled my sleeve do you want to speak with me
Yes Casca tell us what has happened today That makes Caesar look so sad
Why you were with him weren’t you
If I was then I shouldn’t ask Casca what had happened
Why there was a crown offered to him and when it was Offered to him he pushed it away with the back of his hand like this And then the people started shouting
What was the second noise for
Why for that too
They shouted three times
What was the last cry for
Why for that too
Was the crown offered to him three times
Yes damn it it was and he pushed it aside three times Every time more gently than the last and at each pushing aside My honest neighbors shouted
Who offered him the crown
Why Antony
Tell us how it happened gentle Casca
I may as well be hanged as to tell how it happened
It was merely a joke I didn’t pay attention to it
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown yet it wasn’t a crown either it was one of these large hats and as I told you he pushed it aside once
but for all that to my thinking he seemed eager to have it
but to my thinking he was very reluctant to remove his fingers off it
And then he was offered it the third time he pushed it aside the third time and still as he refused it the crowd shouted and clapped their rough hands and threw their sweaty night hats into the air and uttered such a great deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that the smell almost choked Caesar because he fainted and fell down from it
And for mine part I didn’t dare laugh for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the bad air
What did Caesar faint
He fell down in the market place foamed at the mouth and was speechless
No Caesar doesn’t have it but you and I And honest Casca we have epilepsy
I don’t know what you mean by that but I’m sure Caesar fell down
If the common people didn’t applaud him and hiss at him since he pleased and displeased them as they used to do to the actors in the theatre then I’m not really a man
What said he when he came to
Damn it before he fell down when he thought the common herd was glad he had refused the crown he opened his shirt and offered to cut his throat
When he came to again he said if he had done or said anything out of order he wanted the people to think it was his infirmity
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done the same thing
And after that he came away sad
Yes
Did Cicero say anything
Yes he spoke in Greek
How did that work
Goodbye
There was more nonsense if I could only remember it
Will you have dinner with me tonight Casca
No I’ve got another engagement
Will you dine with me tomorrow
Yes if I’m alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating
Good I’ll expect you
What a blunt fellow he’s turned out to be
He was becoming very spirited when he was in school
So he is now in getting any bold or Noble job done However he pretends to be slow in nature
This rudeness is the topping to his good traits Which lets men accept his words With better understanding
And so it is
I’ll leave you now
Tomorrow if you want to speak with me I’ll come to your house or if you like Come to my house and I’ll wait for you
OK that’s fine
Tonight I will throw writings in his windows All tending to the great opinion that Rome holds his name by several different hands as if they came from several citizens In these writings I will analyze although obscurely Caesar's ambition
And after this let Caesar sit more securely on his throne Because we will shake him from there or endure worse days
Good evening Casca
Did you bring Caesar home
Why are you breathless and why are you staring like that
Aren’t you moved when the entire earth Is shaking uncontrollably
Either there is a civil strife in heaven Or else the world has been too impudent with the gods Incensing them to send destruction
Why have you seen anything more wonderful
A common slave you’d know him well by sight  Held up his left hand which flamed and burned Like twenty torches all together and yet his hand Not feeling any fire wasn’t even scorched
Besides I haven’t used my sword since  I met a lion in front of the Capitol Who glared at me and angrily passed me by Without attacking me and there were a hundred ghastly Women gathered in a heap Transformed by their fear who swore they saw Men all on fire walking up and down the streets
And yesterday the night bird sat In the marketplace in the middle of the day Howling and shrieking
When these omens All happen at the same time don’t let men say "These things have their reasons they’re natural" For I believe they’re warning signs That predict the climate that they point to
Indeed time has a strange disposition But men may interpret things in whatever way they like Far from the purpose of the things themselves
Does Caesar come to the Capitol tomorrow
He does because he asked Antonius to Send word to you that he would be there tomorrow
Good then Casca
This disturbed sky Isn’t one to walk in
Goodbye Cicero
Who's there
A Roman
Casca I can tell by your voice
You have a good ear
Cassius what night this is
A very pleasing night to honest men
Who ever knew the heavens could be so threatening
Those men that know the earth is full of faults
For my part I have walked about the streets Giving in to the dangerous night And undressed like this Casca as you can see I have bared my chest to the thunder bolts And when the angry blue lightning seemed to openThe chest of heaven I put myself Even in the direction and the very flash of it
But why did you tempt the sky like that
It is part of men to be afraid and tremble When the most mighty gods send Lightening to astonish us
You’re not too sharp Casca and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you want Or else you don’t use what you have
You look pale and dazed And put on fear and make yourself wonder To see the strange behavior of the Heavens
But if you would think about the true cause Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts Why birds and beasts from quality and kind Why old men fools and children think about it  Why all these things change from their usual order Change their natures and their normal events To monstrous disorder why you shall find That Heaven has infused the lightening with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning About some monstrous state
Now I could Casca Name a man to you that is most like this dreadful night One that thunders send lightening opens graves and roars As the lion in the Capitol does A man no mightier in personal action Than you or I yet he’s grown monstrous And fearful just as these strange eruptions are
It’s Caesar that you mean isn’t it Cassius
our fathers' minds are dead And we are governed by our mothers' spirits Our burden and suffering makes us look womanish
Indeed they say that the senators Mean to establish Caesar as a king tomorrowAnd that he will be king everywhere In every place except here in Italy
In that event you gods you make the weak the strongest In that event you gods you defeat tyrants
No stony tower no walls of beaten brass No airless dungeon no strong chains of iron Can hold the strength of the spirit But life tired of these worldly bars Never lacks the power to kill itself
If I know this and know the whole world too I can shake off at pleasure That part of tyranny that I endure
I can too
And so every slave has in his own hand The power to cancel his captivity
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then
Poor man
I know he wouldn’t be a wolf But he sees that the Romans are nothing but sheep
He wouldn’t be a lion if Romans weren’t female deer
Those that are in a hurry will make a mighty fire and Start it with flimsy straws
What trash Rome is What rubbish and what garbage when it serves As the fuel to start a fire that will throw light On so vile a thing as Caesar
But O grief Where have you taken me
Perhaps I say this Before a willing slave
Stay take my hand
Be a rebel for revenge for all these problems And I’ll support you as far As the man who goes the farthest
It’s a deal
Now you know Casca I have already persuaded Some certain of the noblest minded Romans To join me in an undertaking Of honorable/dangerous consequence And I know by this they are waiting for me In Pompey's Porch
For now because of this fearful night There’s no noise or walking in the streets And the weather reflects The work we have at hand Most bloody fiery and most terrible
Stand next to me for a while because someone is coming hastily
To find you
Who's that
Metellus Cimber
No it is Casca one who agrees With our attempts
Isn’t someone waiting for me Cinna
I’m glad about it
What a fearful night is this
There's two or three of us who have seen strange sights
Isn’t someone waiting for me
Tell me
Yes They are
O Cassius if you could only persuade The noble Brutus to join us  Don’t worry
When you’ve done all that Go to Pompey's Porch where you shall find us
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
All but Metellus Cimber and he's gone To your house to find you
Well I’ll get going And so deliver these papers as you asked me
Three parts of him Are ours already and at our next meeting The whole man will be ours
You’ve judge his worth and our great need of him Very well
Let’s go Because it is after midnight and before day We’ll wake him up and be sure that he’s with us
Wake up I say
Hey Lucius
You called my lord
Light a candle in my study Lucius
When it is lit come back and call me here
I will my lord
He must die and for my part I don’t know a personal cause to throw at him But for the general complaints
A bright day brings out the black poison snake And that means we must walk carefully
Crown him  that
And then I admit he may do danger at his will with A sting that we put in him
The abuse of greatness is when it disconnects Remorse from power and to speak truth about Caesar I haven’t known a time when his emotions were swayed More than his reason
The candle burns in your bedroom sir
Searching the window for a match I found This paper sealed up like this and I’m sure It wasn’t there when I went to bed
Go back to bed it isn’t day
Isn’t tomorrow boy the Ides of March
I don’t know sir
Look at the calendar and come back and tell me
I will sir
The vapors whizzing in the air Give off so much light that I can read by them  "Brutus you sleep
Wake up and see yourself
Wake up " Such instigations have often been dropped Where I have picked them up
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe
What Rome
My ancestors drove Tarquin from the streets of Rome When he was called a king  "Speak strike revenge
Am I begged thenTo speak and strike
O Rome I promise you If revenge follows you will receive Everything you ask for at the hand of Brutus
Sir it’s the fifteenth day of March
Good
Sir it’s your brother Cassius at the door Who wants to see you
Is he alone
No sir there are more with him
Do you know them
No sir their hats are drawn over their ears And half their faces are buried in their cloaks So that I couldn’t tell from their clothes or faces Who any of them are
They’re the rebels O conspiracy Shame on you for showing your dangerous eyes by night When evils are most free
O then by day Where will you find a cavern dark enough To hide your monstrous face
Don’t find any conspiracy Hide it in smiles and friendliness Because if you pass your real face on Not even the dark place between heaven and hell itself Is dim enough to hide you from being stopped
I think we are too bold to interrupt your sleep
Good morning Brutus are we troubling you
Do I know these men that come along with you
Yes every one of them and every man here Respects you and every one wishes You had that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman has for you
This is Trebonius
He’s welcome here
This Decius Brutus
He’s welcome too
This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber
They’re all welcome  What worries are keeping you From sleeping
May I have a word with you
This direction is east
Doesn’t the day break here
No
O pardon sir it does and the gray lines over there That adorn the clouds are the messengers of dawn
You’ll see that you’re both wrong
Here where I point my sword the Sun rises Which is going a great way to the South Bringing in spring
Some two months away up higher toward the North He first shines and the high East Stands just as the Capitol directly here
Let’s shake hands all over again one by one
And let’s swear our determination
No not an oath
If not the face of men The suffering of our souls the waste of time  If these motives are weak let’s break it off now And every man go away to his lazy rest Let high sighted tyranny range on Until each man drops by chance
But if these events As I’m sure they do bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to harden The melting spirits of women with valor then countrymen What do we need any other motivation except our own causeTo prod us to revenge
What other bonds Than secret Romans that have spoken the word And will not negotiate without honor
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty promised That this promise shall be or we will die for it
Swear priests and cowards and deceitful men Old feeble dead bodies and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs swear to bad causes that Such creatures as men doubt but don’t stain The even goodness of our undertaking or the unsuppressed character of our spirits To think that our cause and our performance Need oaths when every drop of blood That every Roman carries and carries nobly Is guilty of causing the birth of several bastards If he breaks the smallest particle Of any promise that he has made
But what about Cicero
Shall we check him out
I think he’ll stand with us very strongly
Let’s not leave him out
No by no means
It shall be said that his judgment ruled our hands Our youths and wildness won’t appear at all But all be buried in his seriousness
Then leave him out
Indeed he’s not fit
Shall any other man be killed besides Caesar
Our plan will seem too bloody Caius Cassius To cut off the head and then hack off the arms and legs Like anger in death and jealousy afterwards Because Antony is but a limb of Caesar
Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar And in the spirit of men there is no blood
O that we could come by Caesar's spirit then And not dismember Caesar
But alas Caesar must bleed for it
This shall label Our purpose as necessary and not jealous Which appearing to be respectful to common eyes We shall be called purgers not murderers
And for Mark Antony don’t think abut him Because he can do no more than Caesar's arm can do When Caesar's head is cut off
I still fear him Because in the acquired love he bears to Caesar  Alas good Cassius don’t think of him
If he loves Caesar all that he can do Is what he can do to himself   think and die for Caesar
And that’s as much he should do because he’s given To sports to wildness and to having a lot of company
The clock has struck three
It’s time to leave
But it is still doubtful Whether Caesar will come out today or not Because he’s grown superstitious lately Quite a distance from the main opinion he once held About fantasy dreams and ceremonies
It may be these apparent signs The unaccustomed weather of this night And persuasion of his men who tell the future May keep him from the Capitol today
Don’t be afraid of that
I’ll work on this Because I can give his state of mind true purpose And I’ll bring him to the Capitol
No we’ll all be there to go get him
By eight o’clock
Is that the latest
Let that be the latest and be on time
Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar Who berated him for speaking well of Pompey
I wonder why none of you’ve thought about him
Now good Metellus go ask him
He likes me very well and I have given him cause to Just send him here and I'll train him
The morning is coming
We'll leave you Brutus  And friends scatter yourselves but all remember What you’ve said and show yourselves to be true Romans
Lucius Fast asleep
You haven’t got dreams or fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men
Brutus my lord
Portia what are you doing
Why are you up now
It isn’t healthy to expose Your weak condition to the raw cold morning like this
Not for you either
I asked you again then you scratched your head And stamped your foot very impatiently
Still I insisted still you didn’t answer But with an angry wave of your hand You gave me a sign to leave you
So I did Fearing that I might make you more impatient When you seemed already fired up and besides I was hoping it was just a bad mood Which sometimes hits every man
It won’t let you eat or talk or sleep And if it could affect your face and body So much that it conquers your spirit I shouldn’t know you Brutus
My dear lord Please tell me the cause of your grief
I’m not feeling well and that’s all
Brutus is wise and if he were not in good health He would do something about it
Why I do
Good Portia go ahead to bed
What is Brutus sick And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To challenge the evil diseases of the night And tempt the thick and unclean air To add to his sickness
No my Brutus You’ve got some sick worry on your mind Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of and on my knees I order you by my once commended beauty By all your vows of love and that marriage vow Which joined us and made us one That you tell me yourself your half of me Why you’re so depressed and what men Have come to you tonight because there have been Some six or seven here who hid their faces Even from darkness
Don’t kneel gentle Portia
I shouldn’t need to if you were acting like gentle Brutus
Inside the bond of marriage tell me Brutus Is my knowing secrets that appertain to you An exception to our vows
Am I part of you But as it were in sort or limitation  To keep you company at meals sleep in your bed And talk to you sometimes
Do I only live outside Of your good pleasure
If it’s no more than this Then Portia is Brutus' whore not his wife
You’re my true and honorable wife As dear to me as are the red tears That visit my sad heart
If this is true then I should know this secret
I’ll grant you that I’m a woman but I am besides A woman that Lord Brutus married
I’ll grant you that I’m a woman but I am besides A woman of good reputation Cato's daughter
Do you think that I’m no stronger than my sex Being so fathered and so married
Tell me your secrets I won’t reveal them
I have given you strong proof of my constancy Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh
can I suffer that with patience But not my husband's secrets
O you gods Make me worthy of this noble wife
Listen listen someone is knocking
Portia go in awhile And by and by your heart shall hear The secrets of my heart
I’ll tell you all about my meetings All the reasons for my sad brows
Leave me quickly
Lucius who's knocking
Here is a sick man that would speak with you
Allow a good morning from a feeble tongue
I’m not sick if Brutus have any exploit Worthy of the name of honor in hand
I have such an exploit in hand Ligarius That you would hear if you weren’t sick
By all the gods that Romans bow before I here discard my sickness
Soul of Rome
Brave son fathered from honorable loins
You like an exorcist have brought my dead Spirit back to life
Tell me to run now And I’ll do impossible things Yes and get the better of them
What needs to be done
A piece of work that will make sick men well again
But aren’t some well that we must make sick
That we must do that also
What it is my Caius I’ll tell you as we are walking As to whom it must be done
Start walking And I’ll follow you with a new fired up heart To do I don’t know what but it’s enough That Brutus leads me on
Follow me then
Neither heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
Three times Calpurnia has cried out in her sleep "Help oh
My lord
Go tell the priests to do the sacrifice now And bring me their opinions of success
I will my lord
What do you mean Caesar
Do you intend to walk outside
You shall not go out of your house today
Caesar I never believed in omens Yet now they frighten me
Besides the things that We have heard and seen there is a man inside Recounting the most horrid sights seen by the guards
A lioness has given birth in the streets And graves have opened up and given up their dead Fierce fiery warriors fight on the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right forms of war Which drizzled blood on the Capitol The noise of battle screaming into the air Horses neighed and dying men groanedAnd ghosts shrieked and squealed around the streets
What we avoid When the mighty gods dictate how things go
Still Caesar shall go out because these predictions Are not only for Caesar but also for the world in general
Cowards die many times before their deaths The valiant only taste of death once
They say not to go out today
Looking at the guts of an offering They couldn’t find a heart inside the beast
The gods do this in shame of cowardice
Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he stays at home today because he’s afraid
No Caesar shall not
Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he
Alas my lord Your wisdom is consumed in confidence
Don’t go out today
Let me on my knee win this argument
Mark Antony shall say I’m not well And to make you happy I’ll stay home
Here's Decius Brutus he shall tell them so
Caesar all hail
Good morning worthy Caesar
I come to go get you to the Senate house
And you’ve come at a very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators And tell them that I can’t come today
Tell them so Decius
Say he’s sick
Shall Caesar send a lie
Most mighty Caesar let me know some reason In case I’m laughed at when I tell them so
But for your private satisfaction Because I love you I’ll let you know
And these she interprets for warnings and portents And imminent evil and on her knee Has begged me to stay home today
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes In which so many smiling Romans bathed Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood and that great men shall ask For tinctures stains relics and recognition
This is what Calpurnia’s dream means
And in this way you have explained it very well
I have when you’ve heard what I can say And you know it now
The Senate has concluded To give a crown to mighty Caesar this day
If you send them word you’ll not come They may change their minds
Besides it’s might be Interpreted as silly because someone says "Break up the Senate until another time When Caesar's wife shall have better dreams
Pardon me Caesar because my dear dear love To your advancement bids me tell you this And reason is responsible to my love
How foolish your fears seem now Calpurnia
I’m ashamed that I gave in to them
Give me my robe because I’ll go
And look where Publius is coming to go get me
Good morning Caesar
Caesar it’s eight o'clock
I thank you for your pains and courtesy
Ask them prepare inside
I’m to blame to be waited for like this  Now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius
Remember that you call on me today Be near me so that I may remember you
Caesar I will
and so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further away
Good friends go in and taste some wine with me And we like friends will go ahead together straightaway
That every “like” isn’t the same O Caesar That the heart of Brutus yearns to think about
Caesar beware of Brutus be careful of Cassius don’t come near Casca watch Cinna don’t trust Trebonius pay attention to Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus doesn’t love you you’ve sinned against Caius Ligarius
There is only one mind in all these men and it is bent against Caesar
If you’re not immortal look around you
Security gives way to conspiracy
The mighty gods defend you
Boy run to the Senate house Don’t wait to answer me but get going
What are you waiting for
To know what my errand is madam
Set a huge mountain between my heart and tongue
I have a man's mind but a woman's might
Madam what should I do
Run to the Capitol and nothing else
And so return to you and nothing else
I didn’t hear anything madam
Please listen well
I heard a bustling rumor like a riot And the wind brings it from the Capitol
Really madam I hear nothing
At mine own house good lady
What time is it
Almost nine o’clock lady
Has Caesar gone to the Capitol
Madam not yet
I’m going ahead to get my spot To see him pass on his way to the Capitol
You’ve got some petition to Caesar haven’t you
That I have lady
If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear what I have to say I shall beg him to take care of himself
Why do you know if any harm's intended towards him
None that I know definitely but I’m very afraid there’s a chance
Good morning to you Here the street is narrow
The throng that follows Caesar at his heels Of Senators of Praetors common suitors Will crowd a feeble man almost to death
I'll get me to a place with more space and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along
Come back to me again And bring me word about what he says to you
The Ides of March are here
Yes Caesar but not gone
Hail Caesar
Read this petition
Trebonius wants you to read this Humble suit at your leisure
O Caesar read mine first because mine's a suit That touches Caesar nearer
Read it great Caesar
What concerns ourselves shall be the last thing considered
Don’t delay Caesar read it instantly
What is the fellow mad
Servant get away
What do you present your petitions in the street
Come to the Capitol
I wish your undertaking today may thrive
What undertaking Popilius
Goodbye
What did Popilius Lena say
He wished that our undertaking today might thrive
I’m afraid our plan has been discovered
Look how he gets Caesar’s attention
Watch him
If this is known Cassius or Caesar shall never turn back Because I’ll kill myself
Cassius stop worrying
Popilius Lena doesn’t speak about our plan Because look he smiles and Caesar doesn’t notice anything
Trebonius when to act because look Brutus He’s taking Mark Antony out of the way
Where is Metellus Cimber
Let him come And now tell Caesar what it is that he wants
He’s ready get closer and back him up
Casca you’re the first one to strike
Are we All ready
What’s the problem That Caesar and his Senate must fix
Most high most mighty and most powerful Caesar Metellus Cimber falls before you Most humbly
I must stop you Cimber
These lying down and these lowly courtesies Might move ordinary men And turn previous laws and the first decree Into the laws of children
Don’t be so silly as To think that Caesar has such rebel blood That will be changed by The same things that change fools I mean sweet words Low crooked curtsies and playing up to me like a puppy
Your brother is banished by decree
If you do bend and pray and play up to me for him I reject you out of my way like a stray dog
Caesar has never been wrong only with good reason And he will not be satisfied without good reason
Is there any voice more worthy than mine To speak more sweetly into great Caesar's ear To ask for a repeal of my banished brother’s sentence
What Brutus
Cassius falls as low as your foot To beg freedom for Publius Cimber
Speak hands for me
You too Brutus  Then fall Caesar
Liberty
Freedom
Go ahead to the square Brutus
And Cassius too
Where's Publius
Here quite confused by this mutiny
Stand together solidly for fear that some friend of Caesar's Should happen   Don’t talk about standing Publius good cheer
We don’t intend to harm you Or any other Roman
Tell them so Publius
And leave us Publius for fear that the people Will attack us doing some mischief to your old body
Do so  and let no man pay for this deed But we who did it
Where's Antony
Fled to his house amazed
Men wives and children stare cry out and run As it were doomsday
Destiny tell us what comes next
We know we shall die we know it’s only time And drawing days out that men live on
Why he that spends twenty years fearing death Cuts twenty years off his life
I agree and then is death a benefit
How many times will Caesar bleed in amusement That lies now next to Pompey's statue No worthier than the dust
So often as that shall be So often shall the group of us be called The men that gave their country liberty
What shall we go
Yes every man away
Brutus shall lead and we will follow him With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome
Wait who’s coming here
A friend of Antony's
If Brutus will guarantee that Antony May safely come to him and is ready to tell How Caesar deserved to die Mark Antony shall love Brutus living Better than Caesar dead and will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus with all true faith Thorough the hazards of this unconquered state
That is what my master Antony says
Your master is a wise and valiant Roman I always thought so
Tell him if it pleases him come to this place He shall get an explanation and by my honor Leave here safely
I'll go get him now
I know that we shall have him as a friend
I hope that we may but my heart is still Very much afraid of him and my gut feeling is that He cannot be trusted
O mighty Caesar
Do you lie so low
Do all your conquests glories triumphs spoils Boil down to this
If I’m going be killed there is no time like Caesar's death hour or any instrument Half as worthy as your swords decorated richly With the most noble blood in this whole world
Please if you hate me kill me now While your purpled hands smeared with fresh blood
O Antony don’t beg your death from us
Although we must appear bloody and cruel now As you can see by our hands and this recent deed Still you can only see our hands And this bleeding business they have done
You don’t see our hearts they’re full of pity Pity the general injury of Rome   As fire drives out fire so pity drives out pity   Has done this deed on Caesar
For your part Our swords have leaden points to you Mark Antony Our arms in strength of friendship and our hearts Of brotherly disposition receive you With all kind love good thoughts and reverence
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's In giving out the new honorable offices
Only be patient until we have pacified The multitude who are beside themselves with fear And then we will tell you the reason Why I that loved Caesar when I struck him Have acted this way
I don’t doubt your wisdom
Let each man give me his bloody hand
First Marcus Brutus I will shake with you  Next Caius Cassius I take your hand  Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus  Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours  Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius
Gentlemen all alas what shall I say
If I had as many eyes as you’ve got wounds Weeping as fast as they let your blood out It would suit me better than to close In terms of friendship with your enemies
Pardon me Julius
Mark Antony  Pardon me Caius Cassius
The enemies of Caesar shall say all this Then in a friend it is cold shame
I don’t blame you for praising Caesar so But what agreement do mean you to have with us
Will you be counted in the number of our friends Or shall we go on and not depend on you
I shook your hands for that reason but I was really Distracted from the point by looking down on Caesar
I am friends with you all and love you all On this hope that you shall give me reasons Why and how Caesar was dangerous
Or else this was a savage spectacle
Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you Antony the son of Caesar You should be satisfied
You shall do it Mark Antony
Brutus a word with you
I’ll go onto the platform first And explain our Caesar's death
Whatever Antony shall speak I’ll formerly declare That he speaks with our permission And that we are happy that Caesar shall Have all true rights and lawful ceremonies
It’ll be to our advantage more than doing us harm
I don’t know what may happen I don’t like it
Mark Antony here take Caesar's body
You shall not blame us in your funeral speech But speak all the good that you can imagine about Caesar And say you do it by our permission Or else you won’t have any part at all In his funeral
And you shall speak After my speech is ended On the same platform where I’m going to be
I don’t desire any more
Prepare the body then and follow us
O forgive me you bleeding piece of earth That I’m meek and gentle with these butchers
You’re the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
I do Mark Antony
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome
Passion I see is catching for my eyes Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in yours Began to tear
Is your master coming
He lies tonight within twenty one miles of Rome
Get back to him quickly speed and tell him what has happened
Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome A Rome not safe for Octavius yet Get going and tell him so
Stay here for a bit You shall not go back until I have carried this corpse Into the market place
There I shall test In my speech how the people takeThe cruel actions of these bloody men Once I know that you shall tell Young Octavius the state of things
Lend me your hand
I’ll hear Brutus speak
I’ll hear Cassius and compare their reasons Once they have all been told
The noble Brutus is on the platform
Silence
Please wait until I finish
Romans countrymen and friends
Listen to my cause and be silent so you can hear
Believe me based on my honor and have respect for my honor so you can believe
Judge me in your wisdom and wake up your senses so you can be a better judge
If there is anyone in this assembly any dear friend of Caesar's to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his love
If then that friend demands why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more
Would you rather Caesar were living and you all die slaves than that Caesar were dead so you all live freemen
As Caesar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was valiant I honor him but as he was ambitious I killed him
There are tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition
Who is here so low thatthey would rather be a slave
If there are any speak because I have offended him
Who here is so rude that they wouldn’t be a Roman
If there are any speak because I have offended him
Who is here so vile that he will not love his country
If there are any speak because I offended him
I’ll stop so you can reply
None Brutus none
Then I have offended none
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus
The question of his death is recorded on rolls in the Capitol his glory not made thin where he was worthy nor are his offenses recorded for which he suffered death
Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who although he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth just as you all will
With this I leave   that as I killed my best friend for the good of Rome I have the same dagger for myself to be used when it shall please my country to need my death
Bring him home with triumph to his house
Give him a statue with his ancestors
Let him be Caesar
Caesar's better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors
My countrymen  Peace
silence
Brutus speaks
Peace oh
Good countrymen let me leave alone And for my sake stay here with Antony
Respect Caesar's corpse and respect his speech About Caesar's glory which Mark Antony Is allowed to make with our permission
Please no man leave Except I alone until Antony has spoken
For Brutus' sake I’m grateful to you
What does he say about Brutus
He says for Brutus' sake He finds himself grateful to us all
It’s best that he doesn’t speak harm about Brutus here
This Caesar was a tyrant
Yes that's certain
We are blessed that Rome is rid of him
Peace
Let’s hear what Antony can say
You gentle Romans  Peace oh
Let’s hear him
Here with the permission of Brutus and the rest  Because Brutus is an honorable man And they are all all honorable men  I come to speak in Caesar's funeral
Caesar brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms filled the national treasury
Did this seem ambitious in Caesar
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honorable man
You all saw that on the feast of the priest Lupercus I presented a kingly crown to him three times Which he refused three times
Was this ambition
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And sure he’s an honorable man
I don’t speak to disprove what Brutus spoke But I’m here to speak what I know
You all loved him once not without reason
I think there is a lot of reason in what he’s saying
If you rightly think about the matter Caesar has had great wrong done to him
Hasn’t he gentlemen
I’m afraid that a worse man will take his place
Did you pay attention to his words
Caesar wouldn’t take the crown It’s certain he wasn’t ambitious for that reason
If it’s found to be so someone will dearly pay for it
here's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony
Now watch him he begins to speak again
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world
Now lies he there And there is no one too poor to pay him respect
I won’t do them wrong I would rather choose To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you Before I’ll wrong such honorable men
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar  I found it in his bedroom it’s his will
Let only the common people hear this testament  Which pardon me I don’t mean to read  And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood Yes beg a hair of him for memory And dying mention that hair in their wills Leaving it as a rich legacy To their children
We'll hear the will
Read it Mark Antony
The will the will
We will hear Caesar's will
Have patience gentle friends I must not read it It isn’t proper that you know how Caesar loved you
You aren’t wood you aren’t stones you are men And being men hearing the will of Caesar It will inflame you it will make you crazy
It’s good that you don’t know that you’re his heirs Because if you did O what would happen
Read the will
We'll hear it Antony You shall read us the will Caesar's will
Won’t you be patient
Won’t you wait a minute
I went beyond what I was going to say to tell you about it
I’m afraid I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar I really do fear it
They were traitors
The testament
They were villains murderers
The will
Read the will
You’ll force me then to read the will
Then make a circle around the corpse of Caesar And let me show you the man who made the will
Shall I come down
And will you give me permission
You shall have permission
Stand from the hearse stand from the body
Room for Antony most noble Antony
No don’t press so close to me stand a bit away
If you’ve got tears get ready to shed them now
You all know this cloak
I remember The first time Caesar ever put it on It was on a summer's evening in his tent That day he overcame Belgium
Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
This was the most unkindest cut of all Because when the noble Caesar saw Brutus stab him Ingratitude stronger than traitors' arms Quite defeated him
Then his mighty heart burst And in his cloak covering up his face Even at the base of Pompey's statue Which was covered in blood great Caesar fell
O now you weep and I can see that you feel The blow of pity
These tears are full of grace
Kind souls what do you weep when you only see Our Caesar's clothes wounded
Look here Here he is disfigured as you can see by traitors
O piteous spectacle
O noble Caesar
O sad day
O traitors villains
O most bloody sight
Revenge go find burn fire kill slay  don’t let a traitor live
Wait countrymen
Peace there
Hear the noble Antony
We'll hear him we'll follow him we'll die with him
Good friends sweet friends don’t let me stir you up To such a sudden flood of rebellion
They who have done this deed are honorable
I didn’t come friends to steal away your hearts
But if I were Brutus And if Brutus were Antony there would be an Antony to Ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that would move The stones of Rome to rise and rebel
We'll rebel
We'll burn the house of Brutus
Away then
Come find the conspirators
But hear me countrymen still hear me speak
Peace oh
hear Antony most noble Antony
Why friends you go ahead to do you don’t know what
Where has Caesar deserved your loves like this
Alas you don’t know I must tell you then
You’ve forgotten the will I told you of
Here is the will and under Caesar's seal
To every Roman citizen he gives Seventy five dollars each
O royal Caesar
Hear me with patience
Peace oh
Here was a Caesar
When does another like him come
We'll burn his body in the holy place And we’ll set the traitors' houses on fire with the torches
Pick up the body
Go go get fire
Grab down benches
Grab down chairs windows anything
Now let it work Mischief you’re working
Sir Octavius has already come to Rome
Where is he
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house
And I’ll go there straight to visit him
He comes on a wish
Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything
I heard them say Brutus and Cassius Are riding like madmen through the gates of Rome
It’s likely they had some notice from the people How I had moved them
Take me to Octavius
I dreamt tonight that I feasted with Caesar And unlucky things directed my imagination
I don’t want to go out of doors Yet something leads me there
What is your name
Where are you going
Where do you live
Are you a married man or a bachelor
Answer every man directly
Yes and briefly
Yes and wisely
Yes and truly you had better answer
What is my name
Where am I going
Where do I live
Am I a married man or a bachelor
Go on directly
Directly I’m going to Caesar's funeral
As a friend or an enemy
As a friend
That matter is answered directly
For your house briefly
Briefly I live by the Capitol
Your name sir truly
Truly my name is Cinna
I’m Cinna the poet I’m Cinna the poet
Tear him apart for his bad verses tear him apart for his bad verses
I’m not Cinna the conspirator
Tear him tear him
Come brands oh
Some go to Decius' house and some to Casca's some to Ligarius'
away go
These many men then shall die their names are checked on the list
I do consent  Mark him down Antony
On the condition that Publius shall not live Who is your nephew Mark Antony
He shall not live look I condemn him with a check
But Lepidus go to Caesar's house Go get the will here and we shall determine How to cut off some appointments in legacies
What shall I find you here
Here or at the Capitol
This is a foolish man without merit Good to be sent on errands
Is it fitting that With the world divided into three parts he should be One of the three to share it
You thought so And took his side when we decided who should die In our black punishment and condemning to death
And although we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of different disgraceful burdens He shall only carry them as the donkey carries gold Groaning and sweating under the load Either led or driven as we point the way And having brought our treasure where we choose We then unload him and let him loose Like an unloaded donkey to shake his ears And graze in the common fields
You may do what you want to But I say he's a tried and valiant soldier
So is my horse Octavius and for that I appoint him keeper of the hay
My horse is a creature that I teach to fight To wind to stop to run directly on His bodily motions ruled by my whims
Don’t talk of him Except as a property
And now Octavius Listen to great things
Let’s do so because we are on trial And surrounded by many enemies And some that have smiles in their hearts I’m afraid Are capable of millions of evil deeds
Stop oh
He’s close by and Pindarus has come To bring you greetings from his master
How did he receive you let me be convinced
With courtesy and with respect enough Only not with such familiar instances Or with such free and friendly conversation As he used to in the old days
You’ve described A hot friend cooling off
Always note Lucilius When love begins to sicken and decay It uses a stiff cold ritual
There are no tricks in plain and simple trust But hollow men like horses very eager about something Make gallant show and promises of their spirit but when They are supposed to endure a spur that will make them Bleed they are humbled and like false worthless horses Disappear from the fight
Is his army coming
March gently ahead to meet him
Stand oh
Stop oh
Pass the word along
Stop
Stop
Stop
Most noble brother you have done me wrong
Judge me you gods
Do I wrong my enemies
And if that’s not true how should I wrong a brother
Brutus this sober face of yours hides wrongs And when you do them  Cassius please
Pindarus Ask our commanders to lead their men a little Away from this place
That you’ve wronged me shows in this action You’ve condemned and punished Lucius Pella For taking bribes from the Sardians here And my letters taking his side Because I knew the man were blown off
You wronged yourself to write me letters in such a case
In such a time as this it isn’t fair That every silly offense should uphold his criticism
Let me tell you Cassius you yourself Are much condemned for being greedy To sell and advertise your offices To unworthy people for gold
I’m greedy
Thank your stars that you’re Brutus that speaks This way or by the gods this speech would be your last
The name of Cassius honors this corruption And for that reason punishment hides his head
Punishment
Remember March remember the fifteenth of March
Didn’t great Julius bleed for justice's sake
Shall one of us Who killed the most important man in all this world Just to support robbers  shall we now Contaminate our fingers with lowly bribes And sell the mighty positions of our great honors For so much trash as may be grabbed like this
I had rather be a dog and howl the moon Than be such a Roman
Brutus don’t scold me I won’t put up with it
Go ahead you aren’t Cassius
I am
I say you aren’t
Away skinny man
Is it possible
Listen to me because I will speak
Must I give way and room to your rash anger
Shall I be afraid when a madman stares at me
O gods you gods
Must I endure all this
All this
Yes more
Must I give in
Must I watch you
Must I stand and bend Under your short tempered mood
By the gods You’ll eat the poison of your proud temper Even if it splits you because from this day on I'll use you for my entertainment yes for my laughter When you’re spiteful
Has it come to this
For my own part I’ll be glad to learn from more capable men
You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
I said an elder soldier not a better
Did I say "better
If you did I don’t care
When Caesar lived he wouldn’t dare insult me like this
Peace peace
You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so
I wouldn’t dare
No
What not dare to tempt him
For your life you wouldn’t have dared
Don’t presume too much about my friendship I may do something that I’ll be sorry for
You’ve done what you should be sorry for
There is no terror Cassius in your threats Because I’m armed so strongly in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind Which I don’t respect
I asked you For certain sums of gold which you denied me  Because I cannot raise any money by dirty means
Was that rejection done like Cassius
Should I have answered Caius Cassius if he asked me
When Marcus Brutus grows so greedy as To engage his friend in such battles Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts Cut him into pieces
I didn’t deny you
You did
I didn’t
He was only a fool That brought my answer back
Brutus has torn my heart
A friend should tolerate his friend's shortcomings But Brutus makes mine greater than they are
I don’t until you use them on me
You’re not my friend
I don’t like your faults
A friendly eye could never see such faults
A flatterer's would not although they do appear As huge as high Olympus
Come Antony and young Octavius come Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius Because Cassius is weary of the world Hated by a friend he loves threatened by his brother Attacked like a slave all his faults noted Set in a note book learned and memorized by heart To throw back into my face
Strike as you did at Caesar because I know When you hated him the worst you loved him better Than ever you loved Cassius
Put your dagger away
Be angry whenever you want to it’ll have a purpose Do whatever you want to dishonor shall be a joke
O Cassius you’re connected to a lamb That carries anger as a match makes fire Who very irritated shows a hasty spark And right away is cold again
Has Cassius lived To be only mirth and laughter to his Brutus When sadness and ill tempered blood aggravates him
When I spoke that I was ill tempered too
Do you confess so much
Give me your hand
And my heart too
Haven’t you got enough love to be patient with me When that sudden mood which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful
Yes Cassius and from here on in When you’re over aggressive with your Brutus He'll think your mother scolds and leave you alone
Let me go in to see the generals
There is some grudge between them it’s not proper That they are alone
You shall not come to them
Nothing but death shall stop me
For shame you generals
What are you thinking
Love and be friends as two such men should be Because I am older I'm sure than you
Ha ha
How this sneering fault finder rhymes so badly
Get out servant rude fellow go away
Be patient with him Brutus it’s the way he is
I'll know his disposition when he knows the right time
Away away be gone
Lucilius and Titinius ask the commanders to Prepare to pitch tents for their troops tonight
And immediately come yourselves and Bring Messala with you to us
Lucius a bowl of wine
I didn’t think you could be so angry
O Cassius I’m sick because of many sorrows
You don’t use your knowledge effectively If you give into unexpected evil events
No man handles sorrow better
Portia is dead
Ha
Portia
She’s dead
Impatient that I was gone And upset that young Octavius with Mark Antony Has made themselves so strong because that news came With the news of her death with all this she became crazy And without her attendants present swallowed fire
And died from that
Even from that
O you immortal gods
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
Fill the cup Lucius until the wine overflows I can’t drink too much of Brutus' friendship
Portia are you gone
I have letters that say the same thing
With what addition
That Octavius Antony and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred Senators By decrees of death and bills in defiance of the law
Cicero one
No Messala
And nothing in your letters was written about her
Nothing Messala
I think that’s strange
Why do you ask
Did you hear anything about her in yours
No my lord
Now as you’re a Roman tell me the truth
Why goodbye Portia
We must die Messala
I think that since she must die once I have the patience to endure it now
Even so great men should endure great losses
I have as much of this skill as you But still I couldn’t bear such new like that
Well let’s get to our work
What do you think Of marching to Philippi now
I don’t think it’s a good idea
Your reason
Good reasons must of course yield to better reasons
The people between Philippi and this field Are only our friends because we force them to Because they are unwilling to give us support
The enemy marching along with them Will increase their numbers with them and Attack refreshed reinforced and encouraged We shall cut him off from that advantage If we face him at Philippi with These people behind us
Listen to me me good brother
Excuse me
There is a tide in the affairs of men Which if taken at high tide leads to good luck Not taken all the voyages of their lives Are bound to end in shallows and in miseries
We are now afloat on such a high tide And we must take the opportunity when it presents itself Or lose our one lucky chance
The deep of night has crept over our talk And nature must obey necessity Which we will put off with a little rest
Is there anything else to say
No more
Good night
We will rise early tomorrow and be on our way
O my dear brother
This was a bad beginning of the night
Never let such disagreements come between our souls
Don’t let it Brutus
Good night good brother
Good night Lord Brutus
Where is your harp
Here in the tent
What you speak drowsily
Poor knave I don’t blame You you’ve been wake up too long
Call Claudius and some Others of my men I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent
Varro and Claudius
Calls my lord
Please sirs lie in my tent and sleep I might wake you up in a little while About business to my brother Cassius
Please we will stand here and wait for your instructions
I was sure your lordship didn’t give it me
Be patient with me good boy I’m very forgetful
Can you keep your heavy eyes open awhile And play a song or two on your harp
Yes my lord if it pleases you
It does my boy
I bother you too much but you’re willing
It is my duty sir
I shouldn’t make you do your duty past your strength I know young bloods look for time of rest
I have already slept my lord
You did well and you shall sleep again I’ll not keep you long
If you nod you’ll break your harp I'll take it from you and good boy good night
Let me see let me see isn’t the page turned down Where I left reading
Here it is I think
How badly this candle burns
I think it is the weakness of my eyes That sees this monstrous ghost
Are you some god some angel or some devil That makes my blood cold and my hair to stand on end
Tell what you are
Your evil spirit Brutus
Why do you come
To tell you that you shall see me at Philippi
Well then I shall see you again
Yes at Philippi
Why I’ll see you at Philippi then
Now I feel better you have vanished
Lucius Varro
Claudius
The strings my lord are false
My lord
Were you dreaming Lucius that you cried out like that
My lord I don’t know that I did cry
Yes you did
Did you see anything
Nothing my lord
My lord
My lord
Sirs why did you cry out like that your sleep
Did we my lord
No my lord I saw nothing
Nor I my lord
I’ll do that my lord
Now Antony our prayers are answered
You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions
Turns out to be untrue their battles are nearby
They mean to warn us here at Philippi Answering us before we demand answers of them
Nonsense I’m in their hearts and I know Why they do it
They could be content To go to other places and come down With fearful bravery thinking that by this face To impress our minds they have courage But it’s not true
Prepare yourselves generals
The enemy comes on in a show full of noble daring Their bloody sign of battle is hung out And something has to be done immediately
Octavius lead your battle quietly on On the left hand of the even field
I will be on the right hand you keep to the left
Why do you cross me in this command
I don’t cross you but I will
They stop and want to talk
Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle
No Caesar we will respond to their attack
Stay here the generals want to talk
Don’t move until the signal
Words before blows
Is that the way it is countrymen
Not because we love words better as you do
Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart Crying "Long live
Not stingless too
O yes and soundless too Because you’ve stolen their buzzing Antony And very wisely threaten before you sting
You showed your teeth like apes and wagged your tails Like hounds and bowed like slaves kissing Caesar's feet While damned Casca like a wild dog struck Caesar From behind on the neck
Come come the reason
If arguing makes us sweat The proof of it will turn to redder drops
Never until Caesar's thirty three wounds Are well avenged or until another Caesar Has added slaughter to the sword of traitors
Caesar you cannot die by traitors' hands Unless you bring them with you
I hope so I was not born to die on Brutus' sword
O if you were the noblest of your strain Young man you could not die more honorably
A peevish schoolboy worthless of such honor Joined with a man in a mask and a party man
Old Cassius be still
If you dare to fight today come to the field If not come when you’ve got stomachs
Why now blow wind swell seas and swim ships
The storm is coming up and everything is at stake
Oh Lucilius
Listen may I have a word with you
My lord
Messala This is my birthday Cassius was born On this very day
Give me your hand Messala
You be my witness that against my will As Pompey was I am compelled to set All our liberties on one battle
You know that I strongly held Epicurus And his opinion
Now I change my mind And partly credit things that have been predicted
Coming from Sardis two mighty eagles fell On our former ensign and they perched there Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands Who were associated with us here in Philippi
This morning they have fled away and are gone And in their places ravens crows and kites Fly over our heads and look down on us As if we were sickly prey
Their shadows seem like A killing canopy under which Our army lies ready to surrender
Don’t believe it
I only believe part of it Because my spirit is fresh and I am resolved To meet all perils very constantly
Even like that Lucilius
Now most noble Brutus The gods are friendly today so that we may Friends in peace increase our days to old age
But since the affairs of men still seem uncertain Let's think about the worst that can happen
If we lose this battle then this is The very last time we shall speak together
What are you determined to do then
Even by the rule of that knowledge By which I blamed Cato for his suicide  I don’t know why But I think it’s cowardly and vile to take Your own life because of the fear of what might happen  Arming myself with the patience To wait for the help of some high powers That govern us here below
Then if we lose this battle You’re contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome
No Cassius no
For that reason take our last eternal goodbye
Forever and forever goodbye Cassius
If we do meet again why we’ll smile If not why then this parting was the right thing to do
Forever and forever goodbye Brutus
If we do meet again we'll smile indeed If not it’s true this parting was the right thing to do
Why then lead on
O that a man might know How today's business ends before it comes
away
Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills To the legions on the other side
Let them start the battle immediately because I see Only cold appearances in Octavius' part of the army And a sudden push will overthrow them
Ride ride Messala
Let all the soldiers come down
O look Titinius look the enemy flies
I have turned enemy to my own
This ensign of mine here was turning back I killed the coward and took it from him
O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early Who having some advantage on Octavius Took it too eagerly
His soldiers were destroyed While we are all surrounded by Antony
Fly further off my lord fly further off Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
Fly for that reason noble Cassius fly far off
This hill is far enough Look look Titinius Are those my tents on fire
They are my lord
Titinius if you love me Mount my horse and hide your spurs in him Until he has brought you up to the troops over there And back here again that I may rest assured Whether the troops over there are friend or enemy
I’ll be here again even with a thought
O my lord
What news
O he dismounts too
Come here servant
In Parthia I took you prisoner And then I made you swear since I saved your life That whatever I asked you to do You should attempt it
Come now keep your oath Now be a freeman and search this chest with this good sword That ran through Caesar's bowels
Pindarus shall run far from this country Where no Roman shall ever notice him
It is only change Titinius because Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power As Cassius' armies are by Antony
These tidings would comfort Cassius very well
Where did you leave him
All very upset With Pindarus his slave on this hill
Isn’t that he who lies on the ground
He doesn’t lie like the living
O my heart
Isn’t that he
Our day is gone Come clouds dews and dangers our deeds are done
Lack of trust in my success has done this deed
Lack of trust in good success has done this deed
O Mistake soon conceived You never come to a happy birth Only kill the mother that had you
What Pindarus
Where are you Pindarus
Find him Titinius while I go ahead to meet The noble Brutus thrusting this report Into his ears
I may say thrusting it Because piercing steel and poison darts Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As the news of this sight
Didn’t I meet your friends
And didn’t they Put this wreath of victory on my brows And told me to give it you
Didn’t you hear their shouts
Alas you’ve misunderstood everything
But wait take this garland for your head
Come Cassius' sword and find Titinius' heart
Where where Messala does his body lie
Behold over there and Titinius’ mourning it
Titinius' face is upward
He’s slain
O Julius Caesar you’re mighty yet
Your spirit walks abroad and turns our swords Into our own guts
Brave Titinius
Look whether he has crowned dead Cassius or not
Yet countrymen O still hold up your heads
What bastard doesn’t
Who will go with me
And I’m Brutus Marcus Brutus Brutus my country's friend know me as Brutus
O young and noble Cato are you down
Why now you die as bravely as Titinius And may be honored being Cato's son
Yield or you die
But I yield to die
There is so much money if you’ll kill me now Kill Brutus and be honored in his death
We must not
A noble prisoner
Room oh
Tell Antony Brutus is taken
I'll tell the news
Where is he
Safe Antony Brutus is safe enough
When you do find him or alive or dead He’ll be found like Brutus like himself
This isn’t Brutus friend but I assure you A prize no less worthy
Keep this man safe Give him all kindness I would rather have Such men as my friends than enemies
Go on And see whether Brutus is alive or dead And bring us word how everything happened To Octavius' tent
Come poor remains of friends rest on this rock
Statilius showed the torchlight but my lord He didn’t come back
He’s or taken or slain
Sit down Clitus
Slaying is the word It is a deed that’s in style
Listen Clitus
What I my lord
No not for all the world
Peace then
I'd rather kill myself
Listen Dardanius
Shall I do such a deed
O Dardanius
O Clitus
What wicked request did Brutus make to you
To kill him Clitus
Look he meditates
Now that noble vessel is so full of grief That it runs over even from his eyes
Come here good Volumnius listen to a few words
What do you say my lord
I know I’m going to die
Not so my lord
No I’m sure of it Volumnius
Good Volumnius You know that we two went to school together Even because that our love of old please Hold my sword handle while I run into it
That's not a job for a friend my lord
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony Shall get by this evil conquest
So goodbye now because Brutus' tongue Has almost ended his life's story
Night hangs on my eyes my bones that have only Labored to attain this hour want to rest
Fly my lord fly
Away
You’re a fellow of a good respect Your life has some smack of honor in it
Hold my sword then and turn away your face While I run on it
Will you Strato
Give me your hand first
Goodbye my lord
Goodbye good Strato
What man is that
Yes if Messala will recommend me to you
Do so good Messala
How did my master die Strato
I held the sword and he ran into it
Octavius then take him to follow you Who did the latest service to my master
This was the noblest Roman of them all
All the conspirators except him Did that they did out of jealousy of great Caesar Only he in a general honest thought And common good to all made one of them
When should the three of us meet again
In thunder lightning or in rain
When all the uproar is over When the battle has been lost and won
That will be before sunset
Where should we meet
Upon the heath
That’s where we’ll meet with Macbeth
The old toad is calling me
In a minute
Beautiful is disgustingly filthy and disgustingly filthy is beautiful
Let’s float through the fog and filthy air
What man is that with blood all over him
From the looks of him he can tell us the latest news Of the revolt
This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought Against my being taken prisoner
Hail brave friend
Tell the king what you know about the battle When you left it
The outcome was doubtful Men fought like tired swimmers who cling together And wind up choking
O valiant cousin
Worthy gentleman
Just as when the sun rises and Shipwrecking storms and terrible thunder stop So from that man who seemed to bring comfort Discomfort got worse
Our captains Macbeth and Banquo Were not upset by this
Yes As sparrows are by eagles or the hare is by the lion
Whether they meant to bathe in fresh bleeding wounds Or create another Crucifixion scene I cannot tell
Your words suit you as your wounds do They both tell of honor
Who’s this coming here
The worthy Baron of Ross
He looks as though he’s in a great hurry
He look should look that way with so many strange things To say
God save the King
Where have you come from worthy baron
From Fife great king Where the Norwegian banners insult the sky And like a fan make our people cold
Great happiness
Then Sweno Norwegian king wanted a treaty We would not agree to the burial of his men Until he paid us at Saint Colme's island Ten thousand dollars to our general use
That Baron of Cawdor shall no longer betray Matters close to our heart
Order his death immediately And with the traitor’s former title greet Macbeth
I'll see it is done
What the traitor has lost noble Macbeth has won
Where have you been sister
Killing pigs
Sister where were you
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap And munched and munched and munched
Give me" said I
the fat sloppy woman cries
I'll give you a wind for your sail
You are kind
And I will give you another one
Though his ship will not be lost It will be tossed about on the rough ocean
Look what I have
Show me show me
A drum a drum
Macbeth does come
Quiet
The charm’s going to bring things to a head
I have never seen a day that is so disgustingly filthy and beautiful
How far is it to the town of Forres
What are these things With shrunken skin and wild clothes That don’t look not like they live on earth Only are still on it
Are you alive
Or are you any thing That man may question
You seem to understand me Since you each are laying a scrawny finger Upon your skinny lips
You should be women Only since you have beards I can’t say That you are women
All hail Macbeth
Hail to you Baron of Glamis
All hail Macbeth
Hail to you Baron of Cawdor
Good sir why are you startled and seem afraid of Things that sound so beautiful
In the name of truth Are you fantastic beings or indeed what You look like
You greet my noble partner With current grace and great predictions Of having nobility and of the hope to be king that he seems carried away as well
Only you don’t speak to me
If you can look into the future And say what will happen and what will not Then speak to me who doesn’t beg or is afraid of Your favors or your hateful spells
Hail
Hail
Hail
You will be less than Macbeth and much greater
Not as happy as Macbeth only still much happier
Your sons will be kings even though you will not be king
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
Banquo and Macbeth all hail
Wait you incomplete speakers tell me more
By inheritance I know I am Baron of Glamis Only how am I Baron of Cawdor
The Baron of Cawdor lives A prosperous gentleman and for me to be king Is beyond belief No more than to be Baron of Cawdor
or why You interrupt our journey on this blasted heath With such prophetic greeting
Speak I command you
The earth has bubbles as boiling water has And these spirits are like that
Where did they vanished to
Into the air and what seemed solid melted Like breath into the wind
I wish they had stayed
Are you sure we’re talking about what we’ve seen here
Or have we eaten some plant root That makes us hallucinate
Your children shall be kings
You shall be king
Yes in just those words
Who's here
Silenced with that story And reviewing all the events of the day He found you in the stout Norwegian’s ranks Not afraid of what you did or the Strange images of death
The reports came in As thick as hail and every one of them sang Your praises in your great defense of the kingdom And poured such praises down before the King
We are sent from our royal master To give you thanks Only to bring you announced into his sight Not just pay you for your brave deeds
And for as the first installment of a greater honor He ordered me from him to call you Baron of Cawdor
I was also ordered to add hail most worthy baron For the title of Baron of Cawdor is yours
What can the devil speak the truth
The Baron of Cawdor lives
Why do you address me By his name
The man who was the Baron still lives Only lives that life which he deserves to lose Under the death penalty
I don’t know whether he combined Forces with those of Norway or aided the rebel With hidden help and supplies or that with both He labored to overthrow his country's government Only his treasons punishable by death confessed and proven have caused his downfall
Aside
The greatest hurdle is behind me
Thanks for your pains
Don’t you hope your children shall be kings When those things that gave the Baron of Cawdor to me Promised no less to your children
That my best friend Might still inflame you with passion for the crown In addition to the title of the Baron of Cawdor
Aside
Aside
This supernatural meeting Can’t be bad only it can’t be good either
If it’s bad Why has it given me promise of success That began with a truth
I am Baron of Cawdor
If it’s good why do I give in to that suggestion Whose horrid image makes my hair stand on end And makes my heart pound so hard they knock at my ribs Against my will to stay calm
Look how our partner's in such deep thought
Aside
If luck wants me to be king luck may crown me Without my doing anything at all
Aside
Let whatever’s going to happen happen
Time and happiness can run through the roughest day
Worthy Macbeth we are waiting for you
Kind gentlemen every day I turn The page your pains are registered where I can read them
Let’s go see the King
Let’s think about what has happened and later When we’ve had a chance to think let’s about these things openly each to other
Very gladly
Until then enough
Come friends
Is the execution of Cawdor carried out
Haven’t Those in charge of it returned yet
My King They haven’t come back yet
Only I have spoke With someone who saw him die and he reported That he confessed his treasons very frankly He begged your highness for pardon and he seemed Very sorry
Nothing he did in his life Became him so much like the leaving it he died As someone one who had studied his own death To throw away the dearest thing he owned As it were a careless trifle
O worthiest cousin
The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me
You are so far ahead That swiftest way of repaying is slow To overtake you
I wish you had deserved less Then the greater proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been my
I can only say that You are due more than all of us can ever pay
In doing the service and the loyalty I owe you I am well paid
Welcome here
I have begun to nurture your career and will labor To make the most of yourself
Noble Banquo Who has deserved no less and must not be known To have done less than Macbeth let me infold you In my arms and stop you to my heart
If I grow here in your favor The harvest is yours
My generous welcomes Childishly cruel in being so perfect seek to hide themselves In tears
We will go from here to Inverness And then we will bind us further to you
My worthy Cawdor
Aside
I must fall down on that Step or jump over it For it’s in my way
True worthy Banquo
He is so full of courage And his commendations are food for me A banquet to me
Let’s go after the man Whose has gone before us to bid us welcome
They met me on the day we won the battle and I have learned by the most perfect report that they have more in them than mortal knowledge
When I burned in desire to question them further they made themselves vanish into thin air
Only I’m afraid your nature It is too full of the milk of human kindness To a shortcut to power
You could be great You are not without ambition only without The drive should usually goes with it
The king comes here tonight
You’re crazy to say that
Isn’t your master with him
One of my friends traveled with him Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more breath To deliver his message
See to his needs He brings great news
The raven himself is hoarse With croaking about the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my castle walls
Come you spirits That hear mortal thoughts take away my womanhood And fill me from my head to my toes full Of most terrible cruelty
Make my blood thick Stop up the ways remorse can get into and leave my body That no feelings of guilt Keep me from what I intend to do or put guilt between The consequences and the deed
Come to my woman's breasts And make my milk poisonous you murdering ministers Wherever in your blind shadows You wait on human mischief
Worthy Cawdor
Greater than both by the all hail hereafter
Your letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present and I now feel The future in the instant
My dearest love Duncan comes here tonight
And when does he leave
Tomorrow as he intends
O the sun shall never See that tomorrow
Your face my baron is like a book where men May read strange matters
We’ll have to speak more
The air Smells light and sweet To our gentle senses
The temple haunting martlet this bird of summer Approves this place by his loved dwelling places That heaven's breath smells wooingly here
I have observed that the air is delicate In areas where they frequently breed and visit
See see our honored hostess
The love that follows us sometimes is our trouble Which are still grateful for as love
Herein I will teach you How you shall bid God to reward us for your pains And thank us for your trouble
All our service If done twice in every point and then done double Would be poor and single business to compete With those honors deep and broad that Your majesty heaps upon our house
For those of old And the recent titles heaped on them We remain your hermits
Where's the Baron of Cawdor
Only he rides well And his great love of us as sharp as his spur has helped him To get to his home before us
Beautiful and noble hostess We are your guests tonight
Your servants always Have their necessities themselves and what they own in elegance To make their reckoning of accounts at your highness' pleasure Still to return your own goods
Give me your hand Take me to my host
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him
With your permission hostess
If this deed were done when it is done then it would be better If it were done quickly
This balanced justice Returns the ingredients of the gold cup we poisoned To our own lips
He has almost finished supper
Why did you leave the dining hall
Has he asked for me
Don’t you know he has
Was the hope you dressed yourself in Drunk
Did it go to sleep it off
And does it wake up now hung over From what it so freely committed to
I will calculate your love From this time forward
Are you afraid To be the same man in reality As the one you wish to be
Would you have the crown Which you believe to be the ornament of life And yet live like a coward in your own self esteem Letting "I shouldn’t" wait for "I would" Like the poor cat in the proverb
Pray you peace
I dare to do all that may become a man Who dares to do more is not a man
What beast was it then That made you tell me about this plan
When you “dared” to do it then you were a man And in order to be more than what you are you would Be so much more the man
They have made themselves agree and that agreement now Doesn’t agree with you
If we should fail
We fail
Only dig deep for your courage And we'll not fail
When Duncan is asleep Which should be soon since he is very tired From his day's hard journey I will go to his two chamberlains With wine and carousing so Their memory the guardian of the brain Will be a wisp of smoke and the tired brain won’t Be able to think clearly
Who will bear the guilt For our great slaughter
Only give birth to male children For your unconquered spirit should be passed on Only to males
Won’t it be understood When we have marked those sleepy two Of his own chamber with blood and used their very own daggers That they have done it
How’s your night going boy
The moon goes down at twelve
I think it’s later than that sir
Stop take my sword
You take that too
A serious calling lies on me like lead And still I couldn't sleep
Merciful powers Hold me back from the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to when we sleep
Give me my sword
Who's there
A friend
What sir not in bed yet
The king's in bed
Being unprepared Our wishes became the servants to what we lacked Which has worked out very well
All's well
Whenever you like
If you agree with my opinion when it is time It’ll be more honor for you
Good rest in the meantime
Go tell your mistress that when my drink is ready She should ring the bell
Get to bed
Is this a dagger which I see before me The handle pointed toward my hand
Come let me clutch you
I don’t hold you and yet I still see you
Are you fatal vision as insensitive To feeling as you are to sight
Or are you only A dagger of the mind a false creation Proceeding from the brain oppressed by heat
I still see you in form as evident to my touch As the one I now draw
You guide me on the way that I was going And show me the instrument I was to use
My eyes are made the fools of by the other senses Or else my eyes are worth all the rest
I still see you And I see great large clots of blood on your blade Which were not there before
Sure and firm set earth Don’t hear my steps which ever way they walk for fear Your very stones disclose my whereabouts And take the current horror from the time Which now suits it
While I threaten he lives Words give breath to the heat of deeds that are too cold
I go and it’s done the bell invites me
Don’t hear it Duncan for it is a sorrowful omen of death That summons you to heaven or to hell
Listen
Peace
It was the owl that shrieked the fatal bellman That gives even the worst dispositions a good night
The doors are open and the grooms filled to excess Defy their duty with snores
Who's there
What hello
The attempt and not the deed Confuses us
Listen
If the King hadn’t resembled My father as he slept I would’ve done it
My husband
I have done the deed
Didn’t you hear a noise
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
Didn’t you speak
When
Now
As I came down
Yes
Listen
Who’s in the second chamber
Donalbain
This is a sorry sight
There are two in the same room
Only why couldn’t I say "Amen"
I really needed blessing and the "Amen" Stuck in my throat
I heard a voice cry "Sleep no more
Why worthy baron You weaken your noble strength to think About things in such a crazy way
Go get some water And wash this filthy witness from your hands
Why did you bring these daggers from the room
They must lie there
Go carry them and smear The sleepy guards with blood
Weak of purpose
Give me the daggers
If he bleeds I'll smear the faces of the grooms with it Because it must seem that they are guilty
Who is that knocking
What’s wrong with me that every noise makes me jump
What kind of hands are these
Ha they pluck out my eyes
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand
No my hand will rather Redden the many seas Making the green one red
My hands are the same color as yours only I would be ashamed To have such a white heart
Let’s go to our bedroom
Your fortitude Has left you alone
Listen more knocking
Get on your nightgown in case we are called by chance And it shows us to be watchers
Don’t be lost So badly in your thoughts
To know my deed it’s best not know myself
I wish you could
Here's loud knocking indeed
If a man were answering the doors of hell he would grow old turning the key
Knock knock knock
Who's there in the name of the Devil
It must be a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of a large crop
Knock knock
Who's there in the other devil's name
Truly it must be a liar who could swear on both sides of the scale against either side who committed treason enough for God's sake yet couldn’t lie to heaven
O come in liar
Knock knock knock
Who's there
Truly it must be an English tailor sent here for skimping on the fabric for a pair of a French hose
Come in tailor here you may roast your goose
Knock knock
Never quiet
What are you
But this place is too cold for hell
I'll be a devil porter no further
I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire
In a minute in a minute
I beg you remember the porter
Was it so late friend before you went to bed That you overslept
What three things does drink especially instigate
By Mary sir nose painting sleep and urine
I believe drink gave you the lie last night
That it did sir in the very throat of me only I paid him back for his lie and I think being too strong for him though he knocked me off my feet a few times I still made a joke to throw him off
Is your master awake yet
Good morning noble sir
Good morning to you both
Is the king awake yet worthy baron
Not yet
I'll bring you to him
I know this is a joyful trouble to you It is still only one
The labor we delight in cures pain
This is the door
I'll make so bold to call Because it is my limited service
Does the king leave here today
The night has been unruly
It was a rough night
I can’t remember there being another Like it
O horror horror horror
Tongue nor heart Cannot comprehend or name you
What's the matter
What's the matter
Confusion has now made his masterpiece
Most unholy murder has broken open The Lord's anointed temple and then stolen The life of the building
What are you saying
The life
Mean you his majesty
Approach the chamber and destroy your sight With a new monster to turn you to stone
Awake awake
Ring the alarms bell
Murder and treason
Banquo and Donalbain
Shake off this soft sleep death's disguise And look on death itself
Go up go up and see The great destruction's image
Malcolm
Banquo
Rise up as you would from your graves and walk like spirits To see this horror
What's happened That such a hideous trumpet calls to summon The sleepers of the house
Speak speak
O Banquo Banquo
Our royal master's murdered
Woe alas
What in our house
Too cruel any where
Dear Duff I beg you contradict yourself And say it is not so
What’s wrong
Your royal father's murdered
O by whom
O I’m sorry I was so angry That I did kill them
Why did you it
Who can be wise amazed temperate and furious Loyal and neutral in a moment
Who could refrain That had a heart to love and in that heart Courage to make his love known
Help me here hello
Look to the lady
Why do we stop talking That most may claim we did this
What should we say her where our fate Hidden in a very small carpenter’s hole may rush up and seize us
Nor our strong sorrow Ready to be revealed
And so do I
So do we all
What will you do
Our separate journeys Shall keep us both the safer
This murderous arrow that's been shot Has not yet hit its target and our safest way Is to avoid the aim
Therefore get to your horse And let us not be too dainty in saying goodbye But only sneak away
There’s protection in the theft That steals itself when there's no mercy left
Ah good father You see the heavens troubled with man's acting Threaten his bloody stage
It’s unnatural Even like the deed that's been done
On Tuesday last A falcon towering in her pride of place Was hawked at and killed by an owl that usually eats mice
And Duncan's horses a thing most strange and certain Beautiful and swift the darlings of their race Turned wild in nature broke their stalls flew out Rebelling against obeying their masters as if they would make War with mankind
It is said they ate each other
They did to the amazement of my eyes That saw it
Here comes the good Macduff
How is the world going now sir
Why don’t you see it
Is it known who did this more than bloody deed
Those guards that Macbeth has slain
Alas the day
What good could they claim
Also against nature
Thriftless ambition that will plunder Your own life's means
Then it is most likely that The crown will fall upon Macbeth
He is already named King and gone to Scone To be invested
Where is Duncan's body
Carried to Colme creek The sacred storehouse of his predecessors And guardian of their bones
Will you be going to Scone
No cousin I'm going to Fife
Well I’ll there
Well I hope you see things are done well there adieu
Farewell father
God's blessings go with you and with those That would make a good situation out of a bad one and friends of foes
If they told the truth As their speeches shine on you Macbeth Why by the truths made good on you Might they not be my prophecies as well And set up my hopes
But I’ll be quiet no more
Here's our chief guest
If he had been forgotten It would have been a gap in our great feast And unbecoming to us
Tonight we host a solemn supper sir And I'll request your presence
Let your highness Command me to whom my duties Are joined forever with a most unbreakable tie
Are you going riding you this afternoon
Yes my good lord
We would have desired your good advice Which still has been both serious and favorable In this day's council but we'll do it tomorrow
Are you riding far
As far my lord as will fill up the time between this meeting and supper
If my horse doesn’t ride better I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or two
Don’t forget to come to our feast
My lord I won’t
We hear our bloody cousins are living In England and in Ireland not confessing Their cruel murder of their father only filling their hearers With strange lies
But more of that tomorrow When together with that matter we will have political issues That need us jointly
Is Fleance going with you
Yes my good lord
It’s time we were going
I wish your horses are swift and sure of foot And so go on for your ride
Farewell
Until then God be with you
Servant a word with you
Are those men Waiting for us
They are my lord outside the palace gate
Bring them before us
To be king in this way is nothing Only to be safely king in this way matters
Our fears of Banquo Stick deep and there’s a lot to be afraid of in the royalty of his nature
He has the courage to do a lot And in that unconquerable temper of his mind He has a wisdom that guides his courage To act in safety
If the prophecy is true I have defiled my soul for Banquo's sons I have murdered the gracious Duncan for them Put doubts and bitter feelings into my mind Only for them and I have given my soul To the common enemy of man just To make them kings the sons of Banquo kings
Rather than see that happen come Fate into the arena And fight for me to the death
Who's there
Now go to the door and stay there until we call
Wasn’t it yesterday we spoke together
It was so please your highness
Well then now
You know He was the one in the times past who held you back from promotion and you thought it was our innocent self
I did so and I went even further which is now the point of our second meeting
Are you so patient that you can let this go
Are you such believers in the gospel that you would pray for this good man and for his children the same man whose heavy hand has led you to death and made your families beggars
We are men my liege
Yes you certainly could pass for men In the same way that hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs Shoughs water rugs and demi wolves are All the names of dogs
I am one my liege Whom has been so angered by the vile blows and beatings of the world That I am reckless in what I would do to spite the world
And I am another one So weary with disasters so unlucky That I gamble my life on any chance I can get Either to make it better or end it
Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy
True my lord
And he’s mine too and to a such bloody degree That every minute of his being puts A big knot in my stomach and though I could Sweep him from my sight with barefaced power And bid my will guarantee it I can’t do it Because certain friends that are both his and mine Whose loves I may not lose would only protest his fall Who I myself struck down
And so it is That I ask see your assistance
We shall my lord Perform what you command us
Though our lives   Your spirits shine through you
I'll come to you in a minute
We are resolved my lord
I'll call upon you in a minute
Stay within
Banquo your soul's flight If it finds heaven must find it tonight
Has Banquo gone from court
Yes madam only to return again tonight
Tell the king that I wish to speak with him For a few words
Madam I will
Nothing’s ours all's been spent Where we got what we wanted but without content
It is safer to be what we destroy Rather than by destruction live in uncertain joy
How are you my lord
Why do you keep to yourself Making the worst imaginings your companions Thinking those thoughts which should indeed have died With the dead ones you’re thinking about
Problems with no solutions Should not be thought about
What’s done is done
Only let the order of the universe be disrupted Both the real and spiritual worlds suffer Before we will eat our meal in fear and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That wake us up nightly
It’s better to be with the dead Whom we have sent to their peace to gain our peace Than to lie on a bed torturing of the mind In a restless frenzy
Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
You must stop this
O my mind is full of scorpions dear wife
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance live
Only in them nature's copy is not eternal
There's comfort in that
Then you be happy
Before the bat has flown His hidden flight before black Hecate's summons are heard Before the dung beetle with his drowsy hums Rings the bell to end the night there shall be done A deed of dreadful note
What's to be done
I don’t want you to know dearest sweetheart Until you can applaud the deed
Come night that closes the eyes Cover the tender eye of pitiful day And with your bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great deed Which keeps me pale
Things that are bad make strong themselves by ill
So I beg you go with me
But who asked you to join us
Macbeth
He doesn’t need our mistrust since he tells us Our duties and the directions for what we have to do
Then stand with us
There are still some streaks of day in the west
Listen
I hear horses
Give us a light there hello
Then it is he the rest That are nobles Are already in the court
He is cooling off his horses
A light a light
It is he
Let’s do it
There will be rain tonight
Let it come down
O treachery
Fly good Fleance fly fly fly
You’ll get revenge later
O slave
Who put out the light
We have lost best half of our attack
Well let's go and tell Macbeth how much we did
To the first And the last a hearty welcome
Thank you your majesty
We will mingle with these people And play the humble host
Our hostess sits in her chair of state but when it’s time We will require her welcome
Say it for me sir to all our friends For my heart says they are welcome
See they greet you with their hearts' thanks
There's blood upon your face
Then it’s Banquo's
It is better with you out here than he inside the hall
Is he dead
If you did it You are without equal
Most royal sir Fleance escaped
Yes my good lord
Thanks for that
There the grown serpent lies the worm that has fled Has a nature that in time will breed venom But he has no fangs now
Get going
Tomorrow We'll speak among ourselves again
My royal lord You don’t give the toast
A good dinner for guests is more like One that’s bought rather than given if the host doesn’t make frequent toasts
With no toasts you might as well stay home because Away from home ceremony is the sauce to meat Getting together would be bare without it
Sweet remembrancer
Now may good digestion follow your appetites And health on both
May it please your highness sit
His absence sir Means he didn’t keep his promise
Will your highness Please grace us with your royal company
The table's full
Here is a place reserved sir
Where
Here my good lord
What upsets you your highness
Which one of you have done this
Done what my good lord
I beg you stay seated
The fit is momentary in a minute He will again be well
Are you a man
Yes and a bold one that has the courage to look on A sight which might shock the devil
O these outbursts and jerky shaking Impostors of true fear would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire Confirmed by her grandmother
Shame on you
Why do you make such faces
When it’s all over You only look at an empty stool
I beg you see there
Behold
Look
Lo
What do you say
Why what do I care
If you can nod speak too
If mortuaries and our graves must send Those that we bury back our tombs Shall be the stomachs of birds
For shame for shame
This ghost is more strange Than such a murder is
My worthy lord Your noble friends are missing you
I forgot
Do not muse at me my most worthy friends
I have a strange infirmity which is nothing To those that know me
Come love and health to all Then I'll sit down
Give me some wine fill my cup full
I drink to the general joy of the whole table And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss
Would he were here
To all and to him we miss And all to all
And get out of my sight
Let the earth hide you
Think of this good peers Only as a common occurrence
What man has courage to do I have courage to do
Or be alive again And challenge me to fight you in the desert with your sword
If I have the habit of shaking then proclaim that I am The doll of a girl
Here horrible shadow
Unreal mockery here
Why so Since you’ve gone I am a man again
I beg you sit still
You have disrupted the fun broken up a good party With very admirable chaos
Can such things be that Can overcome us like a summer's cloud Without puzzling us
You treat me like a stranger Unlike my usual self When I wonder now how you can behold such sights And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks When mine are blanched with fear
What sights my lord
Only go at once
Good night and better health Attend his majesty
A kind good night to all
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak
What time is it
Almost the middle of the night
What do you think about Macduff’s refusing to be At our great bidding
Did you invite him sir
I was told so But I will send
There's not one of them except for his house I don’t keep a bribed servant
I will go tomorrow (And I will go early in the morning) to the weird sisters
They shall speak more for now I am determined to know The worst by the worst means
For my own good All other problems will have to wait
I am now so far Stepped in blood that if I don’t wade in it any more It doesn’t matter if I am getting out of it or going over it
I have strange things in my head that need to be figured out Which must be done quickly before others look at them closely
You need to sleep
Come we'll get some sleep
We are still only youngsters in what we’re doing
Why how are you Hecate
You look angry
Don’t I have reason hags that you are Impudent and overbold
How dare you Trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death And I the mistress of your charms The secret contriver of all harms Was never called to offer my part Or show the glory of our art
And which is worse all you have done Has been only for a wayward son Spiteful and wrathful who as others do Loves for his own ends not for you
But you can make amends now
Get going And at the sunken place by the river Acheron Meet me in the morning
There he Will come to know his destiny
Provide your vessels and your spells Your charms and everything else beside
And that drop distilled by magic tricks Shall raise such unnatural spirits That by the strength of their deception Shall add to his confusion
He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear His hopes above wisdom grace and fear
And you all know security Is the major enemy of humans
Listen
And the right valiant Banquo was out too late Whom you may say if it please you was killed by Fleance Because Fleance fled
Men must not walk too late
Who cannot think how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father
Damned fact
How it grieved Macbeth
Didn’t he right away In pious rage kill the two delinquents That were the slaves of drink and in the thralls of sleep
Wasn’t that nobly done
Yes and wisely too Because it would have angered any heart alive To hear the men deny it
So I say He has put up with all things well and I think That if he had Duncan's sons in his prison As if it please heaven he shall not they should find What it meant to kill a father
Only peace
Because from his bold words and because he didn’t Go to the tyrant's feast I hear Macduff lives in disgrace
Sir can you tell Where he is
Malcolm Duncan’s son From whom Macbeth withholds his birthright Lives in the English court and is received By the most pious King Edward with such grace That the evil twist of fate takes nothing From his high respect
And this report Has so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war
Did he ask Macduff
Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message before he comes so that a swift blessing May soon return to our country that suffers Under a cursed hand
I'll send my prayers with him
The cat with the streaked fur has meowed three times
Three times and the hedgehog whined once
Toad that has spent Thirty one days and nights under cold stone From whose sweat a sleeping venom was gotten Boil you first in the charmed pot
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and caldron bubble
Fillet of a snake that lived in a bog In the caldron boil and bake Eye of newt and toe of frog Wool of bat and tongue of dog A black snake’s forked tongue and its cousin’s sting Lizard's leg and owlet's wing For a charm of powerful trouble Like a hell broth boil and bubble
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and caldron bubble
Scale of dragon tooth of wolf Witch's mummy a gulf like stomach Of the rough sea salt glisten Root of poison hemlock dug up in the dark Liver of Christians not baptized Gall bladder of goat and slips of pine trees Cut off the tree when the moon eclipsed Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips Finger of a baby born dead Delivered in a ditch by a prostitute Make the gruel thick and gooey
Also add a tiger's guts For the ingredients of our caldron
Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and caldron bubble
Cool it with a baboon's blood Then the charm is firm and good
O well done
How now you secret black and midnight hags
What are you doing
A deed without a name
Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches though the roaring waves Confuse sailors and sink ships Though corn on the cob be torn from its stalks and trees blown down Though castles topple on their guards' heads Though palaces and pyramids bend Their heads to their foundations though the treasure Of nature's buds tumble all together Even until destruction makes everything sick answer The questions I ask you
Speak
Demand
We'll answer
Say if you would rather hear it from our mouths Or from our masters’
Pour in the blood of a female pig that has eaten Her nine piglets and throw it into the flame With fat that has dripped From a murderer's gallows
Come high or low Yourself and duties skillfully show
Macbeth
Macbeth
Macbeth
Beware Macduff Beware the Baron of Fife
Send me away
Enough
Whatever you are for your good warning thanks You have helped my fear with your music
Here’s another More potent than the first
Macbeth
Macbeth
Macbeth
If I had three ears I'd still hear you
Why should I be afraid of you
What is this That rises like the heirs of a king And wears upon his baby brow the Golden crown of a king
Listen but don’t speak to it
That will never be
Who can move the forest bid the tree To walk away from his earth bound root
Sweet predictions good
Rebellion's head will never rise until the wood Of Birnam rise and our high placed Macbeth Shall live until his dying day the death of His own time and mortal custom
Do not ask to know any more
I will be satisfied or shamed
Deny me this And an eternal curse fall on you
Show
Show
You are too like the spirit of Banquo
Down
Your crown burns my eyeballs
Filthy hags
Why do you show me this
A fourth
Come out of your sockets eyes
What will the line stretch out to the crack of doom
Another yet
A seventh
Now I see it is true Because Banquo with his hair matted with blood smiles upon me And points at them for his
Yes sir all this is so
Only why Stands Macbeth in this way amazedly
Come sisters let’s cheer him up And show him the best of our delights
I'll charm the air to give a sound While you perform your antic round That this great king may kindly say Our duties did his welcome pay
Where are they
Gone
Let this evil hour Stand forever cursed in the calendar
Come in who ever is out there
What's your grace's will
Did you see the weird sisters
No my lord
They didn’t come by you
No indeed my lord
Let the air they ride on be infected And let all those that trust them be damned
I heard The galloping of horse
Who was it that came by
It is two or three my lord that bring you word Macduff is fled to England
Fled to England
Yes my good lord
Time you anticipate my dread deeds
The flighty purpose never is understood Unless the deed goes with it
From this moment The very first wishes of my heart shall be The firs actions of my hand
No boasting like a fool This deed I'll do before I change my mind
Come bring me to where they are
What had he done to make him fly the land
You must have patience madam
When our actions do not make us traitors Our fears do
You don’t know Whether it was his wisdom or his fear
Wisdom
To leave his wife to leave his babes His mansion and his titles in a place That he himself flies from
My dearest cousin I beg you have patience yourself
Your husband Is noble wise judicious and best knows What to do in these times
Things at the worst will cease or else return To the way they were before
My pretty cousin Blessing upon you
He has a father and yet he's fatherless
I am so much a fool that if I stayed longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort
I leave you at once
How will you live
As birds do mother
What with worms and flies
With what I get I mean as they do
Poor bird
You would never fear being caught or dying The mistakes nor the tricks
Why should I mother
Poor birds do not fall down
My father is not dead is all you’re saying
Yes he is dead
How will you do for a father
No how will you do for a husband
Why I can buy me twenty at any market
Then you'll buy them to sell again
You speak with all your wit and yet in faith With wit enough for you
Was my father a traitor mother
Yes that he was
What is a traitor
Why one that swears and lies
And are all traitors like that
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be hanged
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie
Every one
Who must hang them
Why the honest men
Then the liars and swearers are fools because there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them
Now God help you poor monkey
Only how will you do for a father
Poor prattler how you talk
Bless you beautiful dame
You don’t know me But I know you though in your state of honor
I know that some danger approaches you nearby
If you will take a homely man's advice Don’t be found here here with your little ones
Heaven preserve you
I cannot stay any longer
Where should I fly
I have done no harm
Only I remember now that I am in this earthly world where to do harm Is often praiseworthy to do good sometime Is a dangerous mistake
Where is your husband
I hope in no place so unsanctified or shamed as Where such as you may find him
He's a traitor
You lie you shag haired villain
What you egg
Young child of treachery
He has killed me mother
Run away I beg you
Let’s look for some desolate shade and there Cry our hearts out
Let us rather Stop the mortal sword quickly and like good men Climb over our down fallen country
Each new morning New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows Strike heaven on the face so that it echoes As if it felt Scotland’s pain and yelled out Like a sigh of sorrow
What you have spoken may be so perhaps
This tyrant whose only name blisters our tongues Was once thought honest
You have loved him well He hasn’t touched you yet
I am young only something You may deserve of him through me and wisdom To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb To appease an angry god
I am not treacherous
But Macbeth is
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an charge by a king
Angels are bright still though the brightest fell
Though all things disgustingly filthy would look like grace Yet grace must still look that way
I have lost my hopes
Perhaps even there where I did find my doubts
Why did you leave wife and child in that rawness Those precious motives those strong knots of love Without leave taking
I beg you Don’t let my jealousies be your dishonors Only my own safeties
You may be rightly just Whatever I shall think
Bleed bleed poor country
Great tyranny lay your foundation solid Because goodness dare not challenge you
Wear your wrongs The title is settled
Fare you well lord
I do not wish to be the villain that you may think For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp And the rich East to boot
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke It weeps it bleeds and each new day another gash Is added to her wounds
I also think that There would be hands uplifted in my defense And here from gracious England I have the offer Of goodly thousands
Only for all this When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head Or wear it on my sword my poor country Shall still have more vices than it had before More suffer and in more ways than ever before By the man who shall succeed the king
Who would that be
It is myself I mean in whom I know All the particulars of vice are so grafted That when they shall be opened black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state Will respect him as a lamb being compared With my unlimited evils
Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth
I will grant you he is bloody Luxurious avaricious false deceitful Sudden malicious smacking of every sin That has a name
Only there's no bottom none In my own evils
Your wives your daughters Your matrons and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust and my desire would overcome All international factions That did oppose my will
Better Macbeth Than such an one like me to reign over Scotland
Only don’t be afraid To take upon you what is yours
You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty And yet seem cold the time you may so deceive
We have willing dames enough so there cannot be That vulture in you to devour so many As will dedicate themselves to greatness Finding greatness so inclined
With this there grows In my most ill composed affection such A unbendable greed that if I were king I should seize the nobles’ lands Desire their jewels and their houses And my wanting to have more would be as a sauce To make me hunger more that I should start Unfair quarrels against the good and loyal Destroying them for wealth
This sin of greediness Digs in deeper grows with a more dangerous root Than summer seeming lust and it has been The sword of our slain kings
Still don’t be afraid Scotland has harvests enough to satisfy you Of your very own
All these are bearable When weighed against other graces
But I have none
I have no knowledge Of the king becoming graces such as justice verity Temperance stableness bounty perseverance Mercy lowliness devotion patience courage fortitude But I only abound In the division of each several crime Acting it many ways
No if I had power I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell Disturb the universal peace confuse All unity on earth
O Scotland Scotland
If there is any one fit to govern speak
I am as I have spoken
Fit to govern
No not to live
Your royal father Was a most sainted king the queen that bore you Oftener upon her knees than on her feet Died every day she lived
Fare you well
These evils you repeat upon yourself Have banished me from Scotland
O my heart Your hope ends here
Macduff this noble passion Child of integrity has wiped the Black scruples from my soul and reconciled my thoughts To your good truth and honor
Devilish Macbeth Has sought to win me into his power By many of these thoughts and modest wisdom keeps me From over believing haste
Only God above Deal between you and me
for even now I put myself to your direction and Take back my own detraction of myself here renounce The taints and blames I laid upon myself As strangers to my nature
I am still A virgin I have never gone back on my word Scarcely have wanted what was my own At no time broke a promise would not betray The devil to his fellow and delight More in truth than life
My first lie ever Was these things I said about myself
What I am truly Is your and my poor country's to command Where indeed before you came here Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point was coming to
Now we'll fight together and the chance of goodness Will like our necessary quarrel
Why are you silent
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once Are hard to reconcile
Well more in a minute
Is the king coming I beg you
I thank you doctor
What's the disease he means
It is called “the evil” A most miraculous work in this good king Which often since my stay in England I have seen him do
With this strange virtue He has a heavenly gift of prophecy And various blessings hang about his throne That say he is full of grace
See who comes here
My countryman but I still don’t know him
My ever gentle cousin welcome here
Now I know him now
Good God soon we’ll remove The thing that makes us strangers
Sir amen
Is the situation in Scotland the same
Alas poor country Almost afraid to know itself
It cannot Be called our mother only our grave
where nothing But who knows nothing is once seen to smile Where sighs and groans and shrieks that tear at the air Are made not marked where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy
No one hardly asks who The dead man's knell is for and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps Dying before the flowers show signs of sickness
O kinsman Too nice and yet too true
What's the newest grief
The news accuses the speaker Each minute turns up a new one
How is my wife
Why well
And all my children
Well too
The tyrant has not taken action against them
No they were well at peace when I did leave them
Let it be their comfort that We are coming there
I wish I could answer This comfort with a similar one
But I have words That would be howled out into the desert air Where hearing should not catch them
What concern are they
The general cause
Or is it a grief owned Entirely by one person
Only a mind that's honest Could share some of this woe although the main part Pertains to you alone
Don’t let your ears hate what I’m going to say forever Which will hit them with the heaviest sound That they have ever heard
Your wife and babies Savagely slaughtered
To relate the details Would be on the numbers of these murdered deer To add to your own death
Merciful heaven
What man
Give your sorrow words
The grief that does not speak Builds up softly in the heart and bids it break
My children too
Wife children servants all That could be found
And I had to be away from home
My wife killed too
I have said it
Be comforted
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge To cure this deadly grief
He has no children
All my pretty ones
Did you say all
O hell kite
All
What all my pretty chickens and their mother At one fell swoop
Revenge it like a man
I shall do so Only I must also feel it as a man
I cannot only remember such things that were That were most precious to me
Did heaven look on And would not take their side
Sinful Macduff They were all struck for you
Nothing that I am Not for their own sins only for mine Cruel slaughter on their souls
Heaven rest them now
Let this act be the stone that sharpens your sword
O I could cry like a woman with my eyes And brag with my tongue
Now you sound like a man
Come let’s go to the king our power is ready The only thing is missing is our leaving
Macbeth Is ready to fall and the powers above Show us the way
I have watched two nights with you but I can perceive no truth in your report
When was it she last walked
Since his majesty went into the field I have seen her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take out paper fold it write upon it read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed
A great disturbance in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do things as if awake
In this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say
That sir which I will not report about her
You may to me and it is most proper you should
Neither to you nor any one having no witness to confirm my speech
Look you here she comes
This is her very disguise and upon my life fast asleep
Observe her stand close
Where did she get that light
Why it stood by her
She has light by her continually it is her command
You see her eyes are open
Yes only she doesn’t see anything
What’s she doing now
Look how she rubs her hands
She’s accustomed to it to seem to washing her hands in this way
I have known her continue in this way for a quarter of an hour
Still here's a spot
Listen she speaks
I will set down what she says to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
Out damned spot
Out I say
One two why then it is time to do it
Hell is murky
For shame my lord for shame
A soldier and afeard
What need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account
Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him
Do you mark that
The Baron of Fife had a wife where is she now
What will these hands never be clean
No more of that my lord no more of that
You mar all with this starting
You have known what you should not
She has spoken what she should not I am sure of that
Heaven knows what she has known
Here's the smell of the blood still
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand
Oh oh oh
What a sigh that is
The heart is sorely perplexed
I don’t wish to have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body
Well well well Pray God it be sir
This disease is beyond my practice
Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds
Wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so pale
I tell you yet again Banquo's buried he cannot come out on his grave
Even so
To bed to bed there's knocking at the gate
Come come come come give me your hand
What’s done cannot be undone
To bed to bed to bed
Will she go now to bed
Directly
Disgustingly filthy rumors are circulating
God God forgive us all
Good night good doctor
The English power is near led on by Malcolm His uncle Siward and the good Macduff
Revenges burn in them because their dear causes Would excite a dead man To the flowing of blood and the grim alarm
We’ll meet them near Birnam wood They are coming that way
Does any one know if Donalbain be with his brother
There is Siward's son And many youths without beards which now Affirm they are beginning manhood
What is the tyrant doing
He strongly fortifies great Dunsinane
Now he feels his title Hang loose about him like a giant's robe Upon a dwarfish thief
Who then shall blame him when His own vexed senses begin to recoil and attack When all that is within him revolts against him
Well we march on To give obedience where it is truly owed
We give out the medicine for the sickly commonwealth And with him we pour into our country's purge Each drop of us
Or so much as it needs To revive the flower of royalty and drown the weeds
We march towards Birnam
Don’t bring me any more reports
I won’t be afraid Until Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
What about the boy Malcolm
Didn’t a woman give birth to him
The mind I think with and the courage I have Shall never sag with doubt or shake with fear
The devil damn you black you cream faced loon
Where did you get that cowardly look
Soldiers sir
Go prick your face and hide your fear in a red face You lily livered boy
What soldiers servant
Death of your soul
Those linen cheeks of your Are counselors to fear
What soldiers milk face
The English force so please you
Take your face out of here
I am sick at heart When I behold Seyton I say  This attack Will give me the throne forever or unseat me now
I have lived long enough
My way of life Is fallen into the dry withered yellow leaf And the things which should accompany old age Honor love obedience troops of friends I think I’ll have but instead of them I’ll have Curses not loud only deep mouth honor breath Which the poor heart would gladly deny and dare not
Seyton
What's your gracious pleasure
What other news
All is confirmed my lord which was reported
I'll fight until my flesh is hacked from my bones
Give me my amour
It is not needed yet
I'll put it on
Give me my amour
How is your patient doctor
Not so sick my lord As she is troubled with a number of illusions That keep her from resting
Cure her of that
That’s where the patient Must minister to himself
Throw medicine to the dogs I'll have none of it
Seyton send out
Doctor the Barons desert me
Come sir get going
If you could doctor analyze The urine of my land find her disease And purge it to a sound and former health I would praise you to the very echo That should praise again
You can do it I say
What rhubarb senna or other purgative drugs Would do keep these English here healthy
Have you heard of them
Bring it after me
I will not be afraid of death and ruin Until Birnam forest come to Dunsinane
Cousins I hope the days are near at hand That our homes will be safe
We don’t doubt it
What wood is this before us
The wood of Birnam
It shall be done
We can only learn that the confident tyrant Still stays in Dunsinane and will put up with Our settling down before it
Let a true evaluation of the military situation Wait until we have won the battle
Speculation only tells about their unsure hopes Only a certain outcome must settle Which direction the war will take
Here let them lie Until famine and the plague eat them up
If they were not reinforced by those troops that should be ours We might have met them boldly beard to beard And beat them backward where they came from
What’s that noise
It is the cry of women my good lord
Why was that cry
The queen my lord is dead
Out out brief candle
Life's only a walking shadow a bad actor That struts and worries about his hour onstage And then is not heard from again
It is a tale Told by an idiot full of sound and fury Signifying nothing
Gracious my lord I would report what I say I saw Only I don’t know how to do it
Well just say it sir
As I was standing my watch upon the hill I looked toward Birnam and in a minute I thought The wood began to move
Liar and slave
Let me suffer your anger if it isn’t so
Within these three miles you can see it coming I say a moving grove
I reign in my resolution and begin To doubt the lie of the fiend That lies the same as telling the truth
Fear not until Birnam wood Do come to Dunsinane" and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane
Arm arm and attack
If this which he swears does appear There is no flying from here or wasting time here
I begin to be weary of the sun And I wish the order the world were now destroyed
Ring the alarms bell
Blow wind
come ruin
At least we'll die with armor on our back
Now that we’re near enough throw the branch down And look like the men you are
Fare you well
If we only find the tyrant's forces tonight Let us be beaten if we cannot fight
Who is he That was not born of woman
Such a one I am to fear not anyone else
What is your name
You’ll be afraid to hear it
My name's Macbeth
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to my ear
No nor more fearful
You lie abhorred tyrant with my sword I'll prove the lie you speak
You were given birth by a woman
But I smile at swords laugh scornfully at weapons Brandished by man that's been given birth by a woman
The noise is that way
Tyrant show your face
If you are already slain and not by me My wife and children's ghosts will still haunt me
Let me find him fortune
And I will not beg for more
This way my lord the castle's gently surrounded
The tyrant's people fight on both sides The noble barons fight bravely in the war The day almost professes itself to be yours And little is to do
We have met with foes That fight beside us
Enter the castle sir
Why should I play the Roman fool and die On my own sword
While I see living creatures the gashes Look better on them
Turn hell hound turn
Of all men else I have avoided you
You’re wasting your efforts
Lose hope of your charm And let the genius whom you still have served Tell you Macduff was from his mother's womb Delivered by caesarean section
Curse you for telling me that Because it has intimidated my better part of man
And let these deceitful fiends be believed no more That trick us with double meanings That keep the word of promise to our ears And break it to our hopes
I will not fight with you
Then surrender you coward And live to be the center of attention of the times
Although Birnam wood did come to Dunsinane And you against me being given birth to by a woman I will still fight to the end
I throw my warlike shield Before my body
Macduff is missing and your noble son
Then he is dead
Yes and brought off the field
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth because then It will have no end
Was he wounded on the front of his body
Yes on the front
Why then he was God's soldier
If I had as many sons as I have hairs I would not wish them to a fairer death
And so his death bell is rung
Here comes newer comfort
Behold here is The usurper's cursed head
We are free
I see you surrounded by the finest nobles in the kingdom That speak my greetings by their thoughts Whose voices I want to hear loudly with mine Hail King of Scotland
Hail King of Scotland
We shall not waste time Before we make an accounting of your separate loves And make us even with you
My barons and relatives From this point forward you are earls the first that Scotland ever Named to such an honor
Really I don’t know why I’m so sad It wearies me you say it wearies you But how I caught it found it or came by it What it’s made of where it started I must find out And sadness makes me so crazy That I don’t know who I am
Your mind is tossing on the ocean Where your ships with full sails   Like gentlemen and rich citizens on the water Or as if they were in a procession of the sea  Look over the minor merchants That bow to them pay them respect As they fly by them with their woven wings
Believe me sir if I had such venture out there The better part of my thoughts would Be with my hope of their safe arrival
I’d be Still plucking the grass to know where the wind blows Looking over maps for ports and piers and roads And every object that would make me afraid of Misfortune to my ships Would make me sad without a doubt
My breath cooling my soup Would make me ill when I thought about The damage a mighty wind might do at sea
I shouldn’t see the time pass in the sands of an hour glass But I’d be thinking about shallows and sandbars And seeing my wealthy ship of war run aground Lowering her high top sails lower than her hull To sink
Even if I went to church And saw the holy building of stone I’d be thinking right away about dangerous rocks Which touching only my gentle vessel's side Would scatter all her spices across the water Spreading my silk cargo across the roaring waters And in a word one minute worth this amount of money And now worth nothing
If I had the mind To think about all this and if I lacked the mind to see That such a thing could happen wouldn’t it make me sad
But don’t tell me I know Antonio Is sad to think about his shipments
Believe me no I thank my fortune for it My cargos are not all loaded on one ship Or going to one place and my whole estate is not Based on the fortune of this present year So my shipments don’t make me sad
Not in love either
Then let’s say you are sad Because you are not happy and it’s easy to say that Because you laugh and leap and say you are happy Because you are not sad
Now looking at both sides Nature has made strange fellows in her time Some that will peep through their eyes forever And laugh like parrots at a bag piper And the others of such sour disposition That they'll never smile Although a wise old man swears that the joke is funny
I’d have stayed until I had made you happy If worthier friends hadn’t stopped me
I appreciate your concern
I see your own business needs you And you take this opportunity to leave
Good morning my good lords
Good gentlemen when are we getting together
Say when
You’re turning into strangers has it come to that
We'll wait until you’re free
My Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio We’ll leave you but at dinnertime Please remember where we’re meeting
I won’t forget
I only think of the world as the world Gratiano A stage where every man must play a part And my part is a sad one
OK we’ll leave you then until dinnertime
I must be one of these same dumb wise men Because Gratiano never lets me speak
Well keep me company for only two more years and You’ll never know the sound of your own voice
Goodbye I'll be a better talker by dinner
Thanks really because silence is only commendable In a cow’s dried tongue and in a girl who’s not for sale
Is that anything to think about now
Well tell me now about the lady The one you swore to make a secret trip to The one you promised to tell me about today
You know Antonio How much I have wasted my money By putting on a fancier appearance Than my small funds could support I don’t come to you now to ask that you Forgive my debts because my chief concern Is to make good on these great debts Which my behavior sometimes reckless And wasteful has left me broke
To you Antonio I owe the most in money and in friendship And from your friendship I have a guarantee To get rid of all my plots and intentions as to How to get clear all the debts I owe
Please good Bassanio tell me And if it is honorable as you yourself still are Be assured that my purse my person My utmost ability can be used for your benefit
When I was in school when I had lost one arrow I shot another one of identical length In an identical way with more thoughtful care To find the one I lost and by risking both I often Found both
I owe you a lot and like a willful youth I have lost what I owe you but if you will please Lend me money in the identical way That you lent me the first money I don’t doubt As I’ll be more careful to find both sums Or I’ll bring your second loan back again And just owe you thankfully for the first
You know me well and waste time here To twist a story about my friendship with examples And no doubt you insult me By questioning the limits of my friendship As if you had wasted everything I have
You only have say to me what I should do That you think I can do And I am committed to it so ask me
In Belmont there is a rich heiress And she is beautiful and more beautiful than that word She has wonderful virtues
The wide world is not ignorant of her worth Because the four winds blow in famous men who Want to marry her from every coast and her golden curls Hang on her head like a golden fleece Which makes Belmont her home a rich island in a lake And many sailors and heroes come to find her
Oh my Antonio
If I only had the means To compete with one of them I have a mind that predicts such good luck for me That I will undoubtedly be a very lucky one
You know that all my funds are invested in ships At sea I don’t have the money or goods To raise such a large sum So go out See what my credit in Venice can do for you Credit that shall be stretched even to the outer limits To supply you for your trip to Belmont to beautiful Portia
Go now and ask where money can be found And I will too and I will not object To borrowing it on my account or in my name
Honestly Nerissa my little body is weary of this great world
You would be sweet madam if your miseries were as abundant as your good fortunes are and yet for all I see they that are sick from over eating are as sick as those that starve with nothing
It’s not an insignificant happiness therefore to be well situated in regard to financial resources having more than enough comes at some time or other to old men but having a sufficient income lasts longer
Good sentences and well said
They would be better sentences if you followed them well
If knowing what to do were as easy as knowing what was good to do chapels would have been churches and poor men's cottages would have been princes' palaces
It is a good prophet that follows his own instructions It’s easier for me to teach twenty people what was good to do than to be one of that twenty and follow my own teaching
The brain may come up with laws to control society but one hot temper jumps over a cold law Madness the Youth is just such a jumper skipping over the nets of Good Advice the Cripple
But thinking this way is not the way to choose a husband for me
Your father was always a holy man and holy men have good ideas when they die so the lottery that he has thought up in these three chests made of gold of silver and of lead by means of which whoever chooses the right chest chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by the right man except the one you shall rightly love
But what warmth is there in your affections towards any of these princes that have already come to try
Yes he’s a cunning fellow indeed because he doesn’t do a thing but talk about his horse and he makes it a great attribute to his own good qualities that he can shoe him himself I am very afraid my lady his mother had an affair with a blacksmith
Then there is the Count Palatine
He doesn’t do a thing but frown as someone would say “If you will not have me choose” He hears happy tales and doesn’t smile I’m afraid he will probably be the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of rude sadness in his youth
I would rather be married to a skull with a bone in his mouth than to either of these princes
God defend me from these two
What do you have to say about the French lord Monsieur Le Bon
God made him and so let him pass for a man
In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but him
What do you say then about Falconbridge the young baron of England
You know I say nothing to him because he doesn’t understand me and I don’t understand him He doesn’t know Latin French or Italian and you will come into the court and swear that I only know a penny’s worth of English
How oddly he is dressed
I think he bought his shirt in Italy his hose in France his hat in Germany and his behavior everywhere
What do you think about the Scottish lord his neighbor
I think that he has neighborly charity in him because he borrowed a moneybox from the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able I think the Frenchman became his guarantor and it was sealed by another
How do you like the young German the Duke of Saxony's nephew
Very disgusting in the morning when he is sober and most disgusting in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast
If he offers to choose and chooses the right chest you would be refusing to perform your father's will if you refused to accept him
So for fear of the worst please set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the wrong chest because if the devil were within the chest and that temptation on top of it I know he will choose it
I will do anything Nerissa before I’ll be married to a sponge
You don’t need to be afraid lady of having any of these lords they have told me their intentions which is indeed to go back to their homes and to trouble you with no more suits unless you may be won by some other way than your father's command that getting you depends on the chests
If I live to be as old as Sibylla the witch I’ll die as pure as Diana the goddess of purity unless I am obtained by the letter of my father's will
I am glad this batch of would be husbands are so reasonable because there isn’t one of them that I am not foolishly in love with his very absence and I pray God grant them a fair departure
Don’t you not remember lady in your father's time a Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came here in the company of the Marquis of Montserrat
Yes yes it was Bassanio I think or so he was called
True madam he that of all the men that I have ever seen with my foolish eyes was the most deserving of a beautiful lady
I remember him well and I remember him worthy of your praise
How is it now
What’s the news
The four strangers are looking for you madam to say their goodbyes and there is a messenger come from a fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the Prince his master will be here tonight
If I could welcome the fifth with as good a heart as I can bid the other four goodbye I would be happy of his arrival if he has the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil I would rather he heard my confession than marry me
Come Nerissa
Three thousand dollars right
Yes sir for three months
For three months right
For which as I told you Antonio shall be obligated
Antonio shall be obligated right
Will you help me
Will you make me happy
Can I know your answer
Three thousand dollars for three months and Antonio obligated
Your answer to that
Antonio is a good man
Have you heard any suggestion to the contrary
But ships are only boards of wood sailors only men there are land rats and water rats land thieves and water thieves I mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks
Three thousand dollars   I think I may take his promise to pay
Be assured you may
I’ll be assured that I may and that I may be assured I will think it over
May I speak with Antonio
If it pleases you to dine with us
Yes to smell pork to eat in the temple that your prophet the Nazarene conjured the devil into
This is Mr Antonio
He looks like a flattering tax collector
I hate him because he is a Christian But more because in his low simplicity He lends out money free and brings down The rate of interest with us here in Venice
If I can catch him once at a disadvantage I’ll feed the ancient grudge I bear him until it’s fat
He hates our sacred nation and he abuses me Even there where merchants congregate most of the time Insulting me my bargains and my well won success Which he calls interest
Cursed be my tribe of Israel If I forgive him
Shylock do you hear me
I am debating about my present monies And by the nearest guess I remember that I cannot instantly raise up the whole sum Of three thousand dollars
What about that
Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe Will supply me
Shylock although I don’t lend or borrow By taking or by giving excess money Still to supply the urgent wants of my friend I'll break a custom
Yes yes three thousand dollars
And for three months
Well then your promise to pay and let me see
But listen I thought you said you don’t lend or borrow By charging interest
I never charge interest
Did he charge interest
No not charge interest not as you would say Directly charge interest listen to what Jacob did
When Laban and he agreed That all the lambs which were streaked and multicolored Should be given to Jacob the ewes being divided Were bred with the rams at the end of autumn And just when the rams and the ewes Were in the act of procreation The skilful shepherd peeled certain sticks And at the moment of mating He stuck them up before the fat ewes Who then conceiving did in lambing time Gave birth to multicolored lambs and those were Jacob's
This was a way to thrive and he was blest And good luck is blessing if men don’t steal it
This was an enterprise sir that Jacob worked for A thing that was not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven
Are you telling me this to make interest good
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
I cannot tell I make it breed as fast as ewes and rams
Pay attention Bassanio The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek A good apple rotten at the heart
Three thousand dollars it’s a good round sum
Three months from twelve then let me see the rate
Well Shylock shall we be indebted to you
Mr Antonio many times and often In the Marketplace you have abused me About my monies and my interest rates I still have taken it with a patient shrug Because suffering is the badge of all our tribe You call me misbeliever cut throat dog And spat on my Jewish clothes And all because of using of that which is my own
Well then it now appears you need my help Come on then you come to me and you say “'Shylock we would have money” You say so You that spit on my beard And kick me as you spurn a strange dog On your doorstep money is what you ask for
What should I say to you
Shouldn’t I say “Has a dog got money
Why look how you get angry
This was kindness
Happily in faith I'll put my seal to such a promise to pay And say there is much kindness in the Jew
You shall not put your seal to such a promise to pay For me I’d rather live in my poverty
Why don’t be afraid man I won’t default in payment Within the next two months that's a month before This promise to pay expires I expect to get a return Of three times three of the value of this promise to pay
Oh father Abraham what are these Christians Whose own hard dealings teach them to suspect The thoughts of others
Please tell me this If he should break his promise what should I gain By taking his forfeit
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man Is not so valuable or profitable either As flesh of mutton beef or goat
I say To buy his good will I extend this friendship If he will take it okay if not goodbye And for my friendship please don’t insult me
Yes Shylock I’ll put my seal to this promise to pay
Then meet me immediately at the notary's Give him directions for confirming this happy promise to pay And I’ll go and get the dollars right away Check on my house left in the care Of an unlucky rogue and I’ll be with you Soon
Hurry gentle Jew
This Hebrew will become a Christian he’s getting kind
I don’t like fair terms and a villain's mind
Come on in this transaction there can be no fear My ships come home a month before the due date
Don’t dislike me for my complexion The dark clothing of the polished sun To whom I am a neighbor and born near it
Bring me the fairest creature born in the north Where the sun’s fire hardly thaws the icicles And let’s make a cut for your love To prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
In terms of choice I am not only led By the nice direction of a maiden's eyes Besides the lottery of my destiny Doesn’t give me the right to choose voluntarily But if my father had not restricted me And controlled me by his wit to give myself As his wife to the one who wins me by that means I told you you yourself renowned Prince would then Stand as fair as any other man I have looked on yet For my affection
I thank you even for that So please lead me to the chests so I may Try my luck
By this sword  That killed the Shah a Persian prince That won three battles with Sultan Solomon  I would out stare the angriest eyes that look Outbrave the most daring heart on the earth Pluck the young sucking cubs from their mother Yes taunt the lion when he roars for prey To win you lady
But pity the time
If Hercules and Lichas threw dice to decide Who was the better man the best throw May be turned by luck to come from the weaker hand So Alcides was beaten by his boy servant And I might too with blind Fortune leading me Miss that treasure which a more unworthy man may get And I’ll die from grieving
You must take your chance And either don’t attempt to choose at all Or swear before you choose that if you choose wrong You will never to speak to me afterward About marriage so be advised
First forward to the temple after dinner Your choice shall be made
To make me blessed or cursed among men
Certainly my conscience will allow me to run from this Jew my master
The devil is at my elbow and tempts me saying to me “Gobbo Launcelot Gobbo good Launcelot” or “good Gobbo” or “good Launcelot Gobbo use your legs get going run away” My conscience says “No be careful honest Launcelot be careful honest Gobbo” or as I said before “honest Launcelot Gobbo don’t run scorn running with your heels” Well the most courageous devil tells me to pack
Go” says the devil “Away” says the devil
Master young man you please which is the way to Master Jew's
Oh heavens
This is my biological father who being more than half blind nearly stone blind doesn’t know me I’ll try to confuse him
Master young gentleman please which is the way to Master Jew's
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning but at the next turning of all on your left damn it at the very next turning turn of no hand but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house
Be God's sonties it will be a hard way to go
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot who lives with him lives with him or not
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot
No master sir only a poor man's son his father although I say it is an honest exceedingly poor man and thank God well enough to live
Well let his father be what he will be we’re talking about young Master Launcelot
Your worship's friend and Launcelot sir
But please therefore old man therefore I beg you are you talking about young Master Launcelot
Of Launcelot if it pleases you sir
Damn it God forbid
The boy was the very support of my age my very prop
Do I look like a club or a beating stick a staff or a prop
Don’t you know me father
Don’t you know me father
Sorry sir I am half blind I don’t know you
No indeed even if you had your eyes you might not know me it is a wise father that knows his own child
Please sir stand up I am sure you are not Launcelot my boy
Please let's have no more fooling about it but give me your blessing I am Launcelot your boy that was your son that is your child that shall be
I cannot think you are my son
I don’t know what I shall think of that but I am Launcelot the Jew's man and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother
Her name is Margery indeed I'll swear if you are Launcelot you are my own flesh and blood
You have got more hair on your chin than Dobbin my thrill horse has on his tail
It should seem then that Dobbin's tail grows backward I am sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him
How do you and your master get along
I have brought him a present
How do you get along now
Well well but as for me as I have made up my mind to run away so I’ll not rest until I have run some ground
My master's a very Jew
I am starving in his service you can count my ribs with your fingers
Here comes the man give the present to him father because I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer
You may do so but let it be quickly so that supper is ready by five of the clock at the latest
See these letters are delivered get the servants’ clothes made and ask Gratiano to come now to my house
To him father
God bless you sir
God have mercy what do you want with me
Here is my son sir a poor boy  Not a poor boy sir but the rich Jew's man that would sir as my father shall specify  He has a great infection sir as one would say to serve  Indeed the short and the long is I serve the Jew and have a desire as my father shall specify  His master and he God save you sir are almost like cousins  To be brief the very truth is that the Jew having done me wrong causes me as my father being I hope an old man shall frutify to you  I have here a dish of doves that I wish to give you sir and what I want is  In very brief what he asks is impertinent to myself as you sir shall know from this honest old man and though I say it though old man yet poor man my father
One of you speak for both of you
That is the very defect of the matter sir
The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you sir you have the grace of God sir and he has enough
You speak well
Well if any man in Italy has a better table that offers to swear on a book I shall have good luck
And then to escape drowning three times and to be in fear for my life with the edge of a feather bed here are simple escapes
Well if Fortune is a woman she's a good woman for this guy
Father come I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye
You have my best efforts to get everything done as you ask
Where's your master
Over there sir he’s walking
Mr Bassanio  Gratiano
I have to ask you something
You’ve got it
Mr Bassanio listen to me If I don’t put on a sober habit Talk with respect and swear only now and then Wear prayer books in my pocket look demurely No more while grace is saying hood my eyes Like this with my hat and sigh and say “amen” Use all the observances of manners As one well studied in a sad display in order To please his grandmother never trust me anymore
Well we’ll see your behavior
No but tonight is an exception you shall not judge me By what we do tonight
No that would be a pity I would beg you rather to put on Your boldest face of happiness because we have friends That offer merriment
But goodbye I have some business to see to
And I must go to Lorenzo and the rest But we’ll visit you at suppertime
I am sorry that you will leave my father like this Our house is hell and you a happy devil Robbed it of some taste of boredom
Tears exhibit my voice
Most beautiful pagan most sweet Jew
If a Christian doesn’t play the rogue and get you I am much deceived
But goodbye
these foolish drops drown my manly spirit somewhat goodbye
Goodbye good Launcelot
It’s a pity what hateful sin it is in me To be ashamed to be my father's child
If you keep your promise I shall end this strife Become a Christian and your loving wife
No we’ll slink away at suppertime Disguise ourselves at my house and return All in an hour
We haven’t made a good preparation
We haven’t spoken about the torchbearers yet
It’s nasty unless they may be skillfully ordered And I think it’s better not to be undertaken
If you will please break this up it will become clear
I know the hand in faith it’s a beautiful hand And the beautiful hand that wrote it Is whiter than the paper it’s written on
Love news in faith
Excuse me sir
Where are you going
Damn it sir to bid my old master the Jew to come to supper tonight with my new master the Christian
I have a torchbearer
Yes damn it I'll be taking care of it right away
And so will I
Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano's house in about an hour
Okay
Wasn’t that letter from beautiful Jessica
I must tell you everything
She has made a plan of How I shall take her from her father's house What gold and jewels she has What boy's suit she has ready
If the Jew her father ever comes to heaven It will be for his gentle daughter's sake And never should misfortune dare to cross her foot Unless she does it under this excuse That she is daughter to a faithless Jew
Come go with me read this over as you go Beautiful Jessica shall be my torchbearer
Quickly quickly please draw the curtain right away The Prince of Aragon has taken his oath And comes to make his choice now
Behold the chests stand there noble Prince If you choose the one that I am contained in Our marriage vows will be solemnized right away But if you fail my lord you must be gone from here Immediately without any more talking
I am required by oath to observe three things First never to tell anyone Which chest I chose next if I fail To choose the right chest I will never Court a maid to marry for my whole life Lastly if I do fail in choosing the right chest I will leave you immediately and be gone
Everyone swears to these conditions Who come to take a chance for my worthless self
What says the golden chest
Ha
Let me see “Who chooses me shall gain what many men desire” What many men desire
that “many” may mean The foolish multitudes that choose by outward appearance Not learning any more than their loving eyes teach Which doesn’t go to the inside but like the marten Builds on the outside wall in any weather Even in the force of wind and on the road to ruin
I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank myself with the barbarous multitudes
that fortunes degrees and offices Were not earned by corruption and that clear honors Were purchased by the merit of the wearer
Well to my choice “Who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves” I will assume I am deserving
Give me a key for this And instantly unlock my fortunes here
That’s too long a pause over what you find there
What's here
The portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a piece of paper
I will read it
This doesn’t look very much like Portia
Is that my prize
Is my deserving no better than that
To insult and judge are different things And of opposite natures
What is this here
Sweetheart goodbye
I'll keep my oath Patiently to deal with my anger
In this way the candle has burned the moth
Oh these deliberate fools
When they choose They have the wisdom to lose by their senses
Where is my lady
I’m here what do you want
No more please I am half afraid You will now say he is related to you You spend such so many words in praising him
Come come Nerissa because I long to see Quick Cupid's messenger that comes so politely
Bassanio lord Love if it is your will
Well you shall see your eyes shall be your judge The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio  What Jessica You won’t eat like a glutton As you have done with me What Jessica  And sleep and snore and tear clothes apart  Why Jessica I say
Why Jessica
Who called for you
I didn’t call for you
You sir always told me I couldn’t do anything without bidding
Did you call
What is it
I am very reluctant to go There is some ill disturbing my rest Because I dreamt of moneybags tonight
Please sir go my young master expects your insult
So I expect his
And they have conspired together I’ll not say you shall see a party but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose started bleeding on last Black Monday at six o'clock in the morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four years in the afternoon
What
are there parties
Listen to me Jessica Lock up my doors and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the long necked pipe Don’t run up to the windows then Or thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnished masks But stop my house's ears  I mean my windows Don’t let the sound of shallow foolishness enter My sober house
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring huh
His words were “Goodbye mistress” nothing else
Goodbye and if my fortune is not crossed I have lost a father and you a daughter
This is the house where Lorenzo Wanted us to wait
He’s almost late
And it’s a wonder that he’s late Because lovers always keep ahead of the clock
That’s true who gets up from a feast With the same hunger that he had when he sat down
Where is the horse that retraces his boring steps again With the same fire That he walked them in the first place
All things that exist Are sought for with more spirit than the spirit to enjoy them
How the sailing ship leaves her native port Like a youngster or a spendthrift Hugged and embraced by the prostitute wind
How she returns like the spendthrift With weather beaten sides and ragged sails Thin torn and destitute by the prostitute wind
Here comes Lorenzo more about this later
Sweet friends I’m sorry I’m late Not I but my affairs have made you wait When you are ready to do anything to get wives I'll watch as long for you then
Who's in there
Who are you
Tell me just to be sure Even though I'll swear that I know your voice
Lorenzo and your love
Lorenzo to be sure and my love indeed Because who do love I so much
And now who knows But you Lorenzo whether I am yours
Heaven and your thoughts are witnesses that you are
Here catch this chest it is worth the trouble
I am glad it’s night so that you can’t see me Because I am very ashamed of my costume But love is blind and lovers cannot see The pretty mischief that they themselves commit Because if they could Cupid himself would blush To see me transformed to a boy like this
Go down because you must be carry my torch
They in themselves to tell the truth are as light as a flute
Why light is a function of discovering things love And I should be hidden
And you are hidden sweetheart Even in the lovely garments of a boy
But come at once Because the night is running away And we are waited for at Bassanio's feast
I’ll secure the doors and cover myself With some more dollars and I’ll be with you right away
Now I swear she is a Gentile and no Jew
Curse me but I love her heartily Because she is wise if I can judge her And she is beautiful if my eyes can really see And she is true as she has proved herself And so like herself wise beautiful and true She shall be placed in my faithful soul
Who's there
Mr Antonio
where are all the rest
I am glad about it I don’t want anything more Than to get sailing and be gone tonight
One of them contains my picture prince If you choose that then I am yours as well
Some god direct my judgment
Let me see I’ll look over the inscriptions again
For lead
Gamble for lead
This chest threatens men that gamble everything Do it in hope of a better advantage A golden mind doesn’t stoop to shows of scum Then I won’t give or gamble anything for lead
What does the silver say with her virgin color
Who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves” As much as he deserves
What if I didn’t go any farther and chose right here
One of these three chests contains her heavenly picture
Is it likely that the lead one holds her picture
It’s damnation To think such a low thought it’s too gross Even to be used as her shroud in the obscure grave
Or shall I think she's enclosed in the walls of this silver one Being worth ten times less than traditional gold
Oh sinful thought
There never was so rich a gem Set in something worse than gold
There take it prince and if my picture lies there Then I am yours
Oh hell
what have we here
A skull whose empty eye has A written scroll in it
I'll read the writing
Everything that glitters is not gold Often have you heard that told Many a man has sold his life Just to look at my outside Gilded tombs wrap around worms
Why man I saw Bassanio sailing away Gratiano has gone along with him And I am sure Lorenzo is not on their ship
The law
My dollars and my daughter
A sealed bag two sealed bags of dollars Of double dollars stolen from me by my daughter
Find the girl
You’d better tell Antonio what you heard still don’t tell Him without warning because it may be too painful
A kinder gentleman does not walk on the earth
He answered 'Don’t hurry back Don’t be careless with business for my sake Bassanio But wait until your plans are realized And for the Jew's promise to pay which he has from me Don’t let it enter your mind thinking about love Be happy and use your main thoughts For courtship and such beautiful shows of love That may agree with you there” And even there his eyes being big with tears Turning his face away he put his hands behind him And with affection that was amazingly easy to feel He shook and shook Bassanio's hand and they parted like that
I think Antonio only loves the world for him
Please let’s go and find out where he is And help burn up his tangled depression With some delight or other
Let’s do it
Now what’s the news in the Marketplace
Why the rumors are all saying that Antonio has a ship of rich cargo wrecked on the narrow seas I think they call the place the Goodwins a very dangerous flat and fatal place where the dead bodies of many tall ships are buried as they say if my gossip reporter is an honest woman of her word
I wish she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband
But it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the honest Antonio Oh that I had a title good enough to keep his name company  Come the whole story
I wish it might prove the end of his losses
What’s the news among the merchants
You knew none so well none so well as you of my daughter's flight
And Shylock for his own part knew the bird was ready to fly and then it is the nature of them all to leave the nest
She is damned for it
That’s true if the devil may be her judge
My own flesh and blood to rebel
Damn it old dead man
It rebels at this age
I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood
To bait fish with if it feeds nothing else it will feed my revenge
If you stick us don’t we bleed
If you tickle us don’t we laugh
If you poison us don’t we die
And if you wrong us shouldn’t we seek revenge
If we are like you in the rest we’ll resemble you in that
If a Jew wrongs a Christian what is his option
Revenge
If a Christian wrongs a Jew what should his choice be by Christian example
Why revenge
The villainy you teach me I’ll use and it shall be hard but I’ll make the lesson better
Gentlemen my master Antonio is at his house and wants to speak with both of you
We have been up and down looking for him
Here comes another Jew we cannot Match them unless the devil himself turn Jew
Have you found my daughter
I often came to places where I heard of her but I cannot find her
Why there there there there
A diamond gone cost me two thousand dollars in Frankfort
I wish my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear I wish she were trained at my feet and the dollars in her coffin
Why you loss on loss
The thief gone with so much and so much to find the thief and no satisfaction no revenge or only bad luck stirring and sits on my shoulders no sighs except the ones I’m breathing no tears except the ones I’m shedding
Yes other men have bad luck too
Antonio as I heard in Genoa  What what what
Bad luck bad luck
has his largest ship lost coming from Tripolis
Is it true is it true
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck
Where
in Genoa
Your daughter spent as I heard one night in Genoa eighty dollars
Eighty dollars
Many of Antonio's creditors came with me to Venice swearing he can only go broke
I am very glad of it I'll plague him I'll torture him I am glad of it
One of them showed me a ring that he accepted from your daughter as payment for a monkey
Damn her
You torture me Tubal It was my turquoise ring I got from Leah my wife when I was still single I wouldn’t have traded it for a wilderness of monkeys
But Antonio is certainly bankrupt
No that's true that's very true
I’ll have his heart if he defaults because if he were out of business in Venice I can make whatever deals I want to
Go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue go good Tubal at our synagogue Tubal
I could teach you How to choose right but then I’m breaking my oath I’ll never do that you may not win me And if you don’t you'll make me wish I had sinned That I had broken my oath
Curse your eyes They have looked me over and divided me One half of me is yours the other half is also yours My own love I would say but if my love then yours And so everything yours
Let me choose Because as I am I live in torture
In torture Bassanio
Then confess What evil is there mingled with your love
None but that ugly evil of mistrust Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love There may as well be friendship and life Between snow and fire as evil and my love
Yes but I’m afraid you speak out of torture Where men will say anything
Well then confess and live
Confess” and “love” Have been the very sum of my confession Oh happy torment when my torturer Teaches me answers for escape from evil
But let me go to my fortune and the chests
He may win And what is music then
Then music is Sounds as the trumpets when true subjects bow To a new crowned king music is Those sweet sounds at sunrise That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear And summon him to marriage
Now he goes With no less confidence but with much more love Than young Alcides went to redeem The sacrifice of young women made by howling Troy To the sea monster I stand for sacrifice The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives With tear stained faces coming out to view The outcome of the event
Go Hercules
Tell me where is fancy bred In the heart or in the head How begot how nourished
Answer answer
Ding dong bell
These chests may not be what they seem outside The world is still tricked by ornament
In law what plea is so tainted and corrupt That being delivered with a gracious voice Obscures the evil underneath
In religion What damned error is there that some sober face Will bless it and approve it with a text Hiding the grossness with a beautiful ornament
There is no vice so simple that it takes on Some mark of virtue on outside
Thus decoration is only the deceived shore To a most dangerous sea the beautiful scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word The seeming truth which skillful times dress in To fool the wisest men
How all the other passions fly to the air As doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair And shuddering fear and green eyed jealousy
Oh love
What do I find here
Beautiful Portia's picture
What minor god Has come so near to making a woman
Do these eyes move
Here The painter plays the spider in her hair and has woven A golden mesh to capture the hearts of men Faster than gnats are caught in cobwebs but her eyes  How could he see to do them
You that choose not by looks Gamble as fair and choose as true
Since this fortune falls to you Be content and seek no other new one
If you are well pleased with this And hold your fortune for your bliss Turn to where your lady is And claim her with a loving kiss” A gentle scroll
Beautiful lady excuse me I come off to the side to give and to receive
Like one of two contenders for a prize That thinks he has done well in people's eyes Hearing applause and universal shout Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt Whether those peals of praise are his or not So three times beautiful lady I stand I even like this As doubtful of whether what I see is true Until it is confirmed signed and ratified by you
Madam you have made me speechless Only my blood in my veins speaks to you And I am so confused Just as there appears buzzing among a happy crowd After a well given speech By a beloved prince Where every piece blended together Turns to something wild expressed and not expressed Except for joy
But when this ring Parts from this finger then life parts from my body Oh
Then you can be strong and say “Bassanio's dead” My lord and lady now it’s our turn o cry “Good joy” We who have stood by and seen our wishes for you come true Good joy my lord and lady
My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady I wish you all the joy that you can wish for yourselves Because I am sure you can’t wish any from me And when you two mean to make The bargain of your vows solemn please Even then let me be married too
With all my heart if you can get a wife
I thank you sir you have gotten me one
Your fortune stood on the chests there And so did mine as it works out Because courting here until I worked up a sweat And swearing promises until my mouth was dry With oaths of love at last if her promise lasts I got a promise of this beautiful one here To have her love provided that you were Lucky enough to get her mistress
Is this true Nerissa
Madam it is as long as you are pleased with the rest of it
And you Gratiano are you sincere
Yes in faith my lord
Our feast shall be very honored by your marriage
We'll bet them who has the first boy for a thousand dollars
No we shall never win a bet at that sport
But who comes here
Lorenzo and his infidel
What and my old Venetian friend Salanio
So do I my lord They are entirely welcome
I thank you sir
For my part my lord I didn’t intend to see you here But meeting with Salanio by the way He begged me past all saying no To come along with him
I did my lord And I have reason for it
Mr Antonio Send you his regards
Before I open his letter Please tell me how my good friend is doing
He’s not sick my lord unless it’s in his mind But he’s not well unless in his mind his letter there Will show you his state of affairs
Nerissa cheer the stranger say hello to her
Let me shake your hand Salanio
What's the news from Venice
How is that royal merchant good Antonio
I know he will be happy at our success We are the Jasons we have won the fleece
I wish you had won the fleece that he has lost
There are some harsh contents in that letter That steal the color from Bassanio's cheeks Some dear friend is dead or nothing else in the world Could change the constitution so much Of any constant man
When I told you That I had nothing I should have told you then That I had less than nothing because indeed I have indebted myself to a dear friend Indebted my friend to his notorious enemy To feed my needs
Here is a letter lady The paper is like the body of my friend And every word in it a gaping wound Bleeding heavily
But is it true Salanio
Have all his ventures failed
What not one came in
From Tripolis from Mexico and England From Lisbon Barbary and India
And not one vessel escaped the dreadful touch Of the rocks that can break a merchant
Not one my lord
Besides it seems that even if he had The money right now to pay the Jew He wouldn’t take it
When I was with him I heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonio's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he owed him and I know my lord If law authority and power don’t deny him It will go hard with poor Antonio
Is it your dear friend that is in trouble like this
The dearest friend to me the kindest man The best conditioned and unwearied spirit In manners and one in whom The ancient Roman honor appears more Than any man alive in Italy
How much does he owe the Jew
For me three thousand dollars
What
Pay him six thousand and destroy the promise to pay Double six thousand and then treble that Before a friend of this description Loses a hair because of Bassanio
First go with me to church and marry me And then go away to Venice to your friend Because you shall never lie by Portia's side With an uneasy soul
But let me hear the letter of your friend
Sweet Bassanio my ships have all sunk my creditors grow cruel my funds very low my promise to pay to the Jew is in default and since in paying it it is impossible for me to live all debts between you and me are canceled if I might only see you at my death
Since I have your permission to go I’ll hurry but until I come back again I will not sleep And rest will not keep us two apart
Jailer look to him
Don’t tell me about mercy This is the fool that lent out money for free Jailer look to him
But listen to me good Shylock
Please listen to me speak
I won’t be made a soft and dull eyed fool To shake my head give in and sigh and surrender To Christian intercessors
Don’t follow I won’t put up with your speaking I’ll have my promise to pay
It is the most difficult to understand dog That ever stayed with men
Let him alone I won’t follow him any more with useless prayers
I am sure the Duke Will never enforce this default
The Duke cannot deny the course of law Because of the benefits that strangers have With us in Venice if it is denied it will reflect very badly on the justice of the state Because the trade and profit of the city Is from all nations
So go These griefs and losses have so upset me That I shall hardly have a pound of flesh Tomorrow give to my bloody creditor
Well jailer let’s go on I pray good Bassanio comes To see me pay his debt and then I won’t care
Madam although I’m saying it in front of you You have a noble and a true understanding Of godlike friendship which appears most strongly In your behaving like this in the absence of your lord
But if you knew to whom you give this friendship How true a gentleman you send in relief How dear a friend of my lord is your husband I know you show more pride in the work Than accustomed behavior can make you show
I never did regret doing good And I won’t now because in companions That talk and waste the time together Whose souls bear an equal burden of love There must be a sharing of things like proportion Of limbs manners and spirit Which makes me think that this Antonio Being the closest friend of my lord Must be like my lord
If it’s true How little is the cost I have paid In purchasing the image of my soul From out of the state of hellish cruelty
This sounds as if I am praising of myself So no more about it listen to other things
I don’t want you To deny this imposition Which my love and some necessity Now lays on you
Madam I shall obey you in all fair commands
With all my heart My staff already know my mind And will report to you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself
So goodbye until we shall meet again
Beautiful thoughts and happy hours attend on you
I wish your ladyship all my heart's content
Madam I go with all convenient speed
Come on Nerissa I have work in hand That you don’t know about yet we'll see our husbands Before they think about us
Shall they see us
They shall Nerissa but in such a costume That they’ll think we are finished With that we don’t have
Why shall we turn into men
But come I'll tell you all about my whole plan When I am in my coach which waits for us At the park gate and so hurry Because we must travel twenty miles today
Yes honestly because look the sins of the father are to be laid on the children so I promise you I’m afraid you
I was always honest with you and so now I speak my annoyance over the matter so be cheerful because I honestly think you are dammed
There is only one hope in it that can do you any good and that is only a kind of bastard hope
And what hope is that please
Damn it you may partly hope that your father had not fathered you that you are not the Jew's daughter
That’s a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be laid on me
Honestly then I’m afraid you are dammed both by father and mother when I keep away from the Sea Monster your father I fall into an equal evil your mother well you are gone both ways
I shall be saved by my husband he has made me a Christian
I'll tell my husband Launcelot what you say here he comes
I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if you thus get my wife into corners
I shall answer that better to the community than you can explain the swelling of the negro's belly the Moor is pregnant by you Launcelot
It is important that the Moor should be more than reason but if she is less than an honest woman she is indeed more than I took her for
How every fool can play on the word
That is done sir they have all stomachs
Goodly Lord what a wit snapper are you
Then bid them prepare dinner
That is done too sir only 'cover' is the word
Will you cover then sir
Not so sir neither I know my duty
Yet more quarrelling with purpose
Will you show the whole wealth of your wit al at once
Please understand a plain man in his plain meaning let your fellows come on bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we’ll come in to dinner
For the table sir it shall be served in for the meat sir it shall be covered for your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as sense and meaning shall determine
Oh dear judgment how his words are suited
The fool has planted in his memory An army of good words and I know Many fools that stand in a better place Dressed like him except that a tricky word Defies definition
How are you Jessica
And now good sweetheart tell me your opinion How do you like Lord Bassanio's wife
So much I can’t express it
It is very proper The Lord Bassanio live an upright life Because having such a blessing in his lady He finds the joys of heaven here on earth And if he doesn’t merit it on earth It stands to reason he should never enter heaven
Why if two gods should play some heavenly match And place a bet on two earthly women And Portia is one of them there must be something else To bet on with the other because the poor rude world Does not have her equal
You have such a husband in me As she is for a wife
No but ask my opinion too about that
I’ll ask later first let’s go in to dinner
No let me praise you while I want to
No please let it serve for dinner conversation Then no matter what you say I shall digest it with the other things I’m eating up
Well I'll point you in the right direction
What is Antonio here
Ready if it pleases your Grace
I am sorry for you you are here to answer A rock like opponent an inhuman wretch Incapable of pity void and empty Of any ounce of mercy
I have heard Your Grace has taken great pains to modify His stubborn course but since he stands solid And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach I confront His fury with my patience and I am ready To suffer the very tyranny and rage of his With a quiet spirit
Go one of you and call the Jew into the court
He is ready at the door he comes my lord
Make room and let him stand before us
Shylock the world thinks and I think so too That you only carry this kind of malice To the very last hour of action and then it’s thought You'll show your mercy and remorse more strangely Than your strange apparent cruelty is And where you now exact the penalty  Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh  You will not only loose the default But touched with human gentleness and love Forgive half of the borrowed amount Glancing with an eye of pity on his losses That have been so heaped on his back lately Enough to press a royal merchant down And get sympathy for his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of stone From stubborn Turks and Tartars never trained To uses of tender courtesy
We all expect a gentle answer Jew
You ask me why I would rather choose to have A weight of dead flesh than to receive Three thousand dollars
What if a rat troubles my house And I am happy to give ten thousand dollars To have it captured
What aren’t you answered yet
There are some men that don’t love a dead pig Some that are crazy if they see a cat And others when they hear the song of the bagpipe Cannot hold their urine because sympathy Mistress of passion persuades passion to the mood Of what it likes or hates
Are you answered
This is no answer you unfeeling man To excuse the flowing of your cruelty
I am not required to please you with my answer
Do all men kill the things they don’t love
Does any man hate the thing he wouldn’t kill
Every wrong is not a hate at first
For your three thousand dollars here are six
If every dollar in six thousand dollars Were in six parts and every part a dollar I would not take them I want my promise to pay
How shall you hope for mercy giving none
What judgment shall I dread if I have done no wrong
Let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be seasoned with such rich meats
I may dismiss this court by my power Unless Bellario a learned doctor Whom I have sent for to determine this Comes here today
My lord There is a messenger waiting outside With letters from the doctor Just now arrived from Padua
Cheer up Antonio
The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and everything Before you shall lose one drop of blood for me
Did you come from Padua from Bellario
Why do you sharpen your knife so earnestly
To cut the default from that bankrupt there
You make your knife sharp not on the sole of your shoe But on your soul harsh Jew but no metal can No not the hangman's axe be sharpened to half the sharpness Of your sharp hate
Can any prayers get through to you
No none that you have sense enough to make
Oh damn you stubborn dog
And for your life let justice be blamed
Your dog like spirit That must have been ruled by a wolf Hanged for killing a human his evil soul Falling quickly even from the gallows And while you lay in your unholy mother Sent itself into you because your desires Are wolfish bloody starved and hungry
He waits very nearby To know your answer whether you'll admit him
Please don’t let his youth be an impediment to giving him the utmost respect because I never knew so young a body with so old a head
Give me your hand do you come from old Bellario
I did my lord
You are welcome take your place
Are you acquainted with the difference of opinion That is the present question before the court
I am thoroughly informed about the case
Which is the merchant here and which the Jew
Antonio and old Shylock both come forward
Is your name Shylock
Shylock is my name
Yes so he says
Do you confess the promise to pay
I do
Then must the Jew be merciful
On what compulsion must I
Tell me that
So Jew Though justice is your plea consider this That if we all got justice none of us Would see salvation we pray for mercy And that same prayer teaches us all to do The deeds of mercy
I have spoken this much To soften the justice of your plea Which if you follow this strict court of Venice Must give a ruling against the merchant there
My deeds on my head
I want the law The penalty and penalty of my promise to pay
Is he unable to repay the money
Yes here I brought it for him into the court Yes twice the sum if that is not enough I’ll swear to pay it ten times over On penalty of the loss of my hands my head my heart If this is not enough it must seem That evil wins over truth
And I beg you Twist the law once to your authority To do a great right do a little wrong And deprive this cruel devil of his will
A prophet from the Bible come to judgment
Yes a prophet
Oh wise young judge how I honor you
Please let me look on the promise to pay
Here it’s most reverend doctor here it is
Shylock there's three times your money offered to you
No not for Venice
When it is paid according to the terms
Most heartily I beg the court To give the judgment
Why then it is like this You must prepare your chest for his knife
Oh noble judge
Oh excellent young man
Oh wise and upright judge How much more older are you than your looks
So bare your chest
It is true
Are there scales here to weigh The flesh
I have them ready
Have some surgeon nearby Shylock on your responsibility To stop his wounds so that he won’t bleed to death
Is it so stated in the promise to pay
It is not expressly stated but so what
It would be good for you to do so much for charity
I cannot find it it’s not in the promise to pay
You merchant have you anything to say
Don’t grieve that I am doing this for you Because here Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her habit it is still her habit To let the wretched man outlive his wealth To view an age of poverty with hollow eye and wrinkled brow She cuts me off from the lingering repentance Of such misery
Commend me to your honorable wife Tell her the story of Antonio's end Say how I loved you speak fairly about me in death And when the tale is told ask her to be the judge of Whether Bassanio didn’t once have a love
Only be sorry that you shall lose your friend And he is not sorry that he pays your debt Because if the Jew only cuts deep enough I'll pay it instantly with all my heart
Antonio I am married to a wife Who is as dear to me as life itself But life itself my wife and all the world Are not worth more to me than your life I would lose everything yes sacrifice them all Here to this devil to save you
Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were here to listen to such an offer
I have a wife whom I protest I love I wish she were in heaven so she could Beg some power to change this currish Jew
It’s well you offer it behind her back The wish would other make a noisy house
We are wasting time Please enforce sentence
Most rightful judge
Come get ready
Is that the law
You yourself shall see the law Because as you insist on justice be assured You shall have justice more than you desire
I take this offer then pay the promise to pay three times And let the Christian go
Here is the money
Oh Jew
an upright judge a learned judge
So get ready to cut off the flesh
Don’t shed any blood or cut less nor more Exactly just a pound of flesh if you take more Or less than a just pound whether it is only so much That makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple no if the scale turns Only by a hair You die and all your goods are seized
A second Daniel a Daniel Jew
Now infidel I have you at a disadvantage
Why does the Jew wait
Take your penalty
Give me my principal and let me go
I have it ready for you here it is
He has refused it in the open court He shall merely have justice and his promise to pay
Shall I not have just my principal
You shall have nothing but the penalty To be so taken at your own risk Jew
Why then the devil give him good of it
I'll wait no longer
It is enacted in the laws of Venice That if it is proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen The party against whom he schemes Shall seize one half his goods the other half Comes to the public treasury of the state And the offender's life lies at the mercy Of the Duke only above all others
In which predicament I say you stand Because it appears by this obvious proceeding That indirectly and directly too You have schemed against the very life Of the defendant and you have incurred The danger that I just read to you
So kneel down and beg mercy of the Duke
Beg that you may have permission to hang yourself And still your wealth being the penalty to pay the state You haven’t got the value of a string left So you must be hanged at the state's expense
Yes for the state not for Antonio
No take my life and everything don’t pardon that You take my house when you take the prop That holds my house up you take my life When you take the means by which I live
What mercy can you give him Antonio
A free rope with a nooses nothing else for God's sake
So if it pleases my lord the Duke and all the court To set the fine for one half of his goods I am content as long as he will let me have The other half to use to give it On his death to the gentleman That lately stole his daughter Two things more that for this favor He presently becomes a Christian The other that he records a gift Here in the court of everything he has when he dies To his son Lorenzo and his daughter
He shall do this or else I take back The pardon that I just pronounced here
Are you content Jew
What do you say
I am content
Clerk draw up a deed of gift
Please let me go from here I am not well send the deed after me And I’ll sign it
Go but do it
In your christening you shall have two godfathers If I had been the judge you should have had ten more To bring you to the gallows not to the baptismal font
Sir I beg you to come home with me to dinner
I am sorry that you cannot stay
Antonio thank this gentleman Because in my opinion you owe him a lot
Most worthy gentleman my friend and I Have been acquitted today Of grievous penalties by your wisdom instead of Three thousand dollars due to the Jew We will freely pay for your courteous pains
And stand indebted over and above In love and service to you forever
He is well paid that is well satisfied And I am satisfied in delivering you And therefore I consider myself well paid My mind never wanted anything else in payment
Please recognize me when we meet again I wish you well and so I say goodbye
You push me far and so I’ll give in
I’ll have nothing else except this only And now I think I have a mind to have it
There's more that depends on this ring than its value
I will give you the most expensive in Venice And find out where it is by proclamation Only for this ring please excuse me
I see sir you are free in making offers You taught me to beg first and now I think You teach me how to answer a beggar
Good sir this ring was given me by my wife And when she put it on she made me vow That I should not sell or give or lose it
That’s the excuse many men use to save their gifts
And if your wife is not a madwoman And knows how much I have deserved this ring She would not hold out in being your enemy forever For giving it to me
Well goodbye
My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring Let what he deserves and with my friendship Be measured against your wife's commandment
Go Gratiano run and catch him Give him the ring and bring him if you can To Antonio's house
Find the Jew's house give him this deed And let him sign it we'll leave tonight And be a day ahead of our husbands coming home
This deed will be very welcome to Lorenzo
My Lord Bassanio listening to more advice Has sent you this ring here and asks Your company at dinner
I can’t do that I accept his ring most thankfully And please tell him so furthermore Please show my youth to old Shylock's house
That I will do
We shall have old swearing That they gave the rings away to men But we'll confront them and outswear them too
Away
Hurry you know where I’ll wait for you
Come good sir will you show me to this house
The moon shines bright in such a night as this When the sweet wind gently kissed the trees And they made no noise in such a night Troilus I think climbed the walls of Troy And sighed his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressida lay that night
In such a night Thisbe fearfully tripped over the dew And saw the lion's shadow before the lion itself And ran away dismayed
In such a night Dido stood with a willow in her hand On the wild banks of the sea and sent her love To return to Carthage
In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That renewed old Aeson
In such a night Jessica stole away from the wealthy Jew And ran from Venice with a poor love As far as Belmont
In such a night Young Lorenzo swore he loved her well Stealing her soul with many vows of love  And never a true one
In such a night Pretty Jessica like a little witch Lied about her love and he forgave her
I would out night you if no one was coming But listen I hear the footsteps of a man
Who comes so quickly in silence of the night
A friend
A friend
What friend
Your name please friend
Stephano is my name and I bring word that My mistress will be here at Belmont Before the break of day she wanders about By holy crosses where she kneels and prays For happy marriage hours
Who comes with her
No one but a holy hermit and her maid
Please is my master returned yet
Hey hey
Whoa ha hey
Hey hey
Who calls
Hey
Hey hey
Hey
Where
where
Here
Tell him there's a letter arrived from my master with his horn full of good news my master will be here before morning
My friend Stephano let them know please Within the house that your mistress is at hand And bring your music outside
How sweet the moonlight sleeps on this bank
We will sit here and let the sounds of music Creep into our ears soft stillness and the night Compliment the touches of sweet harmony
And wake the goddess of Love with a hymn Pierce your mistress’ ear with sweetest touches And bring her home with music
I am never happy when I hear sweet music
The man that has no music in him Or is not moved by harmony of sweet sounds Is fit for treasons plots and stealing The movement of his spirit is as dull as night And his affections are as dark as the place between Earth and hell
A good deed in a naughty world shines like that
When the moon was shining we did not see the candle
A substitute shines as brightly as a king Until a king is back and then the substitute’s Condition drains away as an inland brook does Into the river of waters
Music
Listen
It is your music madam from the house
Nothing is good I see without respect I think it sounds much sweeter at night than by day
Silence bestows that virtue on it madam
The crow sings as sweetly as the lark When either is waited on and I think The nightingale if she sang by day When every goose is cackling would be considered No better a musician than the wren
The moon sleeps with her lover And does not want to be awakened
That is the voice Or I am much mistaken of Portia
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo By my bad voice
Dear lady welcome home
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare Which are moving along quickly we hope the better For our words
Have they returned
Madam not yet But there is come a messenger ahead of them To show that they are coming
Go in Nerissa Give orders to my servants that they take No notice at all of our being absent from here Nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you
We should hold day with the direct opposite If you would walk in absence of the sun
I thank you madam give welcome to my friend This is the man this is Antonio To whom I am so infinitely indebted
No more than I am well released from
A quarrel hey already
What's the matter
You swore to me when I gave it you That you would wear it until the hour of your death And that it would go with you to your grave You should have respected and have kept it Though not for me but for your intense oaths
Gave it a judge's clerk
No God's my judge The clerk will never grow a beard that took it
He will if he lives to be a man
Yes if a woman lives to be a man
Now by this hand I gave it to a youth A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy No taller than you the judge's clerk A chattering boy that asked for it as a fee I could not for my heart deny him the ring
You are to blame I must be plain with you  To part so quickly with your wife's first gift A thing stuck on your finger with oaths And so nailed with faith to your flesh with faith
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it and here he stands I would dare to swear for him that he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for all the wealth In the world
Now truly Gratiano You give your wife a cause for grief that is very unkind If it was given to me I should be angry about it
Why it would be better if I cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending it
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away To the judge that asked for it and indeed Deserved it too and then the boy his clerk That took some pains in writing he asked for mine And neither man nor master would take anything else But the two rings
What ring did you give my lord
Not the one I hope that you got from me
If I could add a lie to a fault I would deny it but you see my finger Hasn’t got the ring on it it is gone
And neither will I Until I see mine again
Sweet Portia If you knew to whom I gave the ring If you knew for whom I gave the ring And would think about for what I gave the ring And how unwillingly I let the ring go When nothing would be accepted but the ring You would decrease the strength of your anger
If you had known the virtue of the ring Or half the worthiness of her who gave the ring Or your own honor to hold the ring You wouldn’t have parted then with the ring
What man is there so very unreasonable That if you had bothered to defend it With any terms of earnestness lacked the modesty To encourage the thing be held as a ceremony
Nerissa teaches me what to believe I'll die for it but some woman took the ring
No by my honor madam by my soul No woman took it but a civil doctor Which refused three thousand dollars of me And begged for the ring which I denied him And let him go away displeased Even he that had delayed the very life Of my dear friend
What should I say sweet lady
I forced to send the ring after him I was overcome with shame and courtesy My honor would not let ingratitude So much offend it
Pardon me good lady Because by these blessed candles of the night If you had been there I think you would have begged The ring from me to give the worthy doctor
And I his clerk so be well advised How you leave me to my own protection
Well do so don’t let me take him then Because if I do I'll break the young clerk's pen
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels
Sir don’t grieve you are welcome nevertheless
Portia forgive me this forced wrong And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to you even by your own beautiful eyes That I see myself in  Listen only that
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself One in each eye swear by your double self And there's an oath to believe
No but listen to me Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear I will never again break an oath made to you
Then you shall be his insurance
Give him this And tell him keep it better than the other one
Here Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring
I got it from him pardon me Bassanio Because by this ring the doctor slept with me
And pardon me my gentle Gratiano Because that same scrubbed boy the doctor's clerk Instead of this slept with me last night
Are we betrayed before we have deserved it
I am speechless
You were the doctor and I didn’t know you
You were you the clerk that is to betray me
Yes but the clerk that never means to do it Unless he lives until he is a man
Sweet doctor you shall be my lover When I am absent then you can lie with my wife
Sweet lady you have given me life and living Because here I read for certain that my ships Have safely come home
How is it now Lorenzo
My clerk has some good comforts for you too
Beautiful ladies you drop holy bread in the way Of starved people
It is almost morning And I am still sure you are not totally satisfied About these events full
Let’s go in And ask us all your questions And we’ll answer everything truthfully
Well while I live I'll fear no other thing So much as keeping Nerissa's ring safe
Now fair Hippolyta the time for our wedding is very close Just four more happy days until the new moon
Four days will quickly dissolve into four nights Four nights will quickly dream away the time And then the moon like a silver slice in the heavens Will light the night of our wedding solemnities
Go Philostrate Stir up the young people of Athens to start swinging Get the party spirit going Turn sadness back to the funerals   No sadness at our parties
Hippolyta I got you by waging war with you And made you love me by doing you injuries But I will marry you in a different way With pomp with triumph and with partying
Regards to Theseus our renowned duke
Since she belongs to me I may dispose of her Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death according to our law Which is fit to these circumstances
What do you say Hermia
Be careful fair maid
To you your father should be as a god A god that created your beauty yes and a god Who sees you as a piece of wax that he has imprinted And it is within his power to leave the wax as it is Or to disfigure it
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman
So is Lysander
In any other case he is
I wish my father could see with my eyes
No you must see with your father’s eyes
I beg your grace to pardon me
Either to die or to swear to avoid The society of men forever
Therefore fair Hermia think about what you’re doing Think about how young you are examine your choices well Whether if you don’t take your father's choice You can endure life in a convent To be shut up in a cloister To live a childless nun all your life Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
Those who can discipline themselves to undertake Such a heavenly path for piety are blessed three times But those who are in a convent to avoid marriage Grow live and die in single blessedness
Well that’s how I will grow live and die my lord Before I will give up my virginity To his lordship
Take time to think about it and by the next new moon  The wedding day of my love and me For the everlasting bond of fellowship  On that day either prepare to die Because you have disobeyed your father's will Or else marry Demetrius as your father wants you to Or accept the austerity and single life of a nun
Give in sweet Hermia and Lysander give up Your crazy claim to my future bride
Scornful Lysander
Yes Demetrius has my approval And everything I own I will leave to him And she is mine and all my rights concerning her I leave to Demetrius
I am my lord as well born as he is As rich my love is better than his My fortunes no matter which way you look at it Are as good as Demetrius' And furthermore which is more important than all these qualities Hermia loves me too
Why shouldn’t I pursue Hermia
Demetrius I'll swear it on his head Pursued Nedar's daughter Helena the same way And won her soul and she sweet lady loves Devoutly loves loves to the point of divine worship This spotted and inconstant man
are you okay my love
Demetrius and Egeus go ahead I must ask you to do a few things about the wedding And meet with you about some issues that affect you
We follow you because we should and because we want to
What’s the matter my love
Why do you look so pale
Why do the roses in your cheeks fade so fast
Oh dear
I am too good to be in love with someone so low
Or else mismatched in terms of years  Oh spite
I am too old to be engaged to someone so young
to choose love by what another person sees
A good argument therefore listen to me Hermia
There gentle Hermia I may marry you And the sharp Athenian law cannot follow us To that place
If you love me then Sneaker away from your father's house tomorrow night And in the forest three miles outside town Where I met you once with Helena To celebrate a May Day morning party I will wait for you there
My good Lysander
I swear to you by Cupid's strongest bow By his best arrow the one with the golden head By the simplicity of Venus' doves By that which knits souls and favors lovers And by that fire which burned Dido the Carthage queen When the false Trojan Aeneas was seen sailing away  By all the vows that men have forever broken In greater numbers than women have ever spoken  In that same place you have described to me I will meet you tomorrow truly
Keep that promise love
Look here comes Helena
Hi fair Helena
Where are you going
If the world were mine and Demetrius mine I would give everything else to you to be changed anyway you want
Oh teach me your look and with what magic You have stolen Demetrius' heart
I frown at him but he still loves me
Oh I wish your frowns would teach my smiles to have that effect
I give him curses but he gives me love
Oh that my prayers could be answered with such affection
The more I hate him the more he follows me around
The more I love him the more he hates me
His silly behavior Helena is not my fault
Take it easy he shall see my face no more Lysander and I are going to leave this place quickly
Before I started seeing Lysander Athens seemed like a paradise to me
Oh so what graces then does he have That he has turned a heaven into hell
we must not give in To hugs and kisses until midnight tomorrow
I will my Hermia
How happy can some other “other” be
I am considered as fair as she is throughout Athens
But so what
Demetrius doesn’t think so He won’t know what everyone but him knows
Love can transpose things that are low and ugly Having no good qualities at all Into things that have beauty and dignity
Love doesn’t look with the eyes but with the mind And that’s why Cupid is painted with a blindfold
Because before Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyes He swore many oaths that he was only mine And when this torrent of oaths was rejected by Hermia Demetrius dissolved and his oaths melted too
I’ll tell him of fair Hermia's flight Then tomorrow night he will pursue her To the forest and even if he just thanks me For this knowledge it is sweet payment
But I mean to make my pain worth suffering To have him look at me there and back again
Is everybody here
It would be better if you took attendance man by man according to the list
Here is the list of every man's name who are thought to be the best in all Athens to play in our play before the duke and duchess at night on their wedding day
First good Peter Quince tell us what the play’s about then read the names of the actors and so get to the point
By Mary our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe
Ok guys spread out
I’m ready
Tell me what my part is and then proceed
You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus
What is Pyramus
a lover or a tyrant
A lover that kills himself most gallantly for love
That will require some tears in the true performance of it
I will move them to storms of tears I will rouse their pity in some measure
Francis Flute the bellows mender
Here Peter Quince
Flute you must take the role of Thisbe
What is Thisbe
A wandering knight
It is the lady that Pyramus loves
No please don’t let me play a woman I have a beard starting t o grow
That’s nothing to worry about You shall play it with a mask on and you can make your voice as light as you want
If I can hide my face let me play Thisbe too
Ok Go ahead
Robin Starveling the tailor
Here Peter Quince
Here Peter Quince
Have you written the lion's part
Please if it is give it to me now because I am slow in studying my lines
You may do it off the top of your head because it’s nothing but roaring
Let me play the lion too
I will roar so well that it will do any man's heart good to hear me I will roar so well that I will make the duke say “Let him roar again let him roar again” If you should do it too terribly you would so frighten the duchess and the ladies that they would scream and that would be enough to hang us all
That would hang us every mother's son
You can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a sweet faced man a proper man that you shall see on a summer's day a most lovely gentleman like man therefore you must absolutely play Pyramus
OK I’ll do it
What beard would be best to play it in
Whichever one you want
I will play it in either your straw color beard your orange tawny beard your purple in grain beard or your French crown color beard your perfect yellow
Some of your French crowns have no hair at all and then you will play it with no beard
In the meantime I will draw a list of props that our play needs
I beg you don’t let me down
We will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously
Be careful be perfect goodbye
We’ll meet at the duke's oak
Enough stay or get going
Hey spirit
Where are you going
Over hill over dale Through bush through brier Over park over pale Through flood through fire I am going everywhere Quicker than the moon goes through the sky And I serve the fairy queen To put dewdrops into her eyes upon the green
Farewell you group of spirits I have to get going
Our queen and all her elves are coming here any minute
Oberon is really angry and annoyed Because she just like her attendant has A lovely boy that was stolen from an Indian king She has never had so sweet a baby that was stolen
And now Titania and Oberon can never meet in the grove or on green By a clear fountain or spangled shiny starlight But they refuse to settle the issue so that all their elves Creep into acorn cups and hide them there because they’re so frightened
aren’t you the guy That scares the maidens of the village Skims cream from milk and sometimes works the churn And bootless makes the breathless housewife churn even harder And sometimes makes the drink so that it doesn’t have a yeasty foam Misleads wanderers who are out at night laughing at their getting lost
Those that call you Hobgoblin and sweet Puck You do their work and they shall have good luck
I am that merry wanderer of the night
I am jester to Oberon and make him smile as When I trick a fat horse that’s been eating beans into Neighing like a newborn female And sometimes I hide near to the town gossip's beer mug Looking like a roasted crab And when the gossip drinks I bob up against her lips And pour the ale on the withered skin of her neck skin all the way down
How unfortunate to meet you by moonlight proud Titania
Well well jealous Oberon
Fairies let’s go I have sworn not to go to his bed or to keep his company
am not I your lord
Then I must be your lady but I also know that When you have stolen away from fairy land And taking the shape of Corin the shepherd You have sat all day playing on pipes of corn And speaking love poems to amorous Phillida
How can you say these things for shame Titania Give me a little more credit than that with Hippolyta Knowing I know all about your love for Theseus
Didn’t you lead him through the glimmering night From Perigenia the girl he had just raped
And make him break his promise with fair Aegle Not to mention with Ariadne and Antiopa
These fogs which falling in the land Have made every rough river so high That they have flooded the continents where they flow
The human mortals want their winter here Blessed hymns and carols are sung every night  The moon that controls the flow of the floods Pale in her anger washes all the air But there are still many bad diseases
ice cold frosts Freeze the fresh crimson roses And on the old God of Harmony’s chin and icy crown Is set a circle of sweet summer buds Almost in mockery of the frost
The spring the summer The pregnant autumn and angry winter change Their usual clothes and the amazed world Now doesn’t know which is which by their apparel
Then fix it
Why should Titania cross her Oberon
But she because she was mortal died giving birth to the boy And for her sake I am raising him And for her sake I will not part with him
How long do you intend to stay within this forest
Maybe until after Theseus' wedding day
If you will patiently join our dances And see our moonlight parties go with us If not leave me alone and I won’t comment on where you’re going
Give me that boy and I will go with you
Not for your entire fairy kingdom
Fairies let’s go
This will only lead to another argument if I stay longer
My gentle Puck come here
You remember That time I sat on a big rock by the ocean And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back Singing such a sweet and melodious song That the rough sea became calm when it heard it And certain stars shot madly out of their orbits To hear the sea maid's music
I remember
But I watched and noted where Cupid’s arrow fell
Putting the juice of it on sleeping eyelids Will make or man or woman madly fall in love With the next live creature that it sees
Fetch me this herb and come right back Before a huge sea creature can swim three miles
I'll make my trip around the world In forty minutes
And before I remove this charm from her sight   Because I have another herb that is the antidote   I'll make her give that boy to me
But who’s coming here
I’ll make myself invisible And I eavesdrop on their conversation
I don’t love you so stop following me
Where are Lysander and fair Hermia
I’ll kill him and she kills me
You told me they snuck into this forest And I’m here and wander within this forest Because I cannot meet Hermia
Listen get going and once and for all stop following me
Even if you didn’t have the power to pull me I would still be powerless not to follow you
Do I encourage you
Do I talk to you sweetly
Or rather do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not and cannot love you
And even for that I love you all the more
I am your spaniel and Demetrius The more you beat me the more I will wag my tail for you
What worse place can I beg in your love And still keep my self respect   Than to be used as you would use your dog
Don’t try my patience and push me too hard Because the sight of you makes me sick
And I am sick when I don’t look at you
You are really putting your virginity at risk To leave the city and surrender yourself To the hands of someone who doesn’t love you To go night thinking that nothing can happen And to come to a deserted place With something as rich as your virginity
I trust your virtue as a man
It isn’t night whenever I see your face So I don’t think it’s night And this forest doesn’t lack worlds of company For you in my respect are all the world
Then how can it be said I am alone When the entire world is here to look at me
I'll run from you and hide in the bushes And leave you to the mercy of wild beasts
Apollo flies and Daphne chases him The dove pursues the vulture the mild deer Runs faster to catch the tiger   helpless speed When cowardice chases and courage flies
Ay in the temple in the town the field You do something to me
Shame on you Demetrius
I'll follow you and make a heaven of hell To die by the hand that I love so well
Welcome wanderer
Yes there it is
Please give it to me
You’ll be able to identify the man By the Athenian garments he has on
Please do this carefully that he will be more in love with her than she is with him
And meet me before the first rooster crows at dawn
You have nothing to be afraid of my lord I’ll do it
Come now a dance and a fairy song Then for the third part of a minute leave here Some to kill bugs in the musk rose buds Some to kill red mice for their leather wings To make my small elves coats and some to quiet The noisy owl that nightly hoots and wonders About us
Sing me now to sleep Then go to your tasks and let me rest
You spotted snakes with double tongue Thorny hedgehogs be not seen Newts and blindworms do no wrong Come not near our fairy queen
Philomel with melody Sing in our sweet lullaby
Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
Let’s go now all is well
One of you stand sentinel over there
Wake when some vile thing is near
Fair love you are exhausted with wandering in the forest
You find yourself a bed And I will rest my head upon this bank
One bit of land will be a pillow for us both One heart one bed two bosoms and one trust
Oh sweetheart take what I said in an innocent sense
Love takes the meaning in love's conversation
Then don’t tell me not to sleep by your side Because in sleeping near you Hermia I do not lie
Lysander riddles very prettily
Now curse my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied
May your love never change until your sweet life ends
Amen amen I say to that fair prayer And then my life end when I end loyalty
I’ve gone through the whole forest But I haven’t found any Athenian On whose eyes I might pour This flower's juice to stir his love
Pretty soul
she doesn’t dare lie Near this lack love this kill courtesy
So awake when I am gone For I must go now to Oberon
Stay though you kill me sweet Demetrius
I order you get far away from me and do not haunt me thus
Oh will you a dark natured man leave me
Don’t
Stay here at your own risk I will go on alone
Oh I am out of breath in this happy chase
The more I pray the less grace I have
Hermia is happy wherever she lies Because she has blessed and attractive eyes
How did her eyes come to be so bright
What wicked and lying mirror of mine Made me compare my eyes with Hermia's
But who’s here Lysander
on the ground
I see no blood no wound
Lysander if you live good sir wake up
And I will run through fire I will for your sweet sake
Transparent Helena
Nature has made it so that I can see through your chest all the way to your heart
Where is Demetrius
Oh how fitting it is that That vile name should perish on my sword
Don’t say that Lysander don’t say that
So what if he loves your Hermia
Lord so what
Content with Hermia
The will of man is persuaded by his reason And reason says you are the worthier maid
Things that grow are not ripe until it’s their season to be ripe So I being young have not been ripened in reason And touching the point of human skill now Reason has become the commander of my will And it leads me to your eyes where I see Love's stories written in love's richest book
Why was I born to this keen mockery
When did I earn this scorn at your hands
Isn’t it enough isn’t it enough young man That I never did no nor never can Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye But you must joke about what I’m lacking
Good lord you do me wrong  good lord you do  To court me In such disdainful manner
Oh that a lady of one man refused Should therefore be abused by another
Lysander look how I shake with fear
what gone
Lysander
lord
What can’t hear me
Gone
No sound no word
O my where are you
Speak if you hear me Speak of all loves
I almost faint with fear
No then I can see that you’re not near
I'll find either death or you immediately
Are we all here
Ready ready and here's a marvelously convenient place for our rehearsal
This green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn bush our dressing room and we will do it just as we will do it before the duke
Peter Quince  What do you say bully Bottom
There are things in this comedy of “Pyramus and Thisbe” that will never please an audience
First Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannot stand
What do you think about that
Damn a risky business
I believe we must leave the killing out when all is said and done
This will keep them from being frightened
No make it two lines more
Won’t the ladies be afraid of the lion
I’m afraid so I promise you
Well then another prologue must say that he is not really a lion
You must tell his name and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck and he himself must speak through the mask saying this or something to the same defect "Ladies" or "Fair ladies I would wish you or I would request you or I would entreat you not to be afraid not to tremble
my life for yours
If you think I come here as a lion shame on me
Well OK
But there are two more hard things that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber because as you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight
Does the moon shine that night we play our play
A calendar a calendar
Yes it does shine that night
Why then may you leave a panel of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at that panel
Ay or else someone must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern and say he comes to imitate or to present the person of moonshine
Some man or other must look like a wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough cast cement around him to signify the wall and let him hold his fingers open like this and through that cranny Pyramus and Thisbe will whisper
If that can be done then I think we’ve covered everything
Come sit down every mother's son and rehearse your parts
What woven country folk do we have swaggering here So near the cradle of the fairy queen
What a play
I'll listen be An actor too perhaps if I see a place to jump in
Must I speak now
Ay darn it you must because you must understand he only Goes to see a noise that he heard and will come again
You speak your whole part all at once cues and all Pyramus enter
Oh strange
We are attacked by ghosts
Let’s go guys
Help
I'll follow you I'll lead you in a circle Through bog through bush through more bushes through brier Sometimes I’ll be a horse sometimes a hound dog A hog a headless bear sometimes a fire And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn
Why do they run away
This is a bad joke of theirs to frighten me
Oh Bottom you are changed
What do I see on you
What do you see
You see an donkey head of your own do you
This is to make a donkey of me to frighten me if they can
The black rooster so black of hue With orange tawny bill The thrush with his note so true The wren with little quill
What angel wakes me from my flowery bed
So my eye is very attracted to your shape And your fair virtue's force violently moves me On the first look of you to say to swear I love you
The more’s the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends
No I can only make a joke for a specific occasion
You are as wise as you are beautiful
I am a spirit of no simple power  The summer still waits for me And I love you
Moth
and Mustardseed
Ready
And I
And I
And I
Where shall we go
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman Jump into his steps as he walks and dance in his eyes Feed him apricots and dewberries Purple grapes green figs and mulberries Steal the honey bags from the bumblebees And for night lights cut their waxen thighs And light them at the fiery glow worm's eyes In order to have my love go to sleep and wake up And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams out of sleeping eyes
Greet him elves and do him courtesies
Hail mortal
Hail
Hail
Hail
I beg your honors’ mercy heartily What is your name
Cobweb
I would like to get to know you better good Master Cobweb
Peasblossom
Mustardseed
Good Master Mustardseed I know you well
That same cowardly giant like roast beef has devoured many people from your family
I promise you your relatives have made my eyes water before now
I want to get to know you as well good Master Mustardseed
Come on wait on him lead him to my private apartment
The moon I think looks as if she has watery eyes And when she weeps every little flower weeps Lamenting some enforced chastity
Cover his mouth bring him silently
I wonder if Titania is up yet And what it was that next came into her sight Which she must love in the extreme
What’s going on now about this haunted grove
My mistress is in love with a monster
Near to her close and consecrated private place While she was sleeping A crew of actors rude mechanicals That work for bread near Athenian shops Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus' wedding day
The stupidest man of these dim country folk Who acted Pyramus in their rehearsal Exited from his scene and entered in a bunch of bushes When I took advantage of him And I fixed donkey's head on his head
Then his Thisbe must be answered And my creation comes back to the rehearsal
Their senses thus weakened lost within their strong fears Made senseless things begin to do them wrong Because briers and thorns catch their clothes Some sleeves some hats
This works out better than I could have planned
But have you touched the Athenian's eyes With the love juice yet as I told you to
I did it while he was sleeping that is finished too  And the Athenian woman by his side So that when he woke up she must of course be the first he saw
Stand close this is the same Athenian
This is the woman but not this the man
Oh why do you reject him that loves you so
Say these bitter things to your bitter foe
Now I only scold but I should give you worse Because you I fear has given me cause to curse
If you have slain Lysander in his sleep Being in blood over your shoes plunge the knife Deep into me and kill me too
The sun was not as true to the daytime As he was to me
Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia
I'd believe as quickly that This whole earth may be bored and that the moon May creep through the centre and so disrupt Her brother's noontide with the other side of the world
It can only mean that you have murdered him A murderer should look like you so dead so grim
What's this got to do with my Lysander
Where is he
Ah good Demetrius will you give him to me
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds
Get out dog
Get out low life
You drive me past the bounds Of a maiden's patience
Have you slain him then
Oh
For once tell the truth tell the truth even for my sake
Did you dare to look at him being awake And have you killed him sleeping
Oh brave touch
Couldn’t a worm a poisonous snake do as much
I am not guilty of killing Lysander And he isn’t dead as far as I can tell
I beg you tell me then that he is well
And if I could what should I get for saying so
You will see me no more whether he be dead or not
So sorrow's heaviness does heavier grow Because my sleep has been interrupted
What have you done
You have made a major mistake And laid the love juice on some true love's sight
Some true love turned false must follow because of your mistake And not a false love turned true
Then fate overrules me that as one man keeping his promise A million fail in keeping theirs confusing oath on oath
I go I go look how I go  Swifter than an arrow from the barbarian’s bow
Flower with this purple dye Hit by Cupid's arrow Sink into the apple of his eye
Captain of our fairy band Helena is here at hand And the youth mistaken by me Pleading for her love Shall we watch what they’re doing
O beware my lord of jealousy Lord what fools these mortals be
Stand aside
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake
Why should you think that I should not court you seriously
You cannot find scorn and derision in tears of love
Look when I vow I weep and vows that are born in tears Show the whole truth at that moment
How can these things in me seem like ridicule to you When my tears prove them to be true
You move your cunning ahead more and more
When truth kills truth oh devilish holy fight
These vows are Hermia's
Will you give her up
I had no sense of judgment when I swore love to her
Nor none in my mind now you give her up
Demetrius loves her and he doesn’t love you
What my love shall I compare your eyes to
Crystal is muddy
Oh how ripe your lips are Those kissing cherries grow tempting
When you hold up your hand that pure congealed white top High Taurus' snow fanned with the eastern wind Turns to a crow
Oh let me kiss This princess hand of pure white this seal of bliss
Oh spite
Oh hell
I see you all are bent To set against me for your entertainment
If you were civil and had any manners You wouldn’t insult me so much like this
Can’t you just hate me as I know you do Instead of joining together to mock me too
If you were men as you are men on the outside You wouldn’t use a gentle lady like this To vow and swear and super praise my parts When I am sure you hate me with your hearts
You both are rivals and love Hermia And now both rivals to mock Helena
A really good exploit a manly enterprise To bring up tears in a poor maid's eyes With your insults
None of the noble sort Would so offend a virgin and try A poor soul's patience all to make you laugh
You are unkind Demetrius don’t be like that Because you love Hermia
Never did mockers waste more idle breath
Lysander keep your Hermia I will have none of her
If I ever loved her all that love is gone
My heart journeyed to her only like a guest And now has returned home to Helena There to remain
Helena it’s not true
But why did you leave me so unkindly
Why should he stay whom love presses to go
What love could press Lysander from my side
Lysander's love that would not let him wait  Fair Helena who makes the night more golden Than all the fiery rays and eyes of light
Why are you looking for me
Couldn’t this make you know That the hate I have for you made me leave you like that
You don’t speak as you think it cannot be
Wow she is one of this conspiracy
Now I see that all three have gotten together To design this false joke in spite of me
Insulting Hermia
Most ungrateful maid
Have you conspired have you contrived with these men To bait me with this disgusting insult
Is all the conversation that we two have shared The sisters' vows the hours that we have spent When we have scolded the clock For parting us Oh is it all forgotten
All school days' friendship childhood innocence
We Hermia like two artificial gods Have created both one flower with our needles Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion Both warbling of one song both in one key As if our hands our sides voices and minds Had been incorporated into one
And will you tear our ancient love apart To join with men in scorning your poor friend
Have you not set Lysander as in scorn To follow me and praise my eyes and face
And made your other love Demetrius  Who even just a minute ago spurned me with his foot  To call me goddess nymph divine and rare Precious celestial
Why does he speak this To me whom he hates
and why does Lysander Deny your love so rich within his soul And give me indeed affection Except by your putting them up to it by your consent
Although I may not be as graceful as you So hung upon with love so fortunate But most miserable most to love and still be unloved
You should pity rather than despise this situation
I don’t understand what you mean by this
If you have any pity grace or manners You would not make me such an argument
Stay gentle Helena hear my reason My love my life my soul fair Helena
Oh excellent
Sweet don’t scorn her like that
If she cannot beg I can order
You can order no more than she can beg Your threats have no more strength than her weak prayers  Helena I love you by my life I do I swear by that which I will lose for you To prove him a liar that says I don’t love you
I say I love you more than he does
If you say so go away and prove it too
Away you black giant
You are a tame man go
Why have you become so rude
What change is this Sweet love
Your love
Get out tawny barbarian out
Out loathed medicine
Hated potion get away
You aren’t joking
Yes truly and so do you
Demetrius I will keep my word with you
I wish I had your guarantee because I see that A weak bond holds you I'll not trust your word
Although I hate her I'll not harm her like that
What
can you do me greater harm than hate
Hate me
why
Oh me
what news my love
Aren’t I Hermia
Aren’t you Lysander
Why then you left me Oh the gods forbid  Seriously shall I say
Therefore be out of hope of question doubt Be certain nothing truer it’s no joke That I do hate you and love Helena
Oh me
You juggler
you rotten scoundrel
You thief of love
What
have you come by night And stolen my love's heart from him
Fine OK
Don’t you have any modesty any maiden shame Any touch of bashfulness
What
will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue
shame on you shame on you
You counterfeit you puppet you
OK so that’s the way the game goes
How low am I you painted maypole
I am not yet so low That my nails can’t reach yours eyes
I beg you although you mock me gentlemen Don’t let her hurt me
I was never cursed I have no gift at all in being a fighter I am a right maid for my cowardice Don’t let her strike me
You may think perhaps Because she is something lower than myself That I can match her movements
Good Hermia don’t be so angry with me
I always loved you Hermia Always kept your counsels never wronged you Except that because of my love for Demetrius I told him of your running away into this forest
Let me go
You see how simple and how in love I am
Why get going
Who’s stopping you
A foolish heart that I’m leaving behind here
What
with Lysander
With Demetrius
Don’t be afraid she shall not harm you Helena
No sir she shall not although you take her side
Little again
Let me get her
Get going you dwarf You zero made of scraps of grass You bead you acorn
You are too over zealous On her behalf that rejects your services
Follow
No I'll go with you cheek by jowl
You mistress all this trouble is because of you
No don’t go back
I will not trust you I won’t And I’ll stay in your cursed company no longer
Your hands are quicker than mine for a fight My legs are longer though to run away
I am amazed and don’t know what to say
This is your negligence
Either you are really mistaken Or you commit these errors willfully
Believe me king of shadows I was really mistaken
Didn’t you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he had on
And so far I am glad it worked out this way Because I am really enjoying the show
Do you see that these lovers are looking for a place to fight
Get going then Robin make the night darker Cover the stars in the sky With drooping fog as black as Acheron And lead these testy rivals so astray That they will not come within another's way
Sometimes imitate Lysander’s voice To stir up Demetrius’ anger And sometimes sound like Demetrius And that way you can lead them from each other Until sleep imitating death creeps over their eyebrows With leaden legs and batty wings
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye Its juice has the virtuous property Of removing all error from his eyes And will make his eyeballs roll with correct sight
When they next wake up all this conflict Shall seem to be a dream and a worthless vision And back to Athens the lovers shall go With happiness and agreement that will never end
While I use you to solve this affair I'll go to my queen and beg the Indian boy from her And then I will release her charmed eye So that she will see the monster and all things shall be at peace
My fairy lord this must be done very quickly Because night is quickly coming to an end And over there is the first hint of morning sunlight Which when it is seen by ghosts wandering here and there They all troop home to the graveyards
Up and down up and down I will lead them up and down
The field and town are afraid of me
Goblin lead them up and down
Here comes one
Where are you proud Demetrius
Speak now
Here villain drawn and ready
Where are you
I’ll be right with you
Follow me then To a clear place
You runaway you coward have you run away
Speak
Are you hiding in some bush
Where are you
You coward are you bragging to the stars Telling the bushes that you look for wars But will not fight one
Come on lazy loafer come on you child I'll whip you with a rod
If someone else kills you He will be cursed
Hey are you there
Follow my voice we won’t test your manhood here
He went before me and still dares me to fight When I get to where he’s calling from he’s gone
Welcome gentle day
Because even if you only shine your grey light one time I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite
Ho ho ho ho
Coward why don’t you come
Wait for me if you dare Because I know well That you are running before me moving from place to place Not daring to stand still or look me in the face
Where are you
Come over here I am here
No then you are making fun of me
Oh weary night Oh long and tedious night Cut your hours short
Only three
Come on one more Two boys and two girls makes up four
I have never been so weary never so sad Wet from the dew and torn with briers I can’t crawl any further
Here I’ll rest until daybreak
Heavens shield Lysander if they really mean to fight
Come sit down on this flowery bed While I play with your amiable cheeks And stick musk roses in your sleek smooth head And kiss your fair large ears my gentle joy
Where's Peasblossom
Ready
Ready
Mr Cobweb good monsieur get all your weapons in your hand and kill me a red hipped humble bee on the top of a thistle and good monsieur bring me his honey bag
Ready
Give me your hand Mr Mustardseed
I beg you stop making curtsies good sir
What can I do for you
Nothing good sir but for you to help Mr Cobweb scratch my head
I have to get to the barber's sir because I think I have an awful lot of hair on my face and I am such a sensitive donkey that I must scratch even if my hair only tickles me a little
Will you hear some music my sweet love
I have a reasonable good musical ear let’s sing and dance
Or say sweet love what you desire to eat
Truly a peck of dry food I could munch your good dry oats
I think I have a great desire to a bottle of hay
Good hay sweet hay has no equal
I have an adventurous fairy that shall seek What the squirrel has been hoarding and get you new nuts
I’d rather have a handful or two of dried peas
But I beg you don’t let any of your people wake me up I feel a deep sleep coming
You sleep and I will hold you in my arms
Fairies be gone and stay away
I will put my arms around you just as the woodbine twists around the sweet honeysuckle  like the female ivy Winds around the branches of the elm
Oh how I love you
how I adore on you
Welcome good Robin
Do you see this sweet sight
She had put a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers All around his hairy face And that same dew which sometimes was accustomed To swell like round and orient pearls on the buds Was now within the pretty flowers' eyes Like tears that were crying about their own sins
When at my pleasure I had teased her And she calmly begged my patience I asked her for the Indian child Which she gave me Right away and sent her fairy To carry him to my private place in fairy land
And now that I have the boy I will undo This hateful spell that I have put on her eyes
And gentle Puck take this donkey head Off the head of this Athenian lover That when he wakes when the others do All of them may go back to Athens Thinking no more about tonight’s events than That they were parts of a dream
But first I will release the fairy queen
Be as you are accustomed to being See as you are accustomed to seeing
The bud from the Moon goddess’ plant Has such force and blessed power over Cupid's flower
Now my Titania wake up my sweet queen
My Oberon
What visions have I seen
I thought I was in love with a donkey
Your “love” is lying there
How did all this happen
Quiet for awhile Robin take off this head
Titania call for music and strike the senses of all these five so that they seem more dead than sleeping
Now when you awake see with yours own fool's eyes
Sound music
Come my queen hold hands with me And rock the ground where these sleepers are
Now you and I have a new friendship And will solemnly dance In Duke Theseus' house triumphantly Tomorrow at midnight And bless it for all fair prosperity
There the pairs of faithful lovers shall be Married with Theseus all in jollity
Fairy king see and listen I do hear the morning lark
Then my queen in sad silence We dance after night's darkness
We go around the globe Swifter than the wandering moon
Come my lord and as we fly Tell me how it happened this night That I was found here sleeping On the ground with these mortals
I never heard Such gallant scolding because besides the groves The skies the fountains every region near Seemed to have one mutual cry
I never heard So musical a noise such sweet thunder
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind So jawed so sandy colored and their heads are hung With ears that sweep along the ground Crook kneed and dew covered like Thessaly bulls Slow in pursuit but matched in their barks like bells Each one under the other
A cry more tuneable Was never called to or cheered with a horn In Crete in Sparta or in Thessaly
My lord this is my daughter here asleep And this Lysander this Demetrius is This Helena old Nedar's Helena
I wonder why they are here together
It is my lord
Go bid the huntsmen wake them up by blowing the horns
Good morning friends
Saint Valentine’s Day is past Do these forest birds begin only now to make a couple
Pardon my lord
I beg you all stand up
I know you two are rival enemies How does this gentle concord in the world come about That hatred is so far from jealousy That you can sleep without fear
Our intention Was to be gone from Athens and to get to a place Where we might be together without the Punishment of the Athenian law
My lord fair Helena told me of their running away And why they ran here to this forest And in fury I followed them here Fair Helena in love following me
I was engaged to her my lord Before I saw Hermia
But like a sickness I hated the taste this food But now healthy my natural tastes restored Now I wish it love it long for it And will for evermore be true to it
Fair lovers it’s good that we found you here
We will hear more of this story later  Egeus I will override your demands These couples shall eternally be knit By and by with us in the temple
These things seem small and murky Like far off mountain tops turned into clouds
I think I see these things with unfocused eyes As when every thing seems double
Yes and my father
And Hippolyta
And he did bid us to follow him to the temple didn’t he
When my cue comes call me and I will answer
My next is 'Most fair Pyramus
Heigh ho Peter Quince
Flute the bellows mender
Snout the tinker
Starveling
Oh my God they have run away and left me asleep
I have had a most rare vision
I have had a dream  it’s beyond the smartest man to say what kind of dream it was Man is only a donkey if he goes about to telling this dream
I thought I was there is no man can tell what
I thought I was and I thought I had but a man is only a mended fool if he will offer to say what I thought I had
The eye of man has not heard the ear of man has not seen man's hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive or his heart to report what my dream was
I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream
It shall be called Bottom's Dream because it has no bottom and I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the duke
Perhaps to make it the more gracious I shall sing it at her death
Have you sent someone to Bottom's house
Has he come home yet
No one has heard anything about him
No doubt he’s kidnapped
If he doesn’t come then the play is incomplete it doesn’t go on does it
It’s not possible
There’s not a man in all Athens able to play Pyramus but he
No he has simply the best wit of any working man in Athens
You must say “paragon” A “paramour” is God bless us a thing of nothing
Sirs the duke is coming from the temple and there are two or three lords and ladies more married
If our play had gone forward we would’ve all been made men
Oh sweet bully Bottom
Six cents a day in Pyramus or nothing
Where are these lads
Where are these hearts
Bottom Oh most courageous day
Oh most happy hour
I will tell you everything just as it happened
Let’s hear it sweet Bottom
Not a word from me
All that I will tell you is that the duke has dined
Get your costumes together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your shoes meet presently at the palace every man look over his part for the short and the long of it is they want to see our play
In any case let Thisbe have clean linen and don’t let him that plays the lion cut his nails because they shall hang out for the lion's claws
And most dear actors don’t eat any onions nor garlic because we are to utter our lines with sweet breath And I don’t doubt that we will hear them say it is a sweet comedy
No more words
It’s strange my Theseus the story that these lovers speak of
More strange than true
I never may believe These antique fables or these fairy toys
Lovers and madmen have such busy brains Such ability to shape fantasies that they catch More than cool reason ever understands
The lunatic the lover and the poet Are all compact in their imagination
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold That is the madman
The lover just as crazy Sees Helen of Troy's beauty in an Egyptian
The poet's eye rolling in a fine frenzy Glances from heaven to earth from earth to heaven And as imagination sends out The forms of things unknown the poet's pen Turns them to shapes and gives a local place and a name To airy nothing
Such tricks have strong imagination That if it would only catch some joy It understands some bringer of that joy Or in the night imagining some fear How easy is a bush thought to be a bear
But the whole story of the night told over And all their minds changed all at the same time Shows more witnesses than just images of the mind And grows to something of great lasting But nevertheless strange and admirable
Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth  Joy gentle friends
Joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts
More than you wish for us Waits in your royal walks your board your bed
Come now what plays what dances shall we have To pass the three hours Between our after supper and bed time
Where is our usual manager of mirth
What revels are in store
Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour
Call Philostrate
Say what entertainment do you have for this evening
What play
what music
How shall we spend The lazy time if not with some delight
There is a brief list of how many events there are Make choice of which your highness will see first
tedious and brief
That’s like hot ice and wondrous strange snow
How shall we find the concord of this discord
A play there is my lord some ten words long Which is as brief as I have known a play But by ten words my lord it is too long Which makes it tedious because in all the play There is not one appropriate word one player a good actor
Who are they that do play it
Hard working men that work here in Athens Who never worked in their minds until now And now they have toiled their bad memories To do this play in honor of your wedding
And we’ll hear it
No my noble lord It is not for you
I’ve heard And it is nothing nothing in the world Unless you can laugh at their intentions Extremely stretched and done with cruel pain To do you service
I will hear that play Because nothing can ever be wrong When simpleness and duty give it freely
I don’t like to see misery over played And duty dying in his service
Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
He says they can’t do anything like this
That makes us kinder to give them thanks for nothing
And what poor duty can’t do Noble respect takes it in force not merit
In places I go to great clerks have purposed To greet me with prepared welcomes I have seen them shiver and look pale Make full stops in the middle of sentences Mess up their practiced speeches in their fears And in conclusion stop all together dumbstruck Not paying me a welcome
Trust me sweet Out of this silence I still picked out a welcome And in the modesty of fearful duty I can understand as much as if it were from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence
Love therefore and tongue tied simplicity Speaking the least means most to me
So please your grace the prologue is next
Let him approach
If we offend you it is with our good will
But you should think that we don’t come to offend But with good will
To show our simple skill That is the true beginning of our end
Consider then that we come but in scorn
We don’t come as we mean to content you Is our true intent
All for your delight We are not here
He has ridden his prologue like a rough colt
Indeed he has played on this prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in order
His speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered
Who’s next
Gentles perhaps you wonder at this show But wonder on until the truth makes all things clear
This man is Pyramus if you want to know This beauteous lady is certainly Thisbe
This man with lantern dog and thorn bush Represents Moonshine because if you want to know These lovers think it’s no shame to meet at Ninus' tomb By moonshine there there to court each other
This grisly beast which known by name Lion Scared away or rather frightened the trusty Thisbe Coming first to the place by night And as she fled she dropped her shawl Which vile Lion stained with his bloody mouth
For all the rest Let Lion Moonshine Wall and the two lovers Tell you while they stay here
I wonder if the lion is going to speak
Do you need lime and hair to speak better
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard speak my lord
Pyramus draws near the wall silence
Oh grim looked night
Oh night with hue so black
Oh night which ever is when day is not
Thanks courteous wall
Jove protect you well for this
But what see what see I
I don’t see Thisbe
Oh wicked wall through whom I see no bliss Cursed be your stones for deceiving me like this
The wall I think being sensible should curse again
No in truth sir he should not
Deceiving me” is Thisbe's cue
She is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall
You shall see it will fall right just as I told you she comes From over there
Oh wall you have heard my moans very often For separating my fair Pyramus and me
I see a voice now I’ll go to the chink To spy if I can hear my Thisbe's face
Thisbe
My love
you are my love I think
Think what you will I am your lover's grace And like Limander I am still trusty
And I’m like Helena until the fates kill me
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true
As Shafalus to Procrus I am to you
Oh kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
I kiss the wall's hole not your lips at all
Will you meet me straightway at Ninny's tomb
Fighting life fighting death I come without delay
So I wall have discharged my part And being done Wall goes away like this
Now is the wall down between the two neighbors
No remedy my lord when walls are so willful to hear without warning
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard
The best plays are only shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination can fill in the gaps
It must be your imagination then and not theirs
If we imagine no worse of them than they imagine of themselves they may pass for excellent men
Here come two noble beasts a moon and a lion
You ladies you whose gentle hearts fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor May now perhaps both quake and tremble here When a rough lion roars in wildest rage
A very gentle beast and of a good conscience
The very best at a beast my lord that ever I saw
This lion is a very fox for his courage
True and a goose for his secret keeping
Not so my lord because his courage cannot carry his secret keeping but the fox carries the goose
His secret keeping I am sure cannot carry his courage because the goose cannot carry the fox
He is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circle
This lantern represents the horned moon I myself seem to be the man in the moon
How else is it the man in the moon
He doesn’t dare come there for the candle because you see it’s already out
I am weary of this moon
I wish he would change
It appears by his small light of discretion that he is growing dark but still politely in all reason we must pass the time
Proceed moon
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lantern is the moon I the man in the moon this thorn bush my thorn bush and this dog my dog
Why all these should be in the lantern for all these are in the moon
But silence here comes Thisbe
This is old Ninny's tomb
Where is my love
Well run Thisbe
Well moused lion
And here comes Pyramus
And then the lion vanishes
But stay Oh spite
But mark poor knight What dreadful sorrow is here
Eyes do you see
How can it be
Oh dainty duck
Oh dear
Your shawl good What
stained with blood
Approach you vicious fates
Oh fates
come come Cut thread and thrum Quail rush conclude and quell
This passion and the death of a dear friend would go far In making a man look sad
Curse my heart but I pity the man
Oh why nature did you make lions
Since the vile lion vile has here taken my dear Which is no no which was the fairest dame That lived that loved that liked that looked with cheer
Come tears confound Out sword and wound The pap (heart) of Pyramus
Ay that left pap Where the heart beats  Thus die I thus thus thus
Now am I dead Now am I fled My soul is in the sky
Now die die die die die
No die but an ace for him because he is only one
Less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove a donkey
How is it that moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover
A particle of dust will turn the balance which Pyramus which Thisbe is the better
She has already seen him with those sweet eyes
And thus she moans that is to say  Asleep my love
What dead my dove
Oh Pyramus arise Speak speak
Quite dumb
Dead dead
A tomb Must cover your sweet eyes
Oh Sisters Three Come come to me With hands as pale as milk Lay them in gore Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk
Moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead
Ay and wall too
No I assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers
Will it please you to see the epilogue or to hear an Italian country dance between two of our company
No epilogue I beg you because your play needs no excuse
Never excuse for when the players are all dead there’s no one to be blamed
God if he who wrote the play had played Pyramus and hanged himself in Thisbe's garter it would have been a fine tragedy
And so it is truly and very notably acted
But come your Italian country dance forget your epilogue
I’m afraid we shall oversleep in the morning As much as we stayed up late this night
As you go through the house use the dead and drowsy fire to give glimmering light Every elf and fairy spirit Hop as lightly as bird hops from a thorn And sing this little song following me And dance it as you sing it
Now until dawn Each fairy wander through this house
We will go to the best marriage bed Which shall be blessed by us And the children created there Shall forever be lucky and prosperous
Dance away Don’t delay All of you meet me by dawn
If we actors have offended you Think about this  and everything will be all right  you have only dozed off here While these visions appeared
And this weak and idle play about love Doesn’t mean any more than a dream
So good night to you all
Let’s have your applause if we are friends And Robin shall make good on his promise
Rubbish
Don’t tell me I don’t like it at all That you Iago who has used my purse As if the strings were yours should know about this
but you’re not listening to me
If I ever dreamt about such a matter Hate me
You told me you hated him
Despise me if I don’t
Truly a great arithmetician One Michael Cassio a Florentine A fellow almost damned in a having a beautiful wife That has never led a squadron in the field And doesn’t know the division of a battle any More than a spinster does unless the theory books In which the consuls wearing togas can propose a plan As masterly as he can
By heaven I would rather have been his hangman
Why there's no remedy it is the curse of the military
Preference goes by who you know and who likes you And not by old system where each second person Took the first’s place
Now sir judge it for yourself Whether or I am better suited in any beautiful terms To love the Moor
I wouldn’t follow him then
You shall see Many a duteous and knee bending rogue That doting on his own obedient slavery Wears himself out much like his master's ass For nothing but dry oats and when he's old dismissed From the service
I would whip such honest rogues
There are others who dressed in uniforms and faces of duty that keep their hearts attending on themselves And throwing only shows of service to their lords Thrive well by them and when they have lined their coats Do themselves homage
These fellows have some soul And someone like that is how I am
Because sir It is as sure as you are Roderigo Were I the Moor I would not be Iago
What great luck the thick lips have If he can get away with this
even if his joy is joy Still throw such aggravation on it That he won’t stay happy for long
Go ahead yell with frightening accent and distress As when a fire Is seen in big cities at night and by accident
What ho Brabantio
Signior Brabantio ho
Awake
what ho Brabantio
Thieves
Thieves
Thieves
Look at your house your daughter and your bags
Thieves
Thieves
What is the reason for this terrible summons
What’s the matter there
Signior is your family all inside
Are your doors locked
Get up I say
What have you lost your wits
Very reverend Signior do you know my voice
No who are you
My name is Roderigo
The worst welcome
I have ordered you not to hang around my doors In honest plainness you have heard me say My daughter is not for you and now in madness Being full of supper and drunk You come out of maliciousness To interrupt my sleep
Sir sir sir But you must certainly be sure that My spirit and my place have power in them To make this bitter to you
Patience good sir
Why are you telling me about robbing
this is Venice My house is not a farm
Very grave Brabantio I come to you in simple and pure soul
Zounds sir you are one of those who wouldn’t serve God if the devil asked you to
Because we are servants and you think we are ruffians you'd have your daughter covered with a African horse you'd have your nephews neigh to you you'd have chargers for cousins and small Spanish horses for Germans
Who the hell are you
I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making a Satan
You are a villain
You are a senator
Sir I will answer anything
Give me a candle
Wake up all my servants
Farewell because I must leave you
It doesn’t seem right or suitable to my position To be a witness (which I will be if I stay) Against the Moor
because I know the government No matter how angry this makes Brabantio with some Argument cannot arrest him safely because he's Embarked with such loud reason to the Cyprus wars Which is being discussed even now that to save their Souls they have no one of his depth To lead their armies in which regard Although I hate him as I hate hell pains I must still show a flag and sign of love To preserve my present life Which is indeed only sign
So that you shall surely find him lead these searchers to the Sagittary Inn And I will be there with him
So farewell
How did you know it was she
Get more Candles Wake up all my relatives
Do you think they’re married
Truly I think they are
How did she get out
O treason of the blood
Fathers from now on don’t believe you can know your daughters' minds from the way you see them act
Haven’t you read Roderigo Of some such thing
Yes sir I have indeed
Call my brother
Do you know Where we may catch her and the Moor
I think I can find him if you’d please Get a good guard and go along with me
I beg you lead on
Although I have slain men during a war I believe it is a grave matter of the conscience To do a premeditated murder
I don’t have evil in me Sometimes to do me service
Nine or ten times I had thought to have stabbed him here under the ribs
It is better as it is
No but he chattered on And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That with the little godliness I have I worked hard to tolerate him
But I beg you sir Are you really married
Be assured of this That the magnifico is very popular And has in his office a voice equal To twice the duke's
he will divorce you Or apply to you what restraint and grievance The law will allow him to do With all his might to do it
Let him do his worse
My services that I have done for the signiory Shall out shout his complaints
But look
what lights are coming
Those are the awakened father and his friends
You had better go in
Is it they
By Janus I don’t think so
The goodness of the night on you friends
What’s the news
The duke greets you general And he requires your super speedy appearance This instant
What’s the matter do you think
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequential messengers This very night at one another's heels And many of the consuls awakened and meeting Are at the duke's already
You have been hotly called for When you weren’t found at your lodging The senate sent about three different requests To search for you
It is good that you found me
I will only say one more word here in the house And I’ll go with you
Ensign what is he doing here
I don’t understand
He's married
To whom
By Mary to… Come captain will you go
Let’s go
Here comes another group to see for you
General be careful He comes with bad intentions
Stop
Stop there
Signior it is the Moor
You Roderigo
Come sir I will fight you
O you foul thief where have you hidden my daughter
Damned as you are you have cast a spell on her Because I'll restore myself to all things of sense If she wasn’t bound in chains of magic Would a maid so tender beautiful and happy So opposed to marriage that she shunned The wealthy curled darlings of our country Would she ever have to merit a public joke Run from her father to the black bosom Of a thing such as you to fear not to delight in
I therefore arrest and attack you As an abuser of the world a practitioner Of the forbidden and illegal arts
If he resists Subdue him at his peril
To prison until the right time Of law and course of justice Call you to answer
What if I obey
How may the duke be satisfied with that Whose messengers are here by my side On some urgent business of the state To bring me to him
It is true very worthy Signior The duke's in council and your noble self I am sure is sent for
What
The duke in council
The duke himself Or any of my brothers of the state Can only feel this wrong as if it were their own Because if such actions may have passage free Bond slaves and pagans shall be our statesmen
There is no written in this news That makes them believable
Indeed they are out of proportion My letters say a hundred and seven galleys
And mine a hundred and forty
And mine two hundred
What ho
what ho
what ho
A messenger from the galleys
Now what's the latest
The Turkish armies are headed for Rhodes So I was asked to report here to the state By Signior Angelo
What do you say about this change
No in all confidence the Turks are not going to Rhodes
Here is more news
The Ottoman reverend and gracious Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes Have joined a later fleet there with them
Yes so I thought
How many do you guess
Signior Montano Your trusty and very valiant servant Salutes you like this with his free duty And begs you to believe him
It is certain then for Cyprus
Marcus Luccicos isn’t he in town
He's now in Florence
Write to him from us send it very very quickly
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor
Valiant Othello we must straight send you Against the general enemy Ottoman
I didn’t see you welcome gentle Signior We missed your advice and your help tonight
And I missed yours
Why what's the matter
My daughter
O my daughter
Dead
Whoever he is that in this disgusting event Has tricked your daughter of herself like this And you of her the bloody book of law You shall read yourself to the bitter letter of it As you see fit
Humbly I thank your grace
Here is the man this Moor who now it seems Has been brought here by Your special mandate for the state affairs
We are very sorry for it 
What in your own part can you say to this
Nothing but that this is so
Very potent grave and reverend signiors My very noble and approved good masters That I have taken away this old man's daughter Is very true true I have married her
I don’t speak well And I am little blessed with the soft phrase of peace Because since these arms of mine were seven years' old until now some nine months past they have used Their dearest actions on the battlefield And I can speak little of this great world Only what relates to feats of war and battle And therefore I shall grace my cause little By speaking for myself
Yet by your gracious patience I will deliver a round truthful tale Of my whole course of love by what drugs what charms What invocation and what mighty magic Because I am charged with such crimes I won his daughter
A maiden never bold Of a spirit so still and quiet that she blushed at her own Movements and she in spite of nature Of years of country reputation everything To fall in love with what she feared to look at
I therefore testify again That he worked on her with some mixtures powerful over the blood Or with some dram that produced this effect
To testify is not proof Without wider and more open tests Than these thin habits and poor probabilities Of modern liking prefer against him
But Othello speak
Did you by indirect and forced methods Subdue and poison this young maid's affections
Or did she ask for them with such a beautiful question As soul to soul allows
Fetch Desdemona here
Ensign go with them you know the place best
And until she comes as truly as I confess the vices of my blood to heaven So I'll present truthfully to your hearing How I thrived in this beautiful lady's love And she in mine
Tell it Othello
Her father loved me often invited me Still questioned me the story of my life From year to year the battles sieges fortunes That I have been in
To hear this Desdemona would seriously listen But still the house affairs would draw her away Which she would finish in a great hurry and She’d come again and eat up my stories With a greedy ear which I observing Once I took a rare hour and found good ways To draw a prayer of earnest enthusiasm from her So that I would lengthen all my stories Which she had already heard bits and pieces of But not all of them
I agreed And often I cheated her of her tears When I spoke of some distressful event I had suffered in my youth
This is the only witchcraft I have used
Here comes the lady let her verify it
I think this tale would win my daughter too
My noble father I see a divided duty here
To you I am bound for my life and education My life and education both teach me How to respect you you are the lord of duty I am therefore your daughter
But here's my husband And as much duty as my mother showed To you preferring you before her father So much I dispute that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord
God be with you
I’m done
For your sake jewel I am glad at soul I have no other child Because your escape would teach me tyranny To hang logs on them
I’m done my lord
Let me speak as you would and lay a sentence Which as a grace or step may help these lovers Into your favor
When remedies are too late griefs are ended By seeing the worst which hopes lately depended on
To mourn mischief that is over and gone Is the next way to create new mischief
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes it Patience makes a mockery of her injury
The victim that smiles steals something from the thief He robs himself that spends a unprofitable grief
These sentences to sweetness or to bitterness Being strong on both sides are equal
I humbly beg you proceed to the affairs of state
The Turk with very mighty preparation makes for Cyprus
Othello the strength of the place is best known to you and although we have there a force that is more than adequate yet public opinion a sovereign mistress of effects say we need a safer voice like you
You must therefore be content to conceal the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and violent expedition
The dictator custom very grave senators Has made the stone and steel couch of war My feather bed three times
I recognize A natural and prompt speed that I find in hardness and undertake These present wars against the Ottoman
Very humbly therefore bowing to your state I’d like proper provisions for my wife Proper respect for housing and subsidy With such accommodation and suitable company As is equal with her breeding
Nor I
Nor I I would not live there To put my father into violent thoughts By being always in his sight
Very gracious duke Listen with a gracious ear to my request And let me find a contract in your voice To assist my simpleness
What would you have Desdemona
That I loved the Moor to live with him My downright violence and storm of fortunes May shout to the world
So much so dear lords if I am left behind A moth of peace and he goes to the war The rites for which I love him I am deprived of And I shall endure a sad interval caused By his dear absence
Let me go with him
Let her have your votes
No when light winged toys Of feathered Cupid blind my knowing and Usual instruments of sight with unruly dullness That if my games corrupt and stain my work Let housewives make a skillet of my helmet And all indignities and base adversities Make a boil of my reputation
Tonight my lord
This night
With all my heart
At nine in the morning we'll meet here again
Othello leave some officer behind And he shall bring our commission to you With such things of quality and respect As are important to you
Let it be so
Good night to everyone
And noble Signior If virtue is missing delightful beauty Your son in law is far more just than black
Goodbye brave Moor be kind to Desdemona
My life on her faith in me
Iago
What do you say noble heart
What will I do do you think
Why go to bed and sleep
I will drown myself immediately
If you do I shall never love you after
Why you silly gentleman
It is silliness to live when to live is torment and then we have a prescription to die when death is our physician
O villainous
I have looked on the world for twenty eight years and since I could distinguish between a benefit and a disadvantage I’ve never found man that knew how to love himself
Before I would say I would drown myself for the love of a chicken I would exchange my humanity with a baboon
What should I do
I confess it is my shame to be so crazy in love but it is not in my virtue to fix it
Virtue
A fig
It is in ourselves that we are like this or like that
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to balance another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would lead us to very preposterous conclusions
It cannot be
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will
Come be a man
drown yourself
Drown cats and blind puppies
Put money in your purse follow the wars defeat your mood with an false beard I say put money in your purse
It had a violent beginning and you shall see an answerable separation  put only money in your purse These Moors are changeable in their wills
Fill your purse with money
The food that is now as luscious as locusts to him shall be shortly be as bitter as the bitter apple drug
If you must damn yourself do it a more delicate way than drowning
A pox on drowning yourself
It is clean out of the way
Rather seek to be hanged in planning your joy than to be drowned and go without her
Will you be committed to my hopes if I depend on you
I have told you often and I’ll tell you again and again I hate the Moor
My cause is fixed in my heart yours has no less reason
Let us be united in our revenge against him
If you can get his wife you do yourself a pleasure me a sport
There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered
Go ahead go provide your money
We will talk about this more of this tomorrow
Goodbye
Where shall we meet in the morning
At my lodging
I'll be with you soon
Go to farewell
Do you hear me Roderigo
What did you say
No more about drowning do you hear
This is the way I ever make my fool my purse Because I should abuse my own gained knowledge If I would waste time with such a fool Only for my sport and profit
I hate the Moor And it is widely thought that he has done my job Between my sheets
I don’t know if it is true But I will take it as a certainty just because of mere Suspicion in that way
He trusts me well The better my plan will work on him
Cassio's a proper man
Let me see now To get his place and to congratulate myself In double trickery How how
He has a person and a smooth disposition To be suspected framed to make women lie
The Moor is of a free and open nature That thinks men are honest that only seem to be so And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are
I have it
It is born
Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light
What can you discern at sea from the cape
Nothing at all
It is a very excited flood I cannot between the sky and the land See a sail
What shall we hear of this
If the Turkish fleet is not Sheltered and in a bay they are drowned It is impossible to wait it out
News lads
Our wars are over
How
Is this true
I am glad of it
He is a worthy governor But this same Cassio although he speaks of comfort Touching the Turkish loss he still looks sad And prays the Moor is safe because they were parted With an evil and violent tempest
Pray heavens he is Because I have served him and the man commands Like a full soldier
Come let's do so Because every minute is to expect More arrival
Thank you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor
O let the heavens Give him defense against the elements Because I have lost him on a dangerous sea
Does he have a good ship
His ship is heavily timbered and his captain is Very experienced and has a good reputation Therefore my hopes not excessively fed to death Stand in heavy anxiety
A sail a sail a sail
What noise
The town is empty on the seashore Ranks of people stand and they cry "A sail
I beg you sir go outside And give us truth about who it is that has arrived
I shall
But good lieutenant is your general married
How now
Who has put in
It is one Iago ensign to the general
Who is she
She that I spoke of our great captain's captain Left in the company of the bold Iago Whose footing here occurs earlier than the seven nights We thought it would take
Great Jove guard Othello And swell his sail with your own powerful breath That he may bless this bay with his tall ship Make love's quick breaths in Desdemona's arms Give renewed fire to our dead spirits And bring all Cyprus comfort
O behold The riches of the ship is come on shore
You men of Cyprus bend your knees
Hall to you lady
and the grace of heaven Before you behind you and on every hand Surround you
I thank you valiant Cassio
What news can you tell me of my lord
He is not yet arrived and I don’t know anything Only that he's well and will be here shortly
O but I fear how lost you each other
The great fight of the sea and skies Separated our fellowship
a sail
Look for the news
Good ensign you are welcome
Welcome mistress
Sir I wish she would give you as much of her lips As she often gives me of her tongu You'd have enough
Alas she has nothing to say
By Mary before your ladyship I grant She puts her voice a little in her heart And scolds by thinking
You don’t have reasonto say so
O damn you slanderer
You shall not write my praise
No don’t let me
What would you write about me if you should praise me
O gentle lady don’t ask me Because I am nothing if not critical
Yes madam
I am not merry but I cheat The thing I am by seeming otherwise
Come how would you praise me
I am about it but indeed my imagination Comes from my head as bird trap does from cloth It plucks out brains and all
But my inspiration works And she is delivered like this
If she is beautiful and wise beauty and wit The one's for use the other uses it
Well praised
What if she is black and witty
If she is black and also has a wit She'll find a white that will her blackness fit
Worse and worse
What if she is beautiful and foolish
She never was still foolish that was beautiful Because even her folly helped her have an heir
These are old wives’ tales to make fools laugh in the alehouse
What miserable praise have you for her that's ugly and foolish
You praise the worst best
But what praise could you bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit rightly wore the witnessing of very malice itself
To breastfeed fools and make a record of a little beer
O very lame and powerless conclusion
Don’t learn from him Emilia although he is your husband
What do you think Cassio
Isn’t he a very unholy and rude counselor
He speaks freely madam
You may appreciate him more as a soldier than as a scholar
With a web as little as this I’ll catch as big a fly as Cassio
Yes go ahead and smile on her I will trap you in your own courtship
You speak truly it is so indeed
If such tricks as these strip you of your lieutenantry it would’ve been better you hadn’t kissed your three fingers so often with which you are again very ready to play the gent
an excellent courtesy
it is so indeed
Still your fingers to your lips again
I wish they were hypodermics for your sake
The Moor
I know his trumpet
It is truly so
Let's meet him and greet him
Look where he is coming
O my beautiful warrior
My dear Othello
It surprises me as much as my joy To see you here before me
O my soul's joy
If after every storm such calms come May the winds blow until they have awakened death
And let the laboring ship climb hills of oceans As high as Olympus and duck down again as low As hell is from heaven
If I were to die now I could die very happy because I’m afraid My soul is so absolutely content That no other comfort like this one Can follow unknown death
The heavens forbid anything But our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days grow long
Amen to that sweet powers
I cannot speak enough of this contentment It stops me here it is too joyful
O you are well tuned now
But I'll tighten the strings that make this music Until it’s as honest as I am
Come let’s go to the castle
News friends our wars are done the Turks are drowned
Honey Cyprus will be very glad to see you I have found great love among them
O my sweet I chit chat unfashionably and I talk foolishly About my own comforts
Come Desdemona Once more happily brought to Cyprus
Meet me right away at the harbor
Come here
If you are valiant as they say corrupt men being in love have a nobility in their natures that is more than natural to them listen to me
The lieutenant is part of the court’s guard tonight
First I must tell you this Desdemona is directly in love with him
With him
Why it is not possible
Lay your finger like this and let your soul be instructed
Watch with what violence she first loved the Moor but with his bragging and telling her fantastic lies
will she still love him for chattering
Don’t your discreet heart think it
Her eye must be fed and what joy will she have to look on the devil
When the blood is made calm with playing there should be something to fire it up again and to satisfy a fresh appetite loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties all which the Moor lacks
Now sir this done as it is a very compelling and natural position who is outstanding and first in the degree of this luck as Cassio is
A very changeable rogue having no further conscience than assuming the mere form of civil and humane behavior for the better measure of his worth and very hidden loose affections
I cannot believe that in her she is full of very blessed qualities
Blessed my foot
She drinks wine just like everyone else
If she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor
Blessed pudding
Didn’t you see her play with the palm of his hand
Didn’t you see that
Yes I did but she was only being polite
I swear it’s a habitual lust a list and hidden opening to the history of lust and evil thoughts
They came so close with their lips that their breaths hugged each other
Villainous thoughts Roderigo
When these mutual things lead the way the teacher and the main exercise follow close behind to the obvious conclusion
Piss off
But sir Take my advice
I have brought you from Venice
Cassio doesn’t know you
I won’t be far from you
Find some occasion to make Cassio angry either by speaking too loud or insulting his discipline or from whatever reason you please which might be suggested by what’s happening at the time
Provoke him so that he will because even out of that I will make these men of Cyprus rebel whose character won’t come back to their original calmness unless Cassio is replaced
So you shall have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I would now have to advance them and the impediment very profitably removed without which we couldn’t expect to succeed
I guarantee you
Meet me later at the fortress
I must get his belongings ashore
Farewell
Goodbye
It is Othello's pleasure our noble and valiant general that on certain news now arrived concerning the mere total destruction of the Turkish fleet every man rejoice some to dance some to make bonfires each man to whatever sport and revels his disposition leads him because besides this good news it is the celebration of his wedding
His pleasure should be proclaimed this much
All offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five until the clock rings eleven
Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello
Iago has orders on what to do But nevertheless with my own eyes I will look to it myself
Iago is very honest
Michael good night
Tomorrow at your earliest Let me speak with you
Come my dear love The purchase made the fruits are to follow That profit is still to come between me and you
Good night
Welcome Iago we must go to the guard
Not this hour lieutenant it is not yet ten of the clock
Our general put us early like this for the love of his Desdemona whom we won’t blame
He hasn’t yet spent the wedding night with her and she is joy for the gods
She's a very exquisite lady
And I'll guarantee that she is full of game
Indeed she is a very fresh and delicate creature
What an eye she has
I think it looks like an invitation to excitement
An inviting eye and still I think it is properly modest
And when she speaks isn’t it a call to love
She is indeed perfection
Well happiness to their sheets
Come lieutenant I have a bottle of wine and here outside are a number of Cyprus gents that would happily drink a round to the health of black Othello
I could really wish manners would invent some other kind of entertainment
O they are our friends only one cup
I'll drink for you
I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily diluted too and behold what changes it makes here
I am unfortunate in the handicap and dare not tempt my weakness with any more wine
What man
Where are they
Here at the door I beg you call them in
I'll do it but it doesn’t like me
If I can get him to drink only one cup With the one he’s already drunk tonight He'll be as full of fighting and insults As my young mistress' dog
Now among this flock of drunkards I am make our Cassio do some action That may offend the isle
Some wine ho
And let me the small drink clink clink And let me the small drink clink
Before God an excellent song
I learned it in England where indeed they are very powerful drinkers
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking
Why he drinks your Dane dead drunk easily he doesn’t even sweat to defeat your German he makes your Hollander vomit before the next round can be poured
To the health of our general
King Stephen was a worthy peer His breeches only cost him a dollar He held them six cents all too expensive With that he called the calm tailor
Will you hear it again
It's true good lieutenant
For my own part no offense to the general nor any man of quality I hope to be saved
And so do I too lieutenant
Let's have no more of this let's to our affairs
Forgive us our sins
Gentlemen let's look to our business
I am not drunk now I can stand well enough and I speak well enough
Excellent well
and don’t only see his vice It is a proper contradiction to his virtue The one is as long as the other
It ‘s a pity of him
I fear the trust Othello puts him in because At some odd time of his infirmity he Will shake this island
But is he often like this
He'll watch the clock all night If drink doesn’t rock his cradle
It would be good To let the general know about it
Hey Roderigo
I pray you go after the lieutenant
What’s that noise
You rogue
You rascal
What's the matter lieutenant
A rogue teaching me my duty
I'll beat the rogue into a wicker bottle
Beat me
No good lieutenant I beg you sir stop
Let me go sir or I'll knock you over the head
Come on come on you're drunk
Drunk
What is the matter here
Zounds I bleed still I am hurt to the death
Hold for your lives
lieutenant  sir  Montano  gentlemen   Have you forgot all place of sense and duty
Hold
Why how now ho
What started this
Have we turned to Turks and do to ourselves What Heaven has forbidden the Ottoman
What is the matter gentlemen
Honest Iago looking dead with grieving Speak who began this
How is it Michael that you have forgotten yourself
I beg you pardon me I cannot speak
Worthy Montano you were inclined to be civil The world has marked he gravity and stillness of your youth and your name is great In mouths of wisest respect
What's the matter That you destroy your reputation like this And waste your reputation for the name Of a night brawler
Answer me
I don’t know anything That I said or did wrong this night Unless self love is sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves is a sin When we are attacked violently
Now by heaven My blood begins to rule my safer sense And passion having influenced my better judgment Tries to lead the way
If I once get angry And only lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my scolding
Let me know How this nasty fight began who started it And he that is guilty of this offense Even if he is my twin brother both born at the same time He’ll be finished with me
What
In a town of war Still waging the people's hearts brimful of fear To control private and domestic quarrels At night and on the court and guard of safety
It is monstrous
Iago who started it 
If partially connected or together in office You deliver more or less than truth You are no soldier
I’d rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio Still I convince myself speaking the truth Shall not wrong him
It’s like this general
Montano and myself were talking and There comes a fellow crying out for help With Cassio following him with determined sword To kill him
He fast of foot Outran me and I returned Because that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio swearing loudly which until tonight I never saw him do before
When I came back For this was brief  I found them close together Everyone was fighting even as again they were When you yourself parted them
I can’t report more of this matter But men are men the best sometimes forget themselves
Though Cassio did only little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe received Some strange insult From him that fled Which patience could not let him get away with
I know Iago Your honesty and love minimize this matter Making it easier for Cassio
Cassio I love you But never more be an officer of mine
Look my gentle love is awakened
I'll make you an example
What's the matter
All's well now sweetheart come away to bed
Sir for your hurts I myself will be your surgeon
Take him away
Iago look carefully about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl has upset
What are you hurt lieutenant
Yes beyond all cures
By Mary heaven forbid
Reputation reputation reputation
O I have lost my reputation
I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is beastly
My reputation Iago my reputation
As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation
Reputation is an idle and very false burden often got without merit and lost without being deserved
You have lost no reputation at all unless you believe yourself to be such a loser
What man
There are ways to regain the general again
You are now only fallen in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even as some one would beat his defenseless dog to scare an imperious lion
Talk to him again and he’ll like you again
I will rather seek to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer
Drunk
and talk like a parrot
and squabble
swagger
swear
and pick a fight with my own shadow
O you invisible spirit of wine if you don’t have a name to be known by let’s call you devil
Who were you following with your sword
What had he done to you
I don’t know
Is it possible
I remember a lot but nothing clearly a quarrel but not why
O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains
That we should with joy pleasure partying and applause transform ourselves into beasts
Why you’re sober enough now
How did you get this sober
Come you are too moral
As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not happen but since it is what it is fix it for your own good
I’ll ask him for my job back he’ll tell me I am a drunkard
If I had as many mouths as a seven headed goddess such an answer would shut them all
Now I’m a sensible man soon a fool and now a beast
O strange
Every uncontrolled cup is evil and the ingredient is a devil
Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it is well used
Say no more against it
And good lieutenant I think you think I love you
I have well proven it sir
I got drunk
You or any man living may be drunk at a time man
I'll tell you what you shall do
freely tell her the truth beg her help to put you in your place again
She is so free so kind so proper so blessed a disposition she holds it a sin in her goodness not to do more than she is asked
Beg her to fix this broken joint between you and her husband and I’ll bet against any thing worth naming this crack in your love shall grow stronger than it was before
You advise me well
No only in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
You are right
Good night lieutenant I must get going to the guard
Good night honest Iago
And who’s he then that says I play the villain
When this advice I give is free and honest Calculated to his thinking and indeed the way To win the Moor again
Because it is very easy To involve the listening Desdemona In any honest pursuit
She's been made as fruitful As the free elements
And then for her To win the Moor if it meant renouncing his own baptism All seals and symbols of forgiveness His soul is so chained to her love That she may make unmake do whatever she wants Even as her wishes shall play the god With his weak ability to think
How am I then a villain To advise Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good
Divinity of hell
So I will turn her virtue into black tar And out of her own goodness make the net That shall tangle them all up
What’s up Roderigo
I followed you here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but like the hunted by the hound
How poor are they who have no patience
What wound ever healed except bit by bit
You know we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on slow time
Doesn’t it go well
By the mass it is morning Pleasure and work make the hours seem short
Go get some sleep go where you are staying
Get going I say you shall know more later No get going
Gentlemen play here I will reward your pains Something that's brief and say “Good morning General” Hey fellows have your instruments been in Naples that they sound as horrible as like this
What sir how
Are these I beg you wind instruments
Yes by Mary they are sir
What “half the story” sir
By Mary sir by many a wind instrument that I know
Well sir we won’t
We don’t have any sir
Then put your pipes away in your bag because I'm leaving
Did you hear my honest friend
No I don’t hear your honest friend I hear you
I beg you keep up your jokes
There's a poor piece of gold for you
If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife is awake tell her there's one Cassio begs a little favor of speaking with her
Will you do this
Do my good friend
Good to see you Iago
You have not been to bed then
Why no the day dawned Before we parted
I have made bold Iago To send for your wife
My request to her Is that she will manage to get me access To virtuous Desdemona
I'll send her to you right away And I'll devise a plan to get the Moor Out of the way that your conversation and business May be more free
I humbly thank you for it
I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest
The general and his wife are talking about it And she strongly speaks up for you
The Moor replies That the man you hurt is very famous in Cyprus And has a great reputation and that in pure wisdom He might not refuse you but he protests he loves you And needs no other person begging than his own opinion To take the safest public occasion To bring you back again
Still I beg you If you think it’s okay or that it may be done Get me a chance to speak briefly With Desdemona alone
I beg you come in
I will hide you where you shall have time To speak your heart freely
Thank you so much
Well my good lord I'll do it
This fortification gentlemen shall we see it
We'll wait for your lordship
Be assured good Cassio I will do All I can in your behalf
O that's an honest fellow
Don’t doubt it Cassio That I will have my lord and you As friendly again as you were
Generous madam Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio He'll never be anything but your true servant
Yes but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed on such nice and light diet Or take itself so out of circumstance That with my absence and my place filled My general will forget my love and service
My lord shall never rest I'll watch him calmly and talk him out of patience His bed shall seem like a school his meals a confessional I'll intermingle everything he does With Cassio's suit
Therefore be happy Cassio Because your lawyer would rather die Than lose your case
Madam here comes My lord
Madam I'll leave
Why stay And listen to me speak
Madam not now
I am very uncomfortable Unfit for my own intentions
Well have it your way
Ha
I don’t like that
What did you say
Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife
Cassio my lord
No sure I cannot believe That he would steal away so guiltily Seeing you coming
I do believe it was he
How now my lord
I have been talking with a petitioner here A man that suffers greatly in your displeasure
Who is it you mean
Why your lieutenant Cassio
Didn’t he just leave
Yes truly so humbled That he has left part of his grief with me To suffer with him
Good love call him back
Not now sweet Desdemon some other time
But shall it be soon
The sooner sweet for you
Shall it be tonight at supper
No not tonight
Tomorrow night at dinner then
I won’t be eating at home I have to meet the captains at the fortress
in faith he's very sorry And yet his crime in our common reason Except that they say the wars must make examples Out of their best is not almost a fault To incur a private punishment
When shall he come
Tell me Othello
I wonder in my soul What you would ask me to do that I should deny Or stand so hesitant about
What
No when I have a favor to ask Where I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of confidence and heavy And fearful to be granted
Shall I deny you
No
farewell my lord
Emilia come
Be as your thoughts teach you Whatever you are I am obedient
Excellent wretch
Destruction take my soul But I do love you
and when I don’t love you Chaos comes back
Did Michael Cassio when you courted my lady Know about your love
He did from first to last
Why do you ask
Only to satisfy my thought No further harm
What bout your thought Iago
I didn’t think he had been acquainted with her
O yes and went between us very often
Indeed
Indeed
Yes indeed
Do you see anything in that
Isn’t he honest
Honest my lord
Honest
Yes honest
My lord for all I know
What do you think
Think my lord
Think my lord
By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thoughts Too hideous to be shown
What didn’t you like
If you do love me Tell me what you were thinking
My lord you know I love you
I think you do And because I know you are full of love and honesty And weigh your words carefully before saying them These stops of yours frighten me even more Because such things in a false disloyal rogue Are tricks of custom but in a man that's just They're hidden delays working from the heart That passion cannot control
For Michael Cassio I would swear I think that he is honest
I think so too
Men should be what they seem Or those that are not I wish wouldn’t seem so
Certainly men should be what they seem
Why then I think Cassio's an honest man
Speak my thoughts
Why what if they are vile and false Where's that palace that foul things sometimes intrude
Who has a breast so pure That some unclean thoughts Keep court records and legal holidays and sit in session With lawful deliberations
You conspire against your friend Iago If you only think him wronged and won’t let him be Anything but a stranger to your thoughts
I do beg you Although I am perhaps vicious in my guess As I confess it is a bad habit of mine To look deeply into wrongs and to find faults that aren’t By my jealousy that your wisdom still would take no Notice from one that so imperfectly imagines things Or create a problem for yourself Out of his scattered and unsure observations
It’s not good for your peace or your wellbeing Or for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts
What do you mean
By heaven I'll know you’re thinking
You cannot unless my heart were in your hand And that won’t happen while it is in my custody
Ha
That deceived man lives in bliss Who certain of his fate doesn’t love who wronged him But O what damned stories he tells about Who loves but doubts suspects but strongly loves
O misery
Why why is this
Do you think I'd make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions
Trade me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such puffed up and blown suspicions Matching your suggestion
It won’t make me jealous To say my wife is beautiful cooks well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous
And I won’t draw from my own weak merits The smallest fear or doubt of her turning against me Because she had eyes and chose me
No Iago I'll see before I doubt when I doubt I’ll need proof And on the proof there is no more but this To hell with love or jealousy at once
I’m glad to hear it because now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With a more open spirit
Therefore as I am supposed to Receive it from me
I don’t speak yet of proof
Look at your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye like this not jealous or secure
I know our country’s disposition well In Venice they let heaven see the pranks They wouldn’t dare show their husbands their best conscience Isn’t to leave it unfinished but to keep it unknown
You say so
She deceived her father by marrying you And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks She loved them most
And so she did
I am bound to you forever
I see this has dashed your spirits a little
Not a jot not a jot
Trust me I fear it has
I hope you will consider that what I have spoken Comes from my love but I see you're upset
I beg you not to push my speech To grosser issues or to reach beyond Mere suspicion
I will not
Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile things That my thoughts are not aimed at
No not too upset
I can only think that Desdemona's honest
Long live she so
and long live you to think so
But pardon me
I don’t have the position To speak knowingly of her although I may fear Her will rebelling against her better judgment May decide to match you with her countrymen And happily repent her ways
Leave me Iago
My lord I’m leaving
Why did I get married
This honest creature undoubtedly Sees and knows more much more than he reveals
In the meantime Please think I am too occupied with my fears As there are strong reasons to fear I am And consider her innocent I beg your honor
Don’t be afraid of what I think
Once more I’m leaving
This fellow's exceedingly honesty And knows all qualities with an educated spirit Of human dealings
If I prove her unfaithful Although that her leashes were my dear heartstrings I'd suddenly go away and let her follow the wind To plunder fortune
O curses on marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not control their appetites
I had rather be a toad And live on the air of a dungeon Than keep a piece of the thing I love For others' uses
Still it is the plague of great men They have fewer choices than common men It is an unshakeable destiny like death
I'll not believe it
How are you my dear Othello
Your dinner and the generous islanders You invited wait for your presence
I am to blame
Why do you speak so softly
Are you unwell
I have a pain on my forehead here
Come I'll go in with you
I am very sorry that you are not well
I'll have the embroidery taken out And give it Iago
What he will do with it heaven knows I don’t I only give it to him to please him
Don’t scold I have something for you
A thing for me
It is a common thing… Ha
To have a foolish wife
O is that all
What will you give me now For that same handkerchief
What handkerchief
What handkerchief
Why the one that the Moor first gave to Desdemona The one that you asked me so often to steal
Have you stolen it from her
Look here it is
A good wench give it to me
What will you do with it that you have been so eager For me to steal it
Why what's that to you
If it’s not for an important purpose Give it back to me again
Poor lady she'll run mad When she misses it
Mind your own business  I have use for it
Go leave me
I will put this napkin in Cassio's room And let him find it
Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy drugs of the world Shall ever bring you that sweet sleep Which you had yesterday
Why how are you general
No more of that
Go away
Be gone
What my lord
What sense did I have of her stolen hours of lust
I am sorry to hear this
I would’ve been happy if the entire camp Pioneers and all had tasted her sweet body As long as I didn’t know about it
O now forever Farewell to the peaceful mind
Farewell happiness
Farewell to the plumed forces and the big wars That make ambition a virtue
O farewell Farewell the neighing horse and the shrill trumpet The spirit stirring drum the ear piercing fife The royal banner and all goodness Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
And O you mortal device whose rude throats Pretend to be the immortal Jove's dread clamors Farewell
Othello's occupation's gone
Is it possible my lord
Villain be sure you prove my love a whore Be sure of it
Give me the proof I can see Or by the worth of man's eternal soul You would’ve been better born a dog Than answer my aroused anger
Has it come to this
Make me see it  or at the least prove it so That the accusation has no hinges or loops To hang a doubt on or woe on your life
O grace
O heaven defend me
Are you a man
Have you got a soul or sense
God be with you take my job
O wretched fool That lives to make your honesty a vice
O monstrous world
Take note take note O world To be direct and honest is not safe
I thank you for this lesson and from this point forward I'll love no friend since love breeds such contempt
I should be wise because honesty's a fool And loses what it works for
By the world I think my wife is honest and think she is not I think that you are just and think you are not
I'll have some proof
Her name that was as fresh As Diana's face is now as grimy and black As my own face
If there are ropes or knives Poison or fire or suffocating streams I'll not endure it
I wish I were satisfied
You would be satisfied
Would
No I will
And may
But how
How satisfied my lord
Death and damnation
O
It’s a lengthy problem I think To bring them to that event
Damn them then If ever mortal eyes see them in any bed Other than their own
What then
How then
What shall I say
Where's satisfaction
It is impossible that you should see this If they were as prime as goats as hot as monkeys As salty as wolves in a pride and fools as disgusting As ignorance made drunk
But still I say If suggestion and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction you may have it
Give me a living reason why she's unfaithful
I don’t like the job But since I am entered already so far into this cause Encouraged to it by foolish honesty and love I will go on
I slept with Cassio lately And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep
No this was only his dream
And this may help to support other proofs That look questionable
I'll tear her all to pieces
Tell me but this Haven’t you sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand
I gave her such a one it was my first gift
Now I see it is true
Arise black vengeance from your hollow hell
Yield up O love your crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate
Swell bosom with your fury Because it is from lavender’s tongues
Yet calm down
O blood Iago blood
Patience I say your mind may perhaps change
Let him command And it shall be penance for me to obey Whatever the bloody business is
Damn her lewd cat
O damn her
Come go aside with me I will leave so I can Equip me with some swift means of death For the beautiful devil
Now you are my lieutenant
I am your own forever
Do you know servant where Lieutenant Cassio lies
I dare not say he lies anywhere
Why man
He's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing him
To tell you where he lives is to tell you where I lie
Can anything be made out of this
I don’t know where he lives and for me to make up a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there is to lie in my own throat
Can you ask about him and be satisfied by the reports
I will preach to the world for him that is make questions and answer them
Seek him bid him come here
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
To do this is within the scope of man's wit and therefore I will attempt to do it
Where should I have lost that handkerchief Emilia
I don’t know madam
Believe me I would rather have lost my purse Full of money and except that my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such lowness As jealous creatures are it would be enough To put him to ill thinking
Isn’t he jealous
Who he
I think the sun where he was born Took all such humors out of him
Look here he comes
I will not leave him now until Cassio Is called to him
How is it with you my lord
Well my good lady
O hardness to lie
How are you Desdemona
Well my good lord
Give me your hand
This hand is moist my lady
This hand of yours requires A vacation from liberty fasting and prayer Much punishment holy exercise Because here's a young and sweating devil here That commonly rebels
It is a good hand An open one
You may indeed say so Because it was that hand that gave away my heart
A liberal hand
The hearts of old gave hands But our new code of behavior is hands not hearts
I cannot speak about this
Come now your promise
What promise dear
I have sent to bid Cassio to come and speak with you
I have salty and sorry tears that bother me Lend me your handkerchief
Here my lord
The one I gave you
I don’t have it with me
No
No faith my lord
That is a mistake
An Egyptian Gave that handkerchief to my mother She cast charms and could almost read The thoughts of people
She told her that while she kept It it would make her sweet and soften my father Entirely to her love but if she lost it Or made a gift of it my father's eye Should see her as hateful and his spirits should hunt After new loves
My mother dying gave it to me And asked me when my fate would have me marry To give it to my wife
Is it possible
Indeed
Is it true
Very true therefore look well for it
Then I wish to God that I had never seen it
Ha
Why
Why do you speak so haltingly and angrily
Is it lost
Is it gone
Speak is it missing
Heaven bless us
What do you say
It is not lost but what if it were
How
I say it is not lost
Go get it let me see it
Why so I can sir but I won’t now
This is a trick to distract me from my request
I beg you let Cassio be welcomed again
Come come You'll never meet a more capable man
The handkerchief
A man that all his life Has founded his good fortunes on your love Shared dangers with you The handkerchief
In truth you are to blame
Go away
This man isn’t jealous
I never saw this before
Surely there's some magic in this handkerchief I am very unhappy at the loss of it
Go and beg her
Hello good Cassio
what's the news with you
I would not be delayed
Alas thrice gentle Cassio
My pleading is out of tune right now My lord is not my lord and I wouldn’t know him If he were he in favor as changed in disposition
So every holy spirit help me As I have spoken all my best for you And stood shocked at his displeasure Over my free speech
You must be patient a while
What I can do I will and I will do as much more Than I dare do for myself
Let that satisfy you
Is my lord angry
He went just left And certainly in a strange state of upset
Can he be angry
Something of the moment then
I beg you do so
Surely it’s some matter of state Either from Venice or some minor problem Shown to him here in Cyprus That has muddied his clear spirit and in such cases Men's natures fight with inferior things Although their object is great ones
It’s even so true That we let our finger ache and it infects Our other healthful members even to the point Of pain
Scold me a lot Emilia I was unhandsome warrior as I am Charging his unkindness with a crime of my soul But now I find I had falsely testified And he's falsely accused
Pray heaven it is state matters as you think And no plot or no jealous reason Concerning you
Alas the day I never gave him reason
But jealous souls will not be answered that way They are not ever jealous for a reason But jealous because they are jealous
it is a monster Fathered by itself born of itself
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind
Lady amen
I’ll go find him
Cassio walk around here
If I do find him fit I'll ask for your favor And try to get it done the best way I can
I humbly thank your ladyship
Save you friend Cassio
What are doing away from home
How are you my very beautiful Bianca
Actually sweet love I was just coming to your house
Seven days and nights
One hundred sixty eight hours
and lovers' absent hours Being more tedious than the clock one hundred sixty times
O weary calculations
O Cassio where did you get this
This is some gift from a newer girlfriend
Well well
Come one woman
Throw your vile guesses into the devil's teeth From where you got them
You are jealous now That this is from some mistress some gift
Why whose is it
I don’t know either
I found it in my bedroom
I really like the work
Leave you
Why
I’m waiting here for the general And I don’t think it would help and it’s not my wish To have him see me talking with a woman
Why I beg you
Not that I don’t love you
But it’s that you don’t love me
I beg you walk with me on the way a little And say if I shall see you later tonight
That’s very good I must be patient
Will you think so
Think so Iago
What To kiss in private
An unauthorized kiss
Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more not meaning any harm
Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm
Why then it is hers my lord and being hers She may I think give it to any man
Yes what of that
That's not so good now
What If I had said I had seen him do you wrong
He has my lord but be well assured No more than he'll deny
What has he said
Faith that he did I don’t know what he did
What
what
With her on her whatever you want to think
that's sickening
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some reason
It is not words that shake me like this
Rubbish
Noses ears and lips
Is it possible
O devil
Work on My medicine work
Believing fools are caught like this And many worthy and chaste dames just like this All innocent meet punishment
What ho
my lord
my lord I say
Othello
How are you Cassio
What's the matter
Rub him around the temples
Step aside and hide yourself a little while He will recover right away
When he is gone I would like to speak with you urgently
How is it general
Haven’t hurt your head
Do you make fun of me
I make fun of you
No by heaven
I wish you would bear your luck like a man
An adulterer's a monster and a beast
There's many a beast then in a crowded city And many a civil monster
Did he confess it
Good sir be a man Do you think every bearded fellow that wears a harness May be driven by you
There's millions now alive That nightly lie in those adulterous beds which they dare To swear is the first time
Your case is better
O it is the spite of hell the fiend's high mockery To kiss a whore on a safe couch And to suppose her to be chaste
No let me know And knowing what I am I know what she shall be
O you are wise that is certain
Stand you aside a while Restrict yourself only in patient way
While you were being overwhelmed here by your grief A passion very unsuitable to such a man Cassio came here
I sent him away And gave him a good excuse for your fit I told him to come back soon and speak here with me Which he promised to do
Only hide yourself And mark the sneers the taunts and outstanding scorns That dwell in every region of his face Because I will make him tell the story as if it were new About where how how often how long ago and when He has had and is again to have sex with your wife
By Mary have patience Or I shall say you are totally in a temper And not a man
Do you hear me Iago
There’s nothing wrong with that But still be patient in all
Will you leave and hide
Now I will question Cassio about Bianca A housewife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio as it is the whore's disease To trick many and be tricked by one
He when he hears of her cannot refrain From excessive laughter
Here he comes
As he smiles Othello shall go crazy And his ignorant jealousy must interpret Poor Cassio's smiles gestures and happy behavior All wrong
How are you now lieutenant
The worse that you give me the additional information Whose lack of information even kills me
Persist with Desdemona well and you are sure of it
Now if this promise was in Bianca's power How quickly you would you succeed
Alas poor wretch
Look how he laughs already
I never knew a woman could love man so
Alas poor rogue
I think in faith she loves me
Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
Do you hear me Cassio
Now he urges him To tell it again
Do it it’s well said well said
Ha ha ha
Do you win Roman
Do you win
Me marry her
What
A customer
I beg you have some charity for my wit don’t think it is so unwholesome
ha ha ha
So so so so
They laugh that win
Faith the rumor goes that you shall marry her
I beg you tell the truth
I am a very villain if I don’t
Have you played me
Well
This is the monkey's own rumor
She is persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out because of my promise
Iago beckons me now he begins the story
She was here even now she haunts me in every place
So hangs and lolls and weeps on me so hales and pulls me
Ha ha ha
Now he tells how she brought him to my bedroom
O I see that nose of yours but not that dog I shall throw it to
Well I must leave her company
Before me
Look here she comes
It’s another such polecat
By Mary a perfumed one
What do you mean by this haunting of me
Let the devil and his dam haunt you
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you just gave me
I was a fine fool to take it
I must take out the embroidery
A likely piece of work that you should find it in your bedroom and not know who left it there
This is some cat's gift and I must take out the work
There give it to your whore
Wherever you had it I won’t take out any embroidery
Come now my sweet Bianca
Come now
Come now
By heaven that’s my handkerchief
If you'll come to supper tonight you may if you will not come when you are next ready to
After her after her
Faith I must or else she'll raise a ruckus in the street
Will you have dinner there
Faith I intend to
Well I maybe I’ll see you because I would very gladly speak with you
I beg you come will you
OK say no more
How shall I murder him Iago
Did you see how he laughed at his sin
O Iago
And did you see the handkerchief
Was that mine
Yours I swear
And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife
She gave it him and he has given it his whore
I would take nine years to kill him
A fine woman
A beautiful woman
A sweet woman
No you must forget that
Yes let her rot and die and be damned tonight because she shall not live
No my heart is turned to stone I hit it and it hurts my hand
O the world has not a sweeter creature
She might lie by an emperor's side and order him to work
No that's not your way
Hang her
I only say what she is
O she will sing the savageness out of a bear
Of so high and full intelligence and imagination
She's the worse for all this
O a thousand a thousand times
and then of so gentle a disposition
Yes too gentle
No that's certain
but yet the pity of it Iago
O Iago the pity of it Iago
If you’re so fond of her sin give her permission to offend because if it doesn’t affect you it affects nobody
I will chop her into pieces
Unfaithful to me
O it is evil in her
With my officer
That's even more evil
Get me some poison Iago this night
I'll not argue with her should her body and beauty change my mind again
And for Cassio let me be his undertaker
You shall hear more by midnight
Excellent good
A trumpet within
What trumpet is that one
Something from Venice surely
It is Lodovico Come from the duke
And see your wife is with him
God save you worthy general
With all my heart sir
The duke and senators of Venice greet you
I kiss the instrument of their desires
And what's the news good cousin Lodovico
I am very glad to see you Signior Welcome to Cyprus
I thank you
How does Lieutenant Cassio
He lives sir
Cousin there's an angry break up that’s fallen between him and my lord but you shall make all well
Are you sure of that
My lord
Is there division between my lord and Cassio
A very unhappy one
I would do a lot To reconcile them for the love I bear to Cassio
Fire and brimstone
My lord
Are you wise
What is he angry
May be the letter upset him Because I think they command him to come home Making Cassio governor in his place
Trust me I am glad about it
Indeed
My lord
I am glad to see you angry
I have not deserved this
My lord this would not be believed in Venice Although I could swear I saw it
O devil devil
If the earth could be flooded with woman's tears Each drop she lets fall would prove to be a crocodile
Out of my sight
I will not stay to offend you
Mistress
My lord
What do you want with her sir
Who I my lord
Proceed with your tears
I am commanded home
Go away I'll send for you soon
Sir I obey the mandate And will return to Venice
Away get going
Cassio shall take my place
And sir tonight I beg you that we may dine together
You are welcome sir to Cyprus
Goats and monkeys
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Said had it all
Is this the nature That passion could not shake
Whose solid virtue Could be neither grazed nor pierced by The shot of accident or dart of fate
He is very changed
Is he sane
He’s not sick in the brain
He's what he is
What strike his wife
Faith that was not good still I wish I knew if That stroke would prove to be the worst
Is it his habit
Or did the letters work on his blood And newly create this fault
Alas alas
It is not honesty in me to discuss What I have seen and known
I am sorry that I was wrong about him
You have seen nothing then
Not ever heard or ever suspected
Yes you have seen Cassio and her together
But then I saw no harm and then I heard Each syllable that was exchanged between them
What did they never whisper
Never my lord
Nor send you out of the way
Never
To fetch her fan her gloves her mask or anything
Never my lord
That's strange
I dare my lord to bet that she is honest Burn me at the stake
If any wretch has put this in your head Let heaven repay them with the serpent's curse
Because if she is not honest chaste and true There's no man happy the purest of their wives Is wicked as the leis about them
She says enough yet she's a simple rabbit That cannot say as much
My lord what is your will
Please dear come here
What is your pleasure
Let me see your eyes Look into my face
What horrible desire is this
On my knees what does your speech mean
I understand a fury in your words But not the words
Why what are you
Your wife my lord Your true and loyal wife
Come swear it damn yourself Lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves Should fear to seize you
Therefore be double damned Swear you are honest
Heaven does truly know it
Heaven truly knows that you are as false as hell
To whom my lord
With whom
How am I false
O Desdemona
Away
Away
Away
Alas the heavy day
Why do you cry
Am I the motive for these tears my lord
If you maybe suspect my father is An instrument of this calling you back Don’t lay your blame on me
If you have lost him Why I have lost him too
Or keep it as a jug to hold dirty toads To knot and give birth in
Turn your face there Patience you young and rose lipped archangel Yes there look as grim as hell
I hope my noble lord believes I am faithful
O yes as summer flies are in the swamps That move quickly even with blowing
O you weed Who are so lovely beautiful and smell so sweet That the sense aches at you I wish you had never been born
Alas what ignorant sin have I committed
Was this beautiful paper this very excellent book Made to write “whore” on
What sin committed
Committed
O you public commoner
I should make very fires of my cheeks Burn modesty into ashes If I only spoke your deeds
What committed
Heaven thumbs its nose at it and the moon winks The obscene wind that kisses all it meets Is quiet within the hollow tunnels of earth And will not hear it
What committed
Impudent prostitute
By heaven you do me wrong
Aren’t you a prostitute
No as I am a Christian
If to preserve this body for my lord From any other evil unlawful touch Is not to be a prostitute I am none
What not a whore
No as I shall be saved
Is it possible
O heaven forgive us
You mistress That have the office next to Saint Peter And keep the gate of hell
You you yes you
Alas what does this gentleman mean
How are you madam
How are you my good lady
Faith half asleep
Good madam what's the matter with my lord
With who
Why with my lord madam
Who is your lord
He that is yours sweet lady
I have none
Don’t talk to me Emilia I cannot weep and I don’t have any answers Except what should go by water
I beg you tonight Lay my wedding sheets on my bed remember
And I’ll call your husband here
Here's a change indeed
It’s right I should be used this way very right
How have I behaved that he might put The smallest opinion on my least misconduct
What is your pleasure madam
How is it with you
I cannot tell
What's the matter lady
Alas Iago my lord has accused her of being a prostitute Thrown such angry and horrible words at her As true hearts cannot bear
Am I that name Iago
What name beautiful lady
Such as she says my lord said I was
Why did he do it
I don’t know I am sure I am no one like that
Don’t weep don’t weep
alas the day
She has abandoned so many noble matches Her father and her country and her friends To be called whore
Wouldn’t it make one weep
It is my wretched luck
How did this trick come on him
No only heaven knows
I will be hanged if some eternal villain Some busy and insinuating rogue Some scheming lying slave to get some job Hasn’t made up this slander or else I'll be hanged
Damn there is no such man it is impossible
If there is a man like that heaven pardon him
A noose pardon him
And hell chew on his bones
Why should he call her whore
who keeps her company
What place
what time
what form
what likelihood
The Moor's abused by some very villainous rogue Some base notorious rogue some scurvy fellow
O heaven that you would expose such companions And put a whip in every honest hand To whip the rascals naked throughout the world Even from the east to the west
Speak behind the door
O damn on them
He was some such squire That turned your wit inside out And made you to suspect me of sleeping with the Moor
You are a fool be quiet
Alas Iago What shall I do to win my lord again
Good friend go to him because by this light of heaven I don’t know how I lost him
Unkindness may do much And his unkindness may kill my life But never taint my love
If it were any other… It’s only that I guarantee it
Listen how these instruments summon us to supper
What now Roderigo
I don’t believe that you deal justly with me
On the contrary
Every day you get me out of the way with some plan Iago and rather as it seems to me now keep from me all convenience than supplies me with the least advantage of hope
Will you listen to me Roderigo
I’ve heard too much already because your words and actions don’t agree with each other
You accuse me most unjustly
With nothing but truth
I have wasted myself out of my money
The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a nun
Well OK very well
Very well
OK
I cannot “OK” man and it is not very well
No I say it is very contemptible and begin to find myself fooled by it
Very well
I tell you it is not very well
You have said so
Yes and said nothing except that which I have every intention of doing
Why now I see there's spirit in you and even from this instant you build a better opinion of yourself than ever before
Give me your hand Roderigo
You have taken a very just exception against me but still I protest I have dealt very directly concerning your affair
It doesn’t seem so
I grant indeed it hasn’t seemed so and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment
Well what is it
Is it within reason and can be done
Sir there is special commission come from Venice to put Cassio in Othello's place
Is that true
Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice
O no He goes into Mauritania and takes the beautiful Desdemona away with him unless his living here can be delayed by some accident which no one can be so determined about removing of Cassio
How do you mean removing of him
Why by making him incapable of Othello's place knocking his brains out
And you would have me do that
Yes if you dare to do yourself a profit and a right
He eats tonight with a harlot and I will go there to him
He doesn’t know yet about his honorable fortune
Come stand not amazed at it but go along with me I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to kill him
It is now high dinner time and the night is being wasted
Let’s go
I will hear further reason for this
And you shall be satisfied
I do beg you sir trouble yourself no further
O pardon me it will do me good to walk
Madam good night I humbly thank your ladyship
Your honor is very welcome
Will you walk sir
My lord
I will my lord
How goes it now
He looks gentler than he did
Dismiss me
It was his bidding therefore good Emilia Give me my nightgown and goodbye
We must not now displease him
I wish you had never seen him
So do I
My love forgives him so That even his stubbornness his checks his frowns I beg you unpin my hair have grace and favor in them
I have put on those sheets you asked me to
Makes no difference
Good faith how foolish are our minds
If I die before you I beg you shroud me In one of those same sheets
Come come how you talk
My mother had a maid called Barbara She was in love and the man she loved went crazy And left her
She had a song of "willow" It was an old thing but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it
I beg you leave
Shall I go get your nightgown
No unpin my hair
This Lodovico is a proper man
A very handsome man
He speaks well
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his lower lip
The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree Sing all a green willow Her hand on her breast her head on her knee Sing willow willow willow
It's the wind
I called my love false love but what said he then
My eyes itch Does that predict tears
it is neither here nor there
I have heard it said so
O these men these men
Do you in conscience think tell me Emilia That there are women who abuse their husbands In such a disgusting way
There are some such no doubt
Would you do such a deed for all the world
Why wouldn’t you
No by this heavenly light
Nor I neither by this heavenly light I might do it as well in the dark
Would you do such a deed for all the world
The world's a huge thing it is a great price to pay For a small sin
In truth I think you wouldn’t
In truth I think I should and undo it when I had done
By Mary I wouldn’t do such a thing for a gold ring or for measures of soft cotton or for gowns petticoats or caps or any little show but for the whole world  why who wouldn’t unfaithful to her husband to make him a king
I would risk purgatory for it
Curse me if I would do such a wrong thing for the whole world
Why the wrong is but a wrong in the world and having the world for your work it is a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make it right
I don’t think there is any such woman
Yes a dozen and as many to profit as would store the world they played for
What is it that they do when they exchange us for others
Is it sport
I think it does
Is it frailty makes mistakes like this
It’s so too
And haven’t we got affections desires for sport and frailty as men have
Good night good night
heaven me send such usage Not to pick bad from bad but to change my ways by bad
Quickly quickly fear nothing I'll be at your elbow
It makes us or it ruins us think on that And make your resolution very firm
Be near at hand I mess it up
Go forth my sword he dies
I have rubbed this young pimple almost to the purpose And he grows angry
Now whether or not he kills Cassio Or Cassio him or each do kill the other I gain in every way
Live Roderigo He calls me to give back all Of gold and jewels that I robbed from him As gifts to Desdemona It can’t happen
If Cassio lives He has a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly and besides the Moor May disclose me to him I stand there in great danger No he must die
I know his walk it is he
Villain you die
O I am slain
I am maimed forever
Help ho
murder
murder
O villain that I am
It is even so
O help ho
light
a surgeon
It is he
O brave Iago honest and just That have such noble sense of your friend's wrong
Prostitute I’m coming
Those charms your eyes are erased from my heart Your bed lust stained shall be spotted with lust's blood
What ho
no guard
no safety
murder
murder
It is some misfortune the cry is very sorrowful
O help
Listen
O wretched villain
Nobody comes
Then I shall bleed to death
Listen
Here's someone comes in his shirt with light and weapons
Who's there
Didn’t you hear a cry
Here here
For heaven's sake help me
What's the matter
This is Othello's ensign as I take it
The same indeed a very valiant fellow
Who are you here that cry so grievously
Iago
O I am attacked undone by villains
Give me some help
O me lieutenant
What villains have done this
I think that one of them is still around here And cannot make a getaway
O treacherous villains
Who are you there
Come in and give some help
O help me here
That's one of them
O murderous slave
O villain
O damned Iago
O inhuman dog
Kill men in the dark
Where are these bloody thieves
How silent is this town
Ho
murder
murder
What are you
are you of good or evil
As you shall prove us to be praise us
Signior Lodovico
He sir
I be your mercy
Here's Cassio hurt by villains
Cassio
How is it brother
My leg is cut in two
By Mary heaven forbid
What is the matter ho
Who is it that cried
Who is it that cried
O my dear Cassio my sweet Cassio
O Cassio Cassio Cassio
O notable prostitute
Cassio do you any idea Who they are that have mangled you like this
No
Lend me a garter
So
O for a chair To carry him easily from here
Alas he faints
O Cassio Cassio Cassio
Gentlemen all I suspect this trash To be a party to this injury
Patience awhile good Cassio
Come come Lend me a light
Do we know this face or not
Alas my friend and my dear countryman Roderigo
No
Yes surely O heaven
Roderigo
What of Venice
Even he sir
did you know him
Know him
Yes
Signior Gratiano
I beg your gentle pardon These bloody accidents must excuse my manners That so neglected you
O a chair a chair
Roderigo
He he it is he
Some good men carry him carefully from here I'll fetch the general's surgeon
For you mistress save you your labor
None in the world I don’t know the man
What do you look pale
O carry him out of the air
Stay you good gentlemen
Do you Look pale mistress
Do you see the ghastliness of her eye
No if you stare we shall hear more soon
Watch her well I beg you look after her
Do you see gentlemen
No guiltiness will speak Even if tongues are out of use
Alas what's the matter
What's the matter husband
Alas good gentleman
Alas good Cassio
This is the fruit of whoring
I beg you Emilia Go find out about Cassio where he had dinner tonight
What you shake at that
He dined at my house but I don’t shake because of that
O did he
I charge you go with me
Damn damn you prostitute
I am no prostitute but have life as honest As you that abuse me like this
As I
damn
damn you
Kind gentlemen let's go see poor Cassio bandaged
Come mistress you must tell us another tale
Emilia run to the fortress And tell my lord and lady what has happened
Will you go ahead
Aside
This is the night That either makes me or breaks me
It is the cause
Still I won’t shed her blood Or scar that skin of hers whiter than snow And as smooth as the marble that makes monuments
Yet she must die or else she'll betray more men
Put out the light and then put out the light
O balmy breath that almost persuades Justice to break her sword
One more one more Be like this when you are dead and I will kill you And love you after
One more and this is the last So sweet was never so fatal
She awakes
Who's there
Othello
Yes Desdemona
Will you come to bed my lord
Have you prayed tonight Desdemona
Yes my lord
If you can think of any crime Not yet confessed to heaven and grace Do it right away
Alas my lord what do you mean by that
I would not kill your soul
You talk about killing
Yes I do
Then heaven Have mercy on me
Amen with all my heart
If you say so I hope you will not kill me
Hum
And yet I fear you because you are deadly When your eyes roll so
Why I should fear I don’t know Since I don’t know guiltiness but yet I feel I fear
Think on your sins
They are loves I bear to you
Yes and for that you die
That death is unnatural that kills for loving
Alas why do you chew your nether lip so
Peace and be quiet
I will do so
What's the matter
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave you You gave to Cassio
No by my life and soul
Send for the man and ask him
Sweet soul take care Take care of perjury you are on your death bed
Yes but not to die yet
You are to die
Then Lord have mercy on me
I say amen
And you have mercy too
I never Offended you in my life never loved Cassio Except with such general lawfulness of heaven As I might love
I never gave him gifts
By heaven I saw my handkerchief in his hand
O lying woman
He found it then I never gave it to him
He has confessed
What my lord
That he has used you
How
Unlawfully
Yes
He will not say so
No his mouth is stopped Honest Iago has taken orders for it
O my fear interprets
What is he dead
Had all his hairs been lives my great revenge Had stomach for them all
Alas he is betrayed and I have no hope
Out prostitute
You weep for him to my face
O banish me my lord but don’t kill me
Down prostitute
Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
No if you strive… But half an hour
Being done there is no pause
But while I say one prayer
It is too late
My lord my lord
what ho
my lord my lord
What noise is this
Not dead
Not yet quite dead
I who is cruel am yet merciful I would not have you linger in your pain
So so
What ho
my lord my lord
Who's there
O my good lord I would speak with you
By and by
She's dead
Ha
no more moving
As still as the grave
Shall she come in
Were it good
I think she moves again
No
What's best to do
If she comes in she'll surely speak to my wife
My wife
my wife
what wife
I have no wife
O unbelievable
O heavy hour
I think there should now be a huge eclipse Of sun and moon and that the frightened globe Should yawn at changes
I beg you To let me speak with you O my good lord
I had forgotten about you
O come in Emilia
Softly by and by
Let me draw the curtains
Where are you
What's the matter with you now
O my good lord there's foul murders done over there
What now
Just now my lord
It is the very mistake of the moon She comes more nearer earth than she usually does And makes men mad
Cassio my lord has killed a young Venetian Called Roderigo
Roderigo killed
And Cassio killed
No Cassio is not killed
Cassio not killed
Then murder's out of tune And sweet revenge grows harsh
O falsely falsely murdered
Alas what cry is that
That
what
Out and alas
That was my lady's voice
Help
help ho
help
O lady speak again
Sweet Desdemona
O sweet mistress speak
I die an innocent death
O who has done this deed
Nobody I myself
O farewell
Why should she be murdered
Alas who knows
You heard her say it herself it wasn’t I
O she is more the angel And you the blacker devil
She turned to folly and she was a whore
You lie about her and you are a devil
She was false as water
You are impatient as fire to say That she was false
O she was heavenly true
Cassio screwed her ask your husband otherwise
O I was damned beneath all the depths of hell And I proceeded on just grounds To this extremity
Your husband knew it all
My husband
Your husband
That she was unfaithful in marriage
Yes with Cassio
No had she been true If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect crystal I wouldn’t have sold her for it
My husband
My husband
Why do you repeat it woman
I said your husband
O mistress villainy has made fun with love
My husband said that she was unfaithful
He woman I say your husband
Do you understand the word
My friend your husband honest honest Iago
If he said so may his evil soul Rot half a grain a day
He lies to the heart
She was too fond of her very filthy bargain
Ha
Peace you’d better stop
You have not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt
O fool
O idiot
As stupid as dirt
You have done a deed I don’t care about your sword I'll make you famous Although I lose twenty lives
Help
help ho
help
The Moor has killed my mistress
murder murder
What is the matter
What’s wrong general
O are you here Iago
You have done well That men must lay their murders on your neck
What is the matter
Speak because my heart is full
I told him what I thought and told no more Than what he himself discovered was right and true
But did you ever tell him she was unfaithful
I did
You told a lie an stinking damned lie On my soul a lie a wicked lie
She unfaithful with Cassio
Did you say with Cassio
With Cassio mistress
Watch it control your tongue
I will not control my tongue I have to speak
My mistress lies here murdered in her bed
O heavens forbid
And your stories have egged the murder on
It is a strange truth
O monstrous act
Villainy villainy villainy
I think about it I think I smell it  O villainy
What are you crazy
I order you go home
Maybe Iago I will never go home
O
O
O
No lay down and roar Because you have killed the sweetest innocent That ever lifted open eyes
O she was evil
I scarcely knew you uncle there lies your niece Whose breath indeed these hands have just stopped
I know this act looks horrible and grim
Poor Desdemona
It was a handkerchief an antique token My father gave my mother
O heaven
O heavenly powers
Come hold your peace
It will be out it will be out
Me quiet
Be wise and go home
I will not
Damn
Your sword on a woman
O you stupid Moor
That handkerchief you speak of I found by luck and gave it to my husband Because he begged me to steal it Often with a solemn earnestness More than indeed belonged to such a trifle
Villainous whore
She give it Cassio
No alas I found it And I gave it to my husband
Filth you lie
By heaven I don’t I don’t gentlemen
O murderous simpleton
What should such a fool Do with so good a wife
Are there no stones in heaven To serve as thunder
Precious villain
The woman falls surely he has killed his wife
Yes yes
O lay me by my mistress' side
He's gone but his wife's killed
He is a notorious villain
I'll go after that same villain Because he is a damned slave
I am not valiant either But every puny man with a whip gets my sword
But why should honor outlive honesty
Let it all go
What did your song predict lady
Listen can you hear me
I will play the swan And die in music
Sings
Moor she was chaste she loved you cruel Moor So my soul goes to heaven because I tell the truth So speaking as I think I die I die
Uncle I must come out
You have no weapon and must be forced to suffer
Look in on me then and speak with me Or naked as I am I will attack you
What’s the matter
Behold I have a weapon A better one never sustained itself On a soldier's thigh
I have seen the day That I have made my way through more impediments With this little arm and this good sword Than you could stop twenty times
But O vain boast
Who can control his fate
It is not so now
Don’t be afraid although you see me armed Here is my journey's end here is my bottom And very sea mark of my last ship
Do you go back dismayed
It is a lost fear Man can only rush against Othello's breast And he retires
Where should Othello go
Now how do you look now
O ill starred wench
Pale as your smock
When we shall meet at elegance This look of yours will hurl my soul from heaven And devil will scratch at it
O cursed cursed slave
Whip me you devils From the possession of this heavenly sight
Blow me about in winds
Roast me in fires of sulphur
Wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire
O Desdemon
dead Desdemon
dead
Where is this impatient and very unfortunate man
Where is that snake
Bring the villain out
I look down towards his feet but that's a fable
If you are a devil I cannot kill you
Grab his sword from him
I bleed sir but I am not killed
I am not sorry either
I'd have you live Because in my thinking it is happiness to die
O you Othello that was once so good Fallen in the plan of a damned slave What shall be said to you
Why anything An honorable murderer if you will Because nothing I did was in hate but done all in honor
This wretch has part confessed his villainy
Did you and he agree to Cassio's death
Yes
Dear general I never gave you any reason
I do believe it and I ask your pardon
Will you I beg you demand that demi devil To tell why he has trapped my soul and body like this
From this time forward I’ll never speak word
What not even to pray
Torture will open your lips
Well you do what’s best
Sir you shall understand what has happened Which as I think you don’t know
Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the murdered Roderigo And here another
One of them shows that The death of Cassio was to be undertaken By Roderigo
O villain
Very heathenish and very gross
Now here's another unhappy document Found in his pocket too and this it seems That Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain But that very likely Iago in the meantime Came in and satisfied him
O the pernicious wretch
Cassio how did you come by that handkerchief That was my wife's
I found it in my bedroom And he himself confessed just now That he dropped it there for a special purpose Which would be bent to his desires
O fool
fool
fool
For this slave If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him a lot and stop him a long time It shall be his
You shall remain a prisoner Until the nature of your crime is known To the Venetian state
Come bring him away
Pardon me a word or two before you go
I have done the state some service and they know it
No more of that
I beg you in your letters When you shall tell about these unlucky deeds Speak of me as I am nothing farfetched And don’t write anything in malice
Then you must speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well Of one not easily jealous but being aggravated Confused in the extreme of one whose hand Like the low Judas threw a pearl away That was richer than all his tribe of one whose sad eyes Albeit unused to a crying spell Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees drop Their medicinal gum
Write this down And say besides that in Aleppo once Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk Beat a Venetian and double crossed the state I took the circumcised dog by the throat And killed him like this
O bloody period
All that's spoken is marred
I kissed you before I killed you
No way but this Killing myself to die on a kiss
I was afraid of this but I thought he had no weapon He was great of heart
O Spartan dog More evil than anguish hunger or the sea
Look on the tragic load on this bed This is your work
The object of poison’s sight Let it be hidden
Gratiano keep the house And seize on the fortunes of the Moor Because they fall on you
I myself will board the ship right away and go to the state To relate his heavy act with heavy heart
Now old desire lies in his deathbed And young affection is longing to be his heir That beauty for which love groaned and would die With tender Juliet matched now isn’t beautiful
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again Both of them bewitched by the charm of looks But he must complain to his supposed enemy And she must steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks
Gregory on my word we will not be humiliated like carrying coal
No for that we should be coal miners
I mean if we are angry we will draw our swords
Yeah while you’re alive you’ll only draw your neck out of the hangman’s collar
I can hit quickly if I’m motivated
But you’re not quickly motivated to hit
A dog of the house of Montague motivates me
Makes no difference
I will cut off their heads
Yes the heads of maids or their virginity
Take it any way you like
It’s a good thing you’re not a fish
It’s out already
How
By running away
Don’t worry about me
Yeah right
Let’s do this legally
Let them start with us
Let them take it whatever way they will
Did you just give us the finger sir
I did give the finger sir
Did you give the finger to us sir
No sir I did not give the finger to you sir but I did give the finger
Are you picking a fight with us sir
Fight sir
No sir
But if you do fight sir then I will fight you
I work for as good a man as you do
No better
Well sir
Say “better” Here comes one of Capulet’s relatives
Yes better sir
You’re a liar
You don’t know what you’re doing
What is your sword out among these stupid servants
I’m only trying to keep the peace
Put your sword away or use it to help me break up this fight
Fight me coward
Clubs pikes and more pikes
Strike
Beat them down
Down with the Capulets
Down with the Montagues
What’s going on
Give me my long sword hey
You need a crutch a crutch
Why do you want a sword
My sword I say
Old Montague is out there and waves his blade in spite of me
to his wife) Don’t hold me back – Let me go
You will not move one foot to fight
Rebellious subjects enemies to peace
Three civil brawls started by a meaningless comment By you old Capulet and you Montague Have three times disturbed the quiet of our streets And made Verona’s senior citizens Take out sober mementos of war and fighting To use them again as weapons in their old hands Rusted from not being used as hate has rusted your families
If ever you disturb our streets again You will suffer the death penalty for breaking the peace
Once more on pain of death all men depart
Who started it this time
Speak nephew where you there when it started
The servants of Capulet And your servants were fighting before I got there
O where is Romeo
Have you seen him today
I am very happy he wasn’t at this fight
I thought he was feeling the way I was That many people are at their busiest when they’re alone Kept on walking and thinking not worrying about him And I gladly walked away from him who gladly fled from me
My noble uncle do you know the cause
I don’t know and he won’t tell me
Have you questioned him at all
Both myself and many other friend But he advisor to his own affections Keeps it all to himself – I will not say how true But to himself so secret and so close So far from sounding and discovery Just like a flower bud bit by a worm jealous of its beauty Before her can bloom and spread his sweet leaves to the air Or dedicate his beauty to the sun
I wish you were happy to stay And hear his true confession
Come madam let’s leave
Good morning cousin Is it morning
It’s 9 AM
Dear me
sad hours seem long
Was that my father that went away so fast
It was
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours
Not having the thing that would make them short hours
In love
Out Of love
On the outs with the girl I love
Alas that love so gentle in his promise Should be so tyrannous and rough in reality
Alas that love whose eyes are blindfolded Should without eyes see ways to have his will done
Where should we eat
Oh me
What fight was here
Never mind don’t tell me for I have heard it all
O loving hate
O anything of nothing first create
O heavy lightness
serious vanity
Mis shapen disorder of perfectly pleasing forms
Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
This love feel I makes me feel no love in this
Why don’t you laugh
No cousin I'd rather cry
Good heart at what
At your good heart's oppression
Why that is love's transgression
My own griefs lie heavy in my heart Which you will take over to have it paired With more grief of your own
this love that you have shown Adds more grief to mine which is already too much
Love is like smoke rising with clouds of sighs Being cleansed a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes Being vexed a sea nourished with lovers' tears
What else is it
a madness most discreet A choking acid and a preserving sweet
Farewell my coz
Hold on
I’ll go along
If you leave me so depressed you do me wrong
Tut
Tell me in sadness who is that you love
What shall I groan and tell you
Groan
why no But sadly tell me who
In sadness cousin I do love a woman
I thought so when I supposed you were in love
A right good marksman
And she's fair who I love
A right fair mark fair coz is the first hit
Well in that hit you miss
She will not put up with loving language Nor tolerate loving looks Nor does she care if a guy is rich
O she's rich in beauty only poor That when she dies her beauty dies with her
Then she has sworn to remain a virgin
She has and in that decision is wasting her looks and charms For beauty starved with this woman’s severity Cuts beauty off from all posterity
She is too fair too wise wisely too fair To earn her own happiness by making me despair
She has sworn not to love and in that vow I am really dead as I stand here alive to tell you about it now
Listen to me forget about her
O teach me how I should forget to think
That way is To call her beauty which is exquisite more into question
Show me a mistress that is passing fair What purpose does her beauty serve but as a reminder That I may see some other woman who cannot pass her beauty
Farewell
thou canst not teach me to forget
I'll prove you wrong or else die trying
But Montague is the same restrictions as I am The same penalty and it should not be hard I think For men so old as we to keep the peace
Of honorable status are you both And it’s a pity that you lived at odds so long
But now my lord what say you to my request
Younger girls than she are made happy mothers
And too soon marred are those made young mothers
The earth has swallowed all my hopes but she She is the last hope I have
But woo her gentle Paris get her love
This night I hold an old feast that I’ve always given To which I have invited many guests People I love and if you will be among the guests You’ll be one more most welcome and will make my guests more
At my poor house look to behold this night Women like earth treading stars that make dark heaven light
They give such comfort as lusty young men feel When Spring appears with all the flowers and warmth After a long cold winter even such delight Among fresh female flower buds shall you this night Find at my house hear all all see And like her most whose worth shall be the most
Which among the many women my daughter being one May stand out though in my eyes none can match her
Come go with me
It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his measuring tape and the tailor with his shoe form the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets but I am sent to find the people whose names are written here and I cannot read what names the writing person has written here
I must find a reader
in good time
Take some new infection to your eye And the rank poison of the old love will die
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that
For what please tell me
For your broken shin
Why Romeo are you crazy
Not crazy but more tied up than a madman is I am shut up in prison kept without my food Whipped and tormented and  Good day good fellow
Good day Please tell me sir can you read
Yes my own fortune in my misery
Perhaps you have learned it without book
but please can you read anything you see
Yes If I know the letters and the language
You speak honestly
have a nice day
Stay fellow I can read
Where should they come
Up
Where
To supper to our house
Whose house
My master's
Indeed I should have asked you that before
Now I'll tell you without asking
my master is the great rich Capulet and if you are not of the house of Montagues please come and have a cup of wine
Have a nice day
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's The fair Rosaline whom you love so much will have supper With all the admired beauties of Verona
Let’s go and with a clear eye Compare her face with some others that I shall show you And I will make you think your swan is a crow
One fairer than my love
the all seeing sun Never saw anything to match her since the world first began
I'll go along not to be shown such a sight But to rejoice in splendor of my own love’s looks
Nurse where's my daughter
call her to come to me
Now by my virginity at twelve years old I told her to come
What lamb
what ladybird
God forbid
where's this girl
what Juliet
Your mother
Madam I am here
What is do you need
This is the matter Nurse leave us alone a while We must talk in secret
nurse come back again I have remembered you can hear our conversation
You know my daughter's at a pretty age
Believe me I can tell her age to the hour
She's not fourteen
I'll bet fourteen of my teeth And yet to tell the truth I’ve only got four She is not fourteen
How long is it now To the middle of July
Two weeks and a couple of days
Couple of days or not of all days in the year Come the middle of July she’ll be fourteen
My daughter Susan and she God rest all Christian souls
Were the same age
well Susan is with God She was too good for me
but as I said In the middle of July she’ll be fourteen That she will by Mary I remember it well
It’s been eleven years since the earthquake And she was weaned I never shall forget it  Of all the days of the year upon that day
No I do remember
He was a merry man took up the child
Look here“ he said “did you fall on your face
I swear if I should live a thousand yeas I never should forget it 'Won’t you Jule
Yes” said my husband ”you fell on your face
Peace I have done
God mark you for his grace
You were the prettiest baby that I ever nursed
If I live to see you married I have my wish
By Mary that “marry” is what I want to talk about
Tell me daughter Juliet What do you think about getting married
It is an honor that I never dreamed about
Well think of marriage now
younger than you Here in Verona ladies of esteem Are made already mothers
by my count I was your mother pretty close to the age That you are now
Thus then here it is The valiant Paris seeks you for his love
A man young lady
lady such a man As all the world why he's the very image of a wax statue
Verona's summer does not have such a flower of a man
No he's a flower I believe a very flower
What do you say
can you love the gentleman
The fish lives in the sea and it takes a lot of pride For beauty outside to hide without beauty inside
This book in many girls' eyes shares the glory That with gold clips locks in the golden story So you will share all that he possesses By having him you are doing no less than making yourself
No less
no bigger
Women grow by men
Speak briefly can you like Paris' love
I'll look at him to like him if just by looking I can like him But I will not go any further Than your consent gives my action strength to make it fly
Madam the guests are come supper served up you are called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in the pantry and everything is in chaos
We will follow you
Juliet the count is waiting
Go girl seek these happy nights to give you happy days
What are we going to give as our excuse
Or shall we just go on without any apology
The time is of such a boring duration
No gentle Romeo we must have you dance
Not me believe me
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles I have a soul of lead That pins me to the ground
I cannot move
You are a lover borrow Cupid's wings And use them to soar above that leaden soul
I am too sore from being pierced with Cupid’s shaft To soar with his wings and so wounded I cannot jump even a little bit above dull woe
Under love's heavy burden I would sink
And to sink in it you should outweigh love Too great oppression for a tender feeling
Is love a tender thing
it is too rough Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
Give me my mask
A fig for a mask
what do I care What curious eye lists my deformities
Here are the long black eyebrows that shall blush for me
Come knock and enter and as soon as we get in Every man start running
Just give me a torch
Let spoiled children light of heart Tickle the senseless weeds with their running and dancing For I am composing proverbs with a grandfather’s words I'll be a candle holder and look on The game was never any fun and I am done
Tut dun's the brownish color of a mouse the constable's own word
No that's not so
I mean sir in delaying our entrance We waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
Take our good meaning for our judgment sits Five times more in that sense than once in our five wits
And we mean well in going to this masquerade But it’s no great sport to go
Why may one ask
I dreamt a dream tonight
And so did I
Well what was yours
That dreamers often lie
In bed asleep while they do dream about things are true
O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
Sometime she drives over a soldier's neck And then he dreams of cutting foreign throats Of infractions  sneak attacks Spanish swords Of safety five fathoms deep in the sea and then soon He hears drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes And being thus frightened swears a prayer or two And sleeps again
This is that very Mab That braids the manes of horses in the night And bakes tangled messes of hair into foul dirty hairs Which once untangled signals the beginning of much misfortune
True I talk of dreams Which are the children of an idle brain Born of nothing but vain fantasy Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind who courts Even now the frozen heart of the north And being angered puffs away from there Turning his face to the dew dropping south
This wind you talk of blows us from our party crashing
Supper is done and we shall come too late
But God who has the plan of my journey on this sea Direct my sail
On lusty gentlemen
Strike the drum
Where's Potpan that he doesn’t help with cleaning up
Move the plates
Scrape the plates
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands and they unwashed too it’s a foul thing
Away with the good stools remove the china closet look to the plate
please save me a piece of marzipan and because you love me let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell
Yes boy ready
You are looked for and called for asked for and sought for in the great chamber
Welcome gentlemen
ladies whose toes are Not plagued with corns will have a dance with you
Ah ha my mistresses
which one of you all Will now deny to dance
She that makes dainty and shy she I'll swear has corns
Am I to come near you now
Welcome gentlemen
You are welcome gentlemen
Come musicians play
A hall a hall
Make room
Ah Servant this unlooked for sport comes well
By our Lady thirty years
What man
It’s since the wedding of Lucentio Come Pentecost as quickly as it will it’s Some five and twenty years since we masked
It’s more it’s more
his son is older sir His son is thirty
Will you tell me that
His son was but a ward two years ago
What lady is that who make the hand Of that knight richer
I know not sir
O she teaches the torches to burn bright
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night Like a rich jewel in an Ethiopian’s ear Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
So a snowy dove trooping with crows shows As yonder lady over her fellows shows
The dance done I'll watch to see where she’ll stand And touching her hand will make blessed my rude hand
Did my heart love till now
Renounce it sight
For I never saw true beauty till this night
This by his voice should be a Montague
Fetch me my rapier boy
what dares the slave Come hither covered with a mask To sneer and scorn at our feast
Now by the stock and honor of my kin I don’t think it’s a sin to strike him dead
Why what kinsman
Why do you storm so
Uncle this is a Montague our foe A villain that has come here in spite To scorn at our feast this night
Young Romeo is it
It is he that villain Romeo
Be content gentle cousin leave him alone
He bears himself like a portly gentleman And to say truth Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well governed youth
I would not for the wealth of all the town Do him disrespect here in my house
Therefore be patient take no note of him It is my will
If you respect my will then Show a fair presence and put off these frowns They are not the proper expressions for a feast
It fits when such a villain is a guest
What good lord boy
Am I the master here or you
Come on
You'll not endure him
You will be boastful
You'll be the man
Why uncle it’s a shame
Come on come on
You are a saucy boy
Is it so indeed
You must contradict me
I'll make you quiet
Patience perhaps meeting with a willful temper Makes my flesh tremble in their differences
I will withdraw but this intrusion shall Now seeming sweet convert to bitter acid
If I desecrate with my most unworthy hand This holy shrine of your hand the gentle end is this My lips like two blushing pilgrims ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
Good pilgrim you wrong your hand too much Which is showing devotion and good manners in this touch For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands touch And putting a palm to another palm is a holy pilgrim's kiss
Don’t saints and holy pilgrims have lips too
Yes pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
Saints do not move though they do grant favors for prayers' sake
Then don’t move while I take my prayer's answer
Thus from my lips by your lips my sin is purged
Then do my lips have the sin that they have taken from yours
Sin from my lips
O sin sweetly encouraged
Give me my sin again
You kiss by the book
Madam your mother craves a word with you
Who is her mother
By Mary young man Her mother is the lady of the house
And a good lady and a wise and virtuous lady
Is she a Capulet
O dear account
Now I am in debt to my enemy
Let’s go we’re leaving our party crashing is done
Yes so I fear and my fears are more than they were
I can’t change your mind
More torches here
Come on then let's go to bed
Ah Servant [to 2 Capulet] by my faith it grows late I'm going to sleep
Come here nurse
Who is that gentleman over there
The son and heir of old Tiberio
Who is he that is going out the door now
By Mary that I think is young Petruchio
Who is he that follows there the one who wouldn’t dance
I don’t know
His name is Romeo and a Montague The only son of your great enemy
My only love sprung from my only hate
Seen too early as an unknown and now known too late
It is a monstrous birth of love to me That I must love a loathéd enemy
What's this
What's this
A rhyme I learned even now From someone I couldn’t dance with
Again again
Come let's go all the strangers are gone
The clock struck nine when I sent the nurse She promised to return in half an hour
Maybe she can’t meet him
that's not true
O she is lame
Love's heralds should be thoughts Which glide ten times faster than the sun's beams Driving back shadows over lowering hills
This way doves with nimble wings draw love And that’s why the wind swift Cupid has wings
Now is the sun upon the highest hill Of this day's journey and from nine till twelve Is three long hours yet she’s not back
O God she comes
O honey nurse what news
Have you met with him
Send your man away
Peter stay at the gate
Now good sweet nurse O Lord why do you look sad
What a jaunt I have had
I wish you had my bones and I had your news
Jesus what’s your hurry
Can’t you rest awhile
Don’t you see that I’m out of breath
How are you out of breath when you have breath To say to me that you are out of breath
The excuse that you make in this delay Is longer than the tale you excuse
Is your news good or bad
Answer that
Say either good or bad and I'll wait for the details
Let me be satisfied is it good or bad
Romeo
he is not the flower of courtesy but I'll guarantee that he is as gentle as a lamb
Go about your business wench serve God
What have you dined at home
What does he say about our marriage
What of that
Lord how my head aches
what a head I’ve got
It throbs as if it’s going to fall into twenty pieces
My back on the other side O my back my back
Curse your heart for sending me out To catch my death with prancing up and down
In faith I am sorry that you’re not well
Sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what does my love say
Your love says like an honest gentleman And a courteous and a kind and a handsome And I guarantee a virtuous gentleman Where is your mother
Where is my mother
why she’s inside
Where should she be
How oddly you reply
Your love says like an honest gentleman ”Where is your mother” O God's lady dear
Are you so hot
From this time forward do your messages yourself
Here's such a choice
come what does Romeo say
Have you got permission to go to confession today
I have
Then go quickly to Friar Lawrence' cell A husband waits there to make you a wife
Now comes the lusty blood up in your cheeks They'll be bright red instantly at any news
Go quickly to church I must go another way To fetch a ladder by the which your love Must climb to a bird's nest soon when it is dark
I am the slave and worker in your delight But you shall bear the burden soon at night
Go on I'll go to dinner go quickly to the cell
Go quickly to high fortune
honest nurse farewell
Can I go home when my heart is here
Turn back dull earth and find out where your center is
Romeo
He is wise And on my life he has stolen home to bed
He ran this way and leaped over this orchard wall
Call him good Mercutio
No I'll conjure him up too
Romeo
Humors
Madman
Passion
Lover
Appear in the likeness of a sigh
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied Cry but “Ah me” Pronounce but “love” and “dove” Speak one fair word to my godmother Venus One nickname for her almost blind son and heir Young auburn Cupid he that shot the arrow so well When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid
He doesn’t hear he doesn’t make noise he doesn’t move The fool is dead and I must conjure him up
If he hears you you will make him angry
This cannot anger him
It would anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle Of some strange nature letting it stand there Until she had laid it down and conjured it down
My invocation Is fair and honest and in his mistress' name I only conjure him to raise up him
Come he has hidden himself among these trees To have a sexual liaison with the moody night
His love is blind and it suits the dark best
If love is blind love can’t find the spot
Now he’ll sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone
Romeo good night
I'm going to my pull out bed This field bed is too cold for me to sleep in
Come on shall we go
Go then for it’s useless To look for him here when he intends not to be found
He laughs at the scars of love when he’s never felt love’s pain
Quiet
what light breaks through that window
It is the east and Juliet is the sun rising
Arise fair sun and kill the jealous moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That you her maid are far more beautiful than she is
Don’t be her maid since she is so jealous
Her chaste white gown is only sick and green And only fools wear it
Take it off and throw it away
It is my lady O it is my love
O I wish she knew that she was my love
She speaks but she says nothing
what does that mean
I am too bold she’s not speaking to me
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven Having some business do beg her eyes To twinkle in their sockets till the stars return
What if her eyes were there they in her head
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight shames a lamp her eyes in heaven Would stream so brightly through the skies That birds would sing and think it was morning
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
O I wish I were a glove on that hand So that I might touch that cheek
Ah me
She speaks
O speak again bright angel
for you are As glorious to this night that is over my head As is a wingéd messenger of heaven To the white upturned wondering eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he crosses the slow moving clouds And sails upon the heart of the wind
O Romeo Romeo
Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this
O be some other name
What's in a name
that which we call a rose Would smell as sweet if it had any other name
So Romeo if he wasn’t called “Romeo” would Retain that dear perfection which he has Without that title
Romeo throw your name away And for that name which isn’t part of you Take all of me
I take you at your word
Only call me “love” and I'll be baptized with a new name
From now on I’ll never be “Romeo” What man are you who wrapped in the cover of night Stumbles on my private thoughts
By a name that I don’t know how to tell you who I am
My name dear saint is hateful to me Because it is an enemy to you
If I had written it down on paper I would tear the word from the page
My ears haven’t yet heard a hundred words Of that tongue's speech and yet I know the sound Aren’t you Romeo and a Montague
How did you come here tell me and why
If they see you they will murder you
It’s a shame there is more danger in your eye Than twenty of their swords
if you will just look sweet Then I am protected against their hate
I wouldn’t have them see you here for the world
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight And if you love me let them find me here
My life were better ended by their hate Than death postponed wanting your love
Who gave you the directions to this place
I am no sea captain but if you were as far away As that vast shore washed with the furthest sea I would risk everything for such a cargo
You know that the night hides my face Otherwise a maiden’s blush would paint my cheek For what you overheard me say tonight
Gladly I would dwell on form gladly gladly deny What I have spoken but farewell polite words
Do you love me
I know you will say “Yes” And I will take your word
but if you swear You may prove false
At lovers' lies They say Jove laughs
O gentle Romeo If you do love pronounce it faithfully
I should have been more unfriendly I must confess But you overheard before I was aware of you My true love’s passion
Therefore pardon me And not attribute this surrender to light love Which the dark night has discovered
Lady by the blessed moon up there That tips with silver all these fruit tree tops I swear O don’t swear by the moon the inconstant moon That monthly goes through changes in her circled orbit For fear that your love prove as variable as the moon
What shall I swear by
Don’t swear at all Or if you will swear by your own gracious self Which is the god that I worship And I'll believe you
If my heart's dear love Well don’t swear
This bud of love ripen by summer's breezes May become a beautiful flower when next we meet
Good night good night
May sweet repose and rest Come to your heart such as that is within my breast
O will you leave me so unsatisfied
What satisfaction can you have tonight
The exchange of your love's faithful vow for mine
I gave you my vow before you asked for it And yet I wish I could give it again
Would you take it away
Why love
Only to be honest and give it to you again
And still I wish but for the thing that I already have
My treasure has no boundaries just like the sea My love is as deep as the sea the more I give to you The more I have for both my love and the sea are infinite
I hear some noise within
dear love goodbye
Right away good nurse
Sweet Montague be true
Stay here a minute
O blessed blessed night
I am afraid Standing in this night that all this is only a dream Too promising and sweet to be real
Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
If that your love is honorable Your intention marriage send me word tomorrow By one that I'll get to come to you Where and what time you will marry me And I’ll lay all my fortunes at your feet And follow you my lord throughout the world
Madam
But if you don’t mean well I beg you Madam
I’m coming To end your pursuit of me and leave me to my grief
I’ll send tomorrow
I’ll be waiting A thousand times good night
A thousand times the worse for me to want your light
Love goes toward love as schoolboy away from their books But love goes from love like boys towards school with heavy looks
Listen Romeo listen
O I wish I had a falconer's voice To lure this hawk back to me again
Being a slave has a hoarse voice and may not speak aloud Or else I would go to the cave where Echo lives And make her airy voice more hoarse than mine is With the repetition of my Romeo's name
It is my soul that calls my name
How silver sweet is the sound of lovers' voices by night Like softest music to listening ears
Romeo
My dear
What time tomorrow Should I send someone to you
At nine
I will not fail
It’s going feel like twenty years until then
I have forgotten why I called you back
Let me stand here until you remember
I shall forget just to have you stand there Remembering how I love your company
And I'll still stay to have you still forget Forgetting any other home but this one
I wish I were your bird
Sweet so do I
But I should kill you with much cherishing
Good night good night
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night until it’s tomorrow
Sleep dwell upon your eyes peace in your breast
I wish I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
I will go right away to my ghostly priest's house To get his help and to tell him about my dear good fortune
The grey eyed morning smiles on the frowning night Cutting the eastern clouds into squares with streaks of light And the flecked darkness reels like a drunkard From the day's path and the sun’s hot rays
No before the sun advances his burning eye To cheer the day and to dry night's dank dew I must fill up this our cage made of reeds With baleful weeds and precious juiced flowers
The earth that is nature's mother is nature’s tomb
The grave where she’s buried that is also her womb And from her womb we find children of diverse kinds When we are sucking on her natural bosom Many plants are excellent for many virtues Some have none others have some but are all different
Virtue itself can turn to vice if it is misapplied And vice is sometimes dignified by action
Two such opposed kings set up camp In man as well as in herbs grace and rude will And where the worse human trait is predominant The canker death eats up that plant very soon
Good morning father
Bless you
What early tongue so sweetly salutes me
Young son it is arguably a distempered head that Bids good morning so soon to your bed
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye And where care lodges sleep will never lie But where a perfect youth with an empty brain Rests his limbs golden sleep reigns there
Therefore your earliness assures me that You are aroused by some disturbance in your mind Or if that’s not it then I guess right Our Romeo has not been in bed tonight
That last part is true my rest was the sweeter
God pardon sin
Were you with Rosaline
With Rosaline my ghostly father
No
I have forgotten that name and that name's pain
I'll tell you before you ask me again
I have been feasting with my enemy Where all of a sudden one has wounded me That's by me also wounded
Holy Saint Francis
What a change this is
Is Rosaline who you did love so dearly So soon forsaken
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
How much salt water was thrown away in waste To season love that did not taste love
If ever you were yourself and these woes yours You and these woes were all for Rosaline
And are you changed
Pronounce this sentence then Women may fall when there's no strength in men
You often scolded me for loving Rosaline
For doting not for loving my pupil
And you told me bury love
Not in a grave To lay one in and take another out
Please don’t scold me
She whom I love now Has grace for grace and love for love allowed
The other one didn’t
But come young waverer come go with me
Wisely and slowly
They stumble that run fast
Where the devil can this Romeo be
Didn’t he come home tonight
Ah that same pale hard hearted wench that Rosaline Torments him so that he will sure run mad
Tybalt the kinsman to old Capulet Has sent a letter to his father's house
A challenge on my life
Romeo will answer it
Any man that can write may answer a letter
No he will answer the letter's writer how he dares being dared
Poor Romeo he is already dead
Why what is Tybalt
More than Prince of Cats I can tell you
O he's the courageous captain of compliments
He fights as you sing prick song keeps time distance and proportion rests his minimum rest
ah the immortal forward thrust
the back handed thrust
the hay
The what
The pox of such antic lisping affecting absurd and irrational people these new tuners of accents
By Jesus a very good blade
a very tall man
O their bones their bones
Without his fish eggs like a dried herring
O flesh flesh how are you fishified
Now he is for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in
There's a French salutation to your French slop
You gave us a good false impression last night
Good morning to you both
What false impression did I give you
That's as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bend his legs
Meaning to good manners
Thou hast most kindly hit it
A most courteous exposition
No I am the very small spot of courtesy
Pink for flower
Right
Why then my shoe is well flowered
Well said
Follow me in this joke now until you have worn out your shoe that when the single sole of it is worn the joke may remain after the wearing sole singular
O single soled joke only singular for the singleness
At full speed at full speed or I'll cry a match
No if your wits run the wild goose chase I’m done because you have more of the wild goose in one of your wits than I am sure I have in my whole five
Was I with you there for the goose
You were never with me for anything when you were not there for the goose
I will bite you on the ear for that joke
No good goose don’t bite
Your wit is a very bitter sweetness it is a most sharp sauce
And isn’t then well served with a sweet goose
O here's a wit of kid leather that stretches from an inch narrow to 45 inches wide
I stretch it out for that word “broad” which added to the goose proves you far and wide a broad goose
Why isn’t this better now than groaning for love
Now you’re sociable now you’re Romeo now you are what you are by art as well as by nature
for this idiotic love is like a great natural fool that runs lolling up and down to hide his toy in a hole
Stop there stop there
You want me to stop in my tale against the hair
Otherwise you would have made your tale large
Here's some good stuff
A sail a sail a sail
Peter
Right away
My fan Peter
Good Peter to hide her face for her fan has the fairer face
Good morning gentlemen
Good evening fair gentlewoman
Is it good evening
It’s no less I tell you for the bawdy hand of the clock is now upon the prick of noon
Shame on you
What kind of a man are you
One gentlewoman that God has made for himself to damage
Gentlemen can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo
I can tell you but “young” Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you asked for him
I am the youngest of that name for fault of a worse name
You say well
Yeah is the worst well
If you be he sir I desire some confidence with you
She will give him a written invitation to some supper
A hare a hare a hare
So ho
What have you found
An old gray hare And an old gray hare Is very good meat in Lent But a hare that is gray Is too much to be billed When it ages before it used up
Romeo will you come to your father's
We'll have dinner there
I will follow you
By Mary farewell
Please sir what rude salesman was this that was so full of his own trickery
A gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk and will speak more in a minute than you think should do for a month
If he speaks anything against me I'll take him down even if he were lustier than he is and twenty such Jacks and if I cannot I'll find those that shall
Scurvy knave
And you just stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure
I would draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side
Now before God I am so annoyed that every part about me quivers
Scurvy knave
Nurse commend me to your lady and mistress
I must protest your comments Good heart and in faith I will tell her as much
What will you tell her nurse
You don’t understand me
Bid her devise some means to come to confession This afternoon And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell Make her confession and married
Here is something for your pains
No truly sir not a penny
This afternoon sir
Well she’ll be there
And wait good nurse behind the abbey wall
Within this hour my man shall be with you And bring you a rope ladder Which must be my way to the highest point Of my joy in the secret night
Now God in heaven bless you
Listen sir
What did you say my dear nurse
Can your man keep a secret
Have you never heard the saying Two may keep counsel putting the other one away
I guarantee you my man is as true as steel
Well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady
Lord Lord
when she was a little chatterbox O there's a nobleman in town one Paris that would gladly like her attention but she good soul would rather see a toad a very toad than to see him
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the more proper man but I'll guarantee you when I say so she looks as pale as any linen in the whole wide world
Doesn’t “rosemary” and “Romeo” begin with the same letter
Yes nurse what of that
Both begin with an R Ah joker
That's the dog's name
Commend me to your lady
Yes a thousand times
Exit Romeo
Yes
Peter take my fan and go before me
So the heavens smile upon this holy act That after hours will not scold us with sorrow
Amen amen
but whatever sorrow can come It cannot equal the exchange of joy That one short minute in her sight gives me
You only have to close our hands with holy words Then love devouring death can do whatever he dares It is enough that I may call her mine
These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die like fire and powder Which as they kiss consume each other
The sweetest honey Is loathsome in its own deliciousness And in the taste destroys the appetite
Here comes the lady
O so light a foot Will never wear out the everlasting sharpening stone
Good evening to my ghostly confessor
Romeo shall thank you daughter for us both
As much to him otherwise his thanks is too much
Ah Juliet if the amount of your joy Is heaped up like mine and that your sense of right be more To adorn it with then sweeten this neighboring air With your breath and let rich music's language Reveal the imagined happiness that we both Receive in this dear meeting
Come come with me and we will be quick Because by your permission you shall not stay alone Until holy church incorporates the two of you into one
Please good Mercutio let's go home
You are like one of these fellows that when he enters the bar throws his sword upon the table and says ”God I don’t want to use you” and by the time he’s drunk the second cup draws the sword on the table when indeed there is no need
Am I like such a fellow
Come on you are as hot as any fellow in your mood as anyone else in Italy and you are soon moved to be moody and soon moody to be moved
And to what
No if there were two such fellows we should have none shortly because one would kill the other
You
Why you will quarrel with a man that has a hair more or a hair less in his beard than you have
Your head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat and your head has even been beaten like a rotten egg for quarrelling
You have quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he woke up your dog that was asleep in the sun
And yet you will teach me to avoid quarrelling
If I were so easy to quarrel as you are any man should buy the inherited estate of my life for an hour and a quarter
The inherited estate
O how honest
By my head here come the Capulets
By my heel I care not
Follow me close because I will speak to them
Only one word with one of us
Couple it with something make it a word and a blow
You shall find me easy enough for that sir if you will give me the opportunity
Couldn’t you take some opportunity without my giving you one
Mercutio you hang out with Romeo Hang out
what do you make us musicians
If you make us musicians look to hear nothing but noise
We’re talking here in a public place
Well peace be with you sir
Here comes my man
But I'll be hanged sir if he will put up with your insults
By Mary go before him to field he'll be your follower
Your honor in that sense may call him a man
Tybalt the reason that I have to love you Does excuse very much the rage that is appropriate For such a greeting
I am not a villain
Therefore farewell
I see that you don’t know me
Boy this walking away shall not excuse the injuries That you have done to me therefore turn and draw your sword
O calm dishonorable vile submission
To choke carries it away
Tybalt you rat catcher will you walk away
What would you have with me
Will you pluck your sword out of its holder by the handle
Hurry up for fear my sword will be about your ears before you get yours out
I am for you
Gentle Mercutio put up your sword
Come sir your forward thrust
Gentlemen for shame
control this anger
Tybalt Mercutio the prince has expressly Forbidden this fighting in Verona streets
Hold Tybalt
Good Mercutio
I am finished
Is he gone and he has nothing
What are you hurt
Where is my page
Go villain get a doctor
No it’s not as deep as a well or as wide as a church door but it’s enough it will do
Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man
I am not long I guarantee for this world
A plague on both your houses
A dog a rat a mouse a cat to scratch a man to death
a braggart a rogue a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic
to Romeo] Why the devil did you come between us
I was hurt under your arm
I thought it was all for the best
Help me into some house Benvolio Or I shall faint
A plague on both your houses
They have made meat for the worms out meat of me
I have had it and soundly too
Your houses
That gallant spirit has gone into the clouds Which saw an untimely death here on earth
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again
Gentleness go away to heaven And fire eyed fury be my guide now
Now Tybalt take back again the word “villain” That you just gave me for Mercutio's soul Is only a little way above our heads Waiting for yours to keep him company
Either you or I or both of us must go with him
You wretched boy that hung out with him here Will be with him there
This fight shall determine that
Romeo leave be gone
The citizens are up and Tybalt is dead
Don’t stand there in shock
The prince will sentence you to death If you are taken prisoner
Get going get out of here leave
O I am fool for the goddess of luck
Why do you stay
Which way did he who killed Mercutio run
Tybalt that murderer which way did he run
There lies that same Tybalt
Where are the wicked beginners of this fight
There lies the man slain by young Romeo That killed your kinsman brave Mercutio
Tybalt my cousin
O my brother's child
O prince
O husband
O the blood of my dear kinsman is spilled
Prince as you are true For blood of ours shed blood of Montague
O cousin cousin
Benvolio who began this bloody fight
Tybalt here killed who was slain by Romeo’s hand
Romeo spoke nicely to him asked him to consider How silly the quarrel was and in addition advised him of Your high displeasure
Romeo cries aloud ”Stop friends
This is the truth or let Benvolio die
Some twenty of them fought in this black fight And all those twenty could only take one life
I beg for justice which you prince must give Romeo killed Tybalt
Romeo must not live
Romeo killed him he killed Mercutio
Who now owes the price of his dear blood
Not Romeo prince he was Mercutio's friend His mistake finishes only what the law should end The life of Tybalt
And for that offence We immediately exile him from here
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding My blood for your rude brawls lies there bleeding But I'll punish you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent my loss
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses Nor shall tears or prayers buy your way out
Therefore use none
Let Romeo go quickly away from here Or else when he is found that hour is his last
Bear this body away and wait for our instructions
Mercy only murders us pardoning those that kill
Gallop quickly you horses with fiery flames for feet Towards the Sun god’s house
Such a wagon driver As Phaeton (the son of the Sun god) would whip you to the west And bring in a cloudy night immediately
Close your curtain love performing night so That rude eyes may look away and Romeo can Leap to these arms un talked about and unseen
Come civil night You sober suited matron all in black And teach me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidens
Conceal my virgin blood fluttering in my cheeks With your black mantle until unknown love grown bold Thinks that true love is an act of simple modesty
Come gentle night come loving black browed night Give me my Romeo and when he shall die Take him and cut him out in little stars And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the glaring sun
O I have bought the mansion of a love But I have not moved in and though I am sold I have not yet been enjoyed
So boring this day is As the night before some festival is To an impatient child that has new clothes And can’t wear them
What have you got there
The ropes That Romeo asked you to fetch
Yes yes the ropes
Ah me
What news
Why are you wringing your hands
Ah alas
he's dead he's dead he's dead
We are ruined lady we are ruined
Shame on this day
he's gone he's killed he's dead
Can heaven be so jealous
Romeo can Though heaven cannot
O Romeo Romeo
Who ever would have thought it
Romeo
What devil are you that torments me like this
This torture should make a loud noise in dismal hell
Has Romeo killed himself
You say only “I” And I shall poison that bare vowel more Than the death darting eye of the serpent hatched from an egg
I am not “I” if there be such an “I” Or those eyes shut that make you answer “I” If he is slain say “I” or if not say “No” Brief sounds determine my wealth or sorrows
here on his manly breast
O break my heart
poor bankrupt break at once
Evil earth die end all motion here And you and Romeo lay in a heavy tomb
O courteous Tybalt
What kind of storm is this that blows so opposed to nature
Is Romeo slaughtered and is Tybalt dead
My dear loved cousin and my dearer lord
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
For who is living if those two are gone
Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished Romeo killed him he is banished
O God
did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood
O serpent heart hidden by a handsome face
Did a dragon ever keep so beautiful a cave
Beautiful tyrant
Fiend angelical
Dove feathered raven
Wolfish rabid lamb
Despised substance of the most divine show
Just opposite to what you justly seem A damned saint an honorable villain
O nature what did you have to do in hell When you sheltered the spirit of a fiend In a deadly paradise of such sweet flesh
Was there ever a book containing such vile matter So beautifully bound
O that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace
There's no trust No faith no honesty in men all are liars All swear falsely all nothing all deceivers
Ah where's my man
Give me some whiskey
These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
Shame come to Romeo
Your tongue should be blistered For such a wish
He was not born to shame
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit For it’s a throne where honor may be crowned The only king of the universal earth
O what a beast was I to scold him
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband
Ah poor my lord what tongue shall clear your name When I your wife for three hours have mangled it
But why villain did you kill my cousin
That villain cousin would have killed my husband
Back foolish tears back to your native spring
Your drops of tribute belong to sorrow Which you mistaken have offered up to joy
My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain And Tybalt's dead that would have slain my husband
Some word there was worse than Tybalt's death That murdered me
I would gladly forget it But O it presses into my memory Like damned guilty deeds press into sinners' minds
Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished” That “banished” that one word “banished” Has killed ten thousand Tybalts
But with a rear ward following Tybalt's death ”Romeo is banished” To speak that word Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet All slain all dead
Where are my father and my mother nurse
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corpse
Will you go to them
I will bring you there
They wash his wounds with tears
My tears shall be spent When theirs are dry for Romeo's banishment
Take up those ropes
Poor ropes you are deceived Both you and I for Romeo is exiled
He made you to be a highway to my bed But I a maid die a maiden and a widow
Hurry to your chamber
I'll find Romeo To comfort you
I know well where he is
You listen your Romeo will be here at night
I'll go to him he is hidden at Lawrence' cell
O find him
Give this ring to my true knight And bid him come to take his last farewell
Romeo come here come here you fearful man
Affliction is in love of your parts And you are married to calamity
Father what news
What is the prince's sentence
What sorrow craves to know me at my hand That I don’t know yet
My dear son is Too familiar with such sour company
I bring you news of the prince's sentence
What less than the end of the world is the prince's sentence
A gentler judgment vanished from his lips Not your body's death but your body's banishment
What banishment
be merciful say death For exile has more terror in his look Much more than death do not say banishment
You are banished away from Verona
Be patient for the world is broad and wide
There is no world without Verona walls Only purgatory torture hell itself
Calling death banishment You cut my head off with a golden axe And smile on the stroke that murders me
O deadly sin
O rude unthankfulness
Your fault our law calls death but the kind prince Taking your part has brushed aside the law And turned that black word “death” to banishment
This is dear mercy and you don’t see it
It’s torture and not mercy
Heaven is here Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog And little mouse every unworthy thing Live here in heaven and may look on her But Romeo may not
More legal authority More honorable state more courtship lives In flies on dead meat than Romeo
Flies may do this when I must fly from this
And you still say that exile is not death
O you will speak again of banishment
Again “banished” Stop with the philosophy
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet Uproot a town reverse a prince's sentence It doesn’t help it doesn’t succeed
Talk no more
O then I see that madmen have no ears
How should they when wise men have no eyes
Let me argue with you about your situation
You can’t speak about something you don’t feel
If you were as young as I Juliet your love Married only an hour Tybalt murdered Foolish like me and like me banished Then you might speak then you might tear your hair And fall upon the ground as I do now Thinking about an unmade grave
Good Romeo hide yourself
Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans Like a mist wraps me up and hides me from the search of eyes
Listen how they knock
Who's there
Who knocks so hard
Where do you come from
What do you want
Welcome then
There on the ground made drunk with his own tears
O it’s the same in my mistress' case Just in her case
O sad sympathy
Pitiful situation
She lies the same way Blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
Ah sir
ah sir
Well death's the end of us all
Did you speak of Juliet
How is it with her
Doesn’t she think I’m an old murderer Now I have stained the beginning of our joy With blood from a close relative
Where is she
And how is she doing
And what says My hidden lady to our canceled love
O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps And now falls on her bed and then starts up And calls Tybalt and then cries over Romeo And then falls down again
As if that name of Romeo Shot from the deadly level of a gun Murdered her the same way as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman
O tell me friar tell me In what vile part of this anatomy Does my name live
Tell me that I may rip The hateful mansion apart
Hold your desperate hand
Are you a man
Or ill beseeming beast in seeming both
You have amazed me
by my holy order I thought your disposition was of a better temper
Have you killed Tybalt
Will you kill yourself
And kill your lady too who lives in you By doing damned hate to yourself
Why do you complain about your birth the heaven and earth
Since birth is heaven and heaven is earth all three meet In you at once which you would lose at once
Your noble shape is only a form of wax Deviating from the valor of a man Your dear love sworn is empty lies Killing that love which you have vowed to cherish Your wit that ornament to shape and love Disfigured in the conduct of them both Like powder in a recruit soldier's flask Is set a fire by your own ignorance And you dismembered by your own defense
What wake up man
Tybalt would have killed you But you killed Tybalt
There you are lucky too
The law that threatened you with death becomes your friend And turns it into exile
There you are lucky
Pay attention pay attention for such people die miserable
Go go to your love as was decreed Ascend to her chamber there and comfort her
But be careful that you don’t stay after the guards are in place Because then you cannot get to Mantua Where you shall live until we can find a time To publicize your marriage reconcile your friends Beg pardon of the prince and call you back With twenty hundred thousand times more joy Than you left here in grief
Go before nurse
Commend me to thy lady And bid her to hurry the whole house to bed Which heavy sorrow makes them more likely to do
Romeo is coming
O Lord I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel
O what a great thing learning is
My lord I'll tell my lady you will come
Do so and bid my sweet to prepare to scold me
Here sir is a ring she asked me give you sir
Hurry up make haste for it grows very late
How well my comfort is revived by this
Travel to Mantua
I'll contact your man And he shall bring from time to time News to you of every good event that happens here
Give me your hand
It’s late
Only that a joy beyond joy calls out to me It’s a grief so brief to part with you
Farewell
Things have fallen out sir so unluckily That we have had no time to talk to our daughter
Listen she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly And so did I
Well we were born to die
I promise you except for your company I would have been in bed an hour ago
These times of sorrow don’t really give me a chance to pursue love
Madam good night
Commend me to your daughter
I will and I’ll know her mind early tomorrow Tonight she's shut up with her grief
Sir Paris I will make a desperate offer Of my child's love
I think she will be ruled By me in all respects no more I don’t doubt it
What day is this
Monday my lord
Monday
ha ha
Well Wednesday is too soon Make it Thursday
On Thursday tell her She shall be married to this noble earl
Will you be ready
Do you like this speed
We'll make it a small wedding a friend or two Because listen Tybalt’s being killed so recently People may think we didn’t care for him Being our relative if we party too much
So we'll have some half a dozen friends And that’ll be it
But what do say you to Thursday
My lord I wish that Thursday were tomorrow
Well go home
On Thursday it’ll be then
I swear that it is so very very late That we should call it early by and by
Good night
Are you going
It’s not morning yet
Believe me love it was the nightingale
It was the lark the messenger that says it’s morning No nightingale
Look love what jealous streaks of sunlight Lace the parting clouds over there in the east
Night's candles are burned out and the joyful day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
I have to go and live or stay and die
That light is not daylight I just know it
It is some meteor that the sun spits out To be a torch bearer for you tonight And light your way to Mantua
Therefore stay a bit longer you don’t need to go
I'll say that that gray streak is not the morning sun It’s only the pale reflection of Cynthia's brow And that’s not the lark whose notes hit The high ceiling of heaven so high above our heads
I have more care to stay than will to go
Come death and welcome
Juliet wills it so
How is it my soul
It is it is
It is the lark that sings so out of tune Straining to sing horrible songs and unpleasing notes
Some say the lark makes sweet division in its songs This isn’t true because she divides us
Lighter and lighter darker and darker our sorrows
Madam
Nurse
Your lady mother is coming to your bedroom
Then window let day in and let life out
Farewell farewell
Just give me one more kiss and I'll climb down
I must hear from you every hour of the day Because there are many days in just one minute
O by this count I’ll be very old Before I see my Romeo again
Farewell
I won’t miss a chance To send you my greetings love
O do you think we shall ever meet again
I don’t doubt it and all these sorrows shall Become sweet memories that we can talk about in our future
I think I see you now you are below me Looking like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb
Either my eyesight fails or you look pale
And trust me love in my eyes so do you
Thirsty sorrow drinks our blood
O Lady Luck
all men say you are changeable
If you are so fickle what do you want with a guy Who is known for his faith
Be changeable Luck Because then I hope you won’t keep him long But send him back to me
Hey daughter
Are you up
Who’s calling me
Is it my lady mother
Isn’t she down so late or up so early
What unusual reason brings her here
Why how are you Juliet
Madam I am not well
Endless weeping for your cousin's death
What will you wash him from his grave with tears
And if you could you couldn’t bring him back to life
Therefore stop grieving
A little grief shows much love But too much of grief shows a little craziness
Let me weep for feeling such a loss
You’ll feel the loss but not the loss of the friend You weep for
Feeling the loss so much I can’t help but weep for the friend forever
Well girl you are weeping not so much for his death As for the villain who lives who slaughtered him
What villain madam
That same villain Romeo
The words “Villain” and his name are many miles apart
God pardon him
I pardon him with all my heart And yet no man like him makes my heart so sad
That is because the traitor murderer lives
Yes madam from the reach of my hands
I wish that no one but me might avenge my cousin's death
We will have vengeance for it don’t worry about that
So stop crying
I'll send a messenger to someone in Mantua Where that same banished runaway lives And he shall give him such an unusual vial of medicine That he will soon keep Tybalt company And then I hope you’ll be satisfied
Indeed I’ll never be satisfied With Romeo till I see him dead
My poor heart is so aggravated for a kinsman Madam that if you could only find a man To bear a poison I would help to mix it So that Romeo should when he gets it Soon sleep in quiet
O how my heart hates To hear his name and I can’t present myself to him To vent the love I had for my cousin Tybalt Upon the body of the man that has slaughtered him
You find the means and I'll find such a man
But now I have joyful new for you girl
And joy is welcomed in such a needy time
What is it I beg your ladyship
Well well you have a careful father child One who to put you past all this grief Has sorted out a surprise happy day That you hadn’t expected and I hadn’t looked for
By Mary my child early next Thursday morning The gallant young and noble gentleman The Count Paris at St Peter's Church Shall happily make you there a joyful bride
This is news indeed
Here comes your father
Tell him so yourself And see how he will take it from you
When the sun sets the air drizzles dew But for the funeral of my brother's son It pours rain
What’s going on
Still a fountain girl
What still in tears
Forever showering
What’s going on wife
Have you told her what we have decided for her
I wish the foolish girl were married to her grave
What
Catch me catch me wife
Isn’t she proud
Doesn’t she count her blessings that Unworthy as she is we have secured So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
I’m not proud that you have but I’m thankful that you have
I can never be proud of what I hate But I can be thankful even for hate that is meant to be love
So that’s how it is now arguing with choppy reasoning
What is this
Get out you green diseased dead meat
Out you bag of garbage
You pale ugly face
For shame for shame
What are you crazy
I’ll see you hang first young filth
Disobedient wretch
Get yourself to church on Thursday Or never after that look me in the face
Don’t speak don’t reply don’t answer me
My fingers itch
Wife we were just thinking ourselves blessed That God had given us this only child But now I see that this one is one too many And that we are cursed in having her
Throw her out the good for nothing
God in heaven bless her
You are to blame my lord to berate her like this
And why are you butting in my lady wisdom
I’m not telling a lie
Can’t someone speak
Peace you mumbling fool
Talk about your serious speech over a gossip's bowl Because we don’t need it here
You are too hot under the collar
God's bread
It makes me angry
Eat where you can you won’t live with me
If you are mine I'll give you to my friend If you aren’t go hang yourself beg starve die in the streets Because by my soul I'll never acknowledge you exist And you will cut off from your inheritance
Trust to it
Think about it
You won’t make a liar out of me
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds That sees into the bottom of my grief
O sweet my mother don’t push me away
Delay this marriage for a month a week Or if you don’t make my bridal bed In that dim tomb where Tybalt lies
Don’t talk to me because I won’t answer you
Do what you want to do because I’m finished with you
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
How can I avoid committing a sin Unless the husband that heaven sent me Dies
What a pity what a pity that heaven should practice its strategies On a weak subject such as I am
What do you say
Don’t you have any word of joy
Give me some comfort nurse
Well then here it is
Romeo Is banished and all the world is nothing If he ever dares to come back to fight for you
Then since that’s the story as it stands now I think it best for you to marry the count
O he's a lovely gentleman
Romeo's a dish cloth compared to him
An eagle madam Is not as green as quick and hasn’t so beautiful an eye As Paris has
Curse my very heart I think you will be happy in this second marriage For it surpasses your first
Do you say this from heart
And from my soul too Or else curse them both
Amen
What
Well you have really comforted me a lot
Go inside and tell my mother that I’m going to Lawrence' cell to make confession and be forgiven Because I’ve made my father so angry
By Mary I will
Damn damn
O most wicked evil woman
Is it more sin to wish me to be a liar Or to curse my husband with the same tongue That she has praised him with above compare So many thousand times
I'll go to the friar to know his solution
If there isn’t a solution I have the power to kill myself
On Thursday sir
That’s very soon
My father Capulet wants it that way And I won’t do anything to stop him from being so hasty
You say you don’t know what the lady thinks about this
That’s not good I don’t like it
She weeps excessively about Tybalt's death And because of that I haven’t talked a lot about love Because the goddess of love doesn’t smile in a house of tears
Now sir her father thinks it’s dangerous That she gives in so much to her grief And in his wisdom hurries our marriage To stop the flood of her tears Which if she does too much crying by herself May make her too depressed to function in society
Now you know why we’re in a hurry
I wish I knew a reason this wedding should be slowed down
Look sir here the lady is coming toward my cell
I’m happy to see you my lady and my wife
You may call me that sir when I may be a wife
That “may be” must be love on next Thursday
Have you come to make confession to this father
To answer that question I should confess to you
Don’t deny to him that you love me
I will confess to you that I love him
So will you confess I am sure that you love me
If I do so it will be more valuable Being spoken behind your back than to your face
Poor soul your face is very wet with tears
The tears have gotten a small victory by that My face was bad enough before my tears took their revenge
You insult your face more than the tears did with that comment
And what I spoke I spoke to my face
Your face is mine and you’ve lied about it
What you say may be true because my face is not mine
Are you busy now holy father Or shall I come to you at evening mass
I’m not busy now nervous daughter
My lord we must be alone now
God forbid that I should interrupt religion
Juliet I’ll wake you up early on Thursday early
Until then goodbye and keep this holy kiss
O shut the door
I hear that you must and nothing can prevent it Be married to this count on next Thursday
Don’t tell me friar that you heard about this Unless you can tell me how I can prevent it
If in your wisdom you can’t help me Only say that my solution is a wise one And right now with this knife I'll help solve it
Therefore from your many years of experience in these matters Give me some advice now or look Between my will to go the limit and me this bloody knife Shall play the umpire deciding the problem That your many years’ experience Could bring to an honorable resolution
Don’t take long to speak
I want to die If what you’re going to say is not a solution to this problem
Stop daughter
I do see a kind of hope Which requires a plan as desperate As that event we want to prevent
If rather than to marry Count Paris You have the strength of will to kill yourself Then is it likely you will try Something like death to chase this shame away Something that will cover you with death himself to escape from it
Stay then
Go home be merry and agree To marry Paris
Tomorrow is Wednesday
Now when the bridegroom comes in the morning To wake up from your bed there you are dead
And he and I Will watch you wake up and that very night Romeo take you there to Mantua
Give it to me
O don’t tell me about fear
Stop it
I'll send a friar to Mantua Quickly with my letters to Romeo
Love give me strength
And strength shall gives us help
Farewell dear father
Invite the many guests on this list
Servant go hire me twenty great cooks
No one will get food poisoning sir I'll watch to see if they lick their fingers
How can watch them
By Mary sir it’s a sick cook that cannot lick his own fingers
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers won’t come back with me
Go get going
We will not have enough food and drink for this feast
What did my daughter go to Friar Lawrence
Yes she really did
Well maybe he’ll do her some good
A spiteful self willed badly behaved child she is
See how she comes from confession with a happy face
Hello my headstrong daughter
Where have you been wandering
Where I have learned how to repent the sin Of my stubbornness and disobedience To you and your requests and I am commanded By holy Lawrence to fall flat on the floor here To beg your forgiveness
Forgive me I beg you
From this point forward I will always obey you
Send for the Count
Go tell him about this
I'll have this marriage done tomorrow morning
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell And gave him what proper love I might Not overstepping the bounds of modesty
Why I am glad
This is great
Stand up
This is as it should be
Let me see the Count
Yes by Mary go I tell you and have him come here
Now before God everyone in our whole city is much bound to This reverend holy friar
Nurse will you go with me to my closet And help me pick out the things You think I will need for tomorrow
No not until Thursday
There’s plenty of time
Go nurse go with her
We're going to church tomorrow
We are not going to have enough food
It’s almost night now
I will work it out And everything will be fine I guarantee you wife
You go to Juliet help her ready
What hey
Well I will walk myself over To Count Paris’ house to prepare him For tomorrow
My heart is wonderfully light Since this same wayward girl is so reformed
What are you busy hello
Do you need my help
No madam we have selected the necessary things that Are useful for our event tomorrow
So please leave me alone now And let the nurse sit up with you this night For I am sure you have your hands full In this so sudden business
Good night
Go to bed and rest because you need to rest
Farewell
God knows when we shall meet again
I have a faint cold fear that scares my veins And it almost freezes up the heat of life
I'll call them back again to comfort me Nurse
What is she going to do here
I must act my dreadful scene alone
Come vial
What if this mixture doesn’t work at all
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning
No No
This dagger shall forbid it
You lie there
What if it be a poison which the friar Has secretly given me to have me dead so that he shouldn’t be dishonored Because he married me to Romeo before Paris
I won’t entertain such a bad thought
What if when I am laid in the tomb I wake up before the time that Romeo Is supposed to come and get me
That’s a scary thought
The shouldn’t I smother in the vault Where there is no fresh air And I will die there strangled before my Romeo comes
O look
I think I see my cousin's ghost Looking for Romeo who pierced his body With a sword's point
Wait Tybalt wait
Romeo I’m coming
I drink this vial to you
Hold on take these keys and go get more spices nurse
They’re asking for dates and quinces in the pastry
Come on let’s get going
The second rooster has crowed The curfew bell has rung It’s three o'clock
Don’t worry about the cost
In faith you'll be sick tomorrow Because you stayed up all night supervising
No not a whit
Yeah you have been a real weasel in your time But I will watch you to keep you from staying up all night now
A jealous spy a jealous spy
Now fellow What's there
Things for the cook sir but I don’t know what
Hurry up hurry up
Servant go get drier logs
Call Peter he’ll show you where they are
I have a head sir that will find out where the logs are I don’t have to bother Peter
By the Mass well said a merry bastard ha
You shall be a “logger head” Good faith it’s morning
The Count will be here soon with music Because he said he would
I hear him nearby
Nurse
Wife
What hello
What nurse I say
I'll go and chat with Paris
Quickly hurry Hurry
Mistress
What mistress
Juliet
Fast asleep I guarantee her
Why lamb
why lady
For shame you lazy loafer
Why love I say
Madam
Sweetheart
Why Bride
What not a word
You get your money’s worth of sleep now
Sleep for a week because tonight I guarantee Count Paris has set up his rest so That you shall rest but little
God forgive me
I must wake her up
Madam madam madam
Yes let the count get you out of your bed
What you’re dressed
I must wake you up
Lady
Lady
Lady
For pity’s sake for pity’s sake
Help help
My lady's dead
O pitiful day that I was ever born
Some whiskey hello
My lord
My lady
What noise is here
O lamentable day
What’s the matter
Look look
O heavy day
O me O me
My child my only life
Wake up look up or I will die with you
Help help
Call help
For shame bring Juliet out her lord is here
She's dead deceased
She's dead pitiful day
Pitiful day she's dead she's dead she's dead
Ha
Let me see her
For mercy’s sake
Death lies on her like an untimely frost On the sweetest flower in all the fields
O lamentable day
O sorrowful time
Death that has taken her away to make me wail Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
Ready to go but never to return
O son the night before your wedding day Death has slept with your bride
She lies there Like the flower that she was her virginity taken by him
I will die And leave him my entire estate
Life living   Death has it all
I have long thought I would see this morning's face And does it give me such a sight as this
Cursed unhappy wretched hateful day
Most miserable hour that time ever saw In lasting work of his travels
But one poor one one poor and loving child But one thing to rejoice and take comfort in And cruel death has taken it from my sight
O woe
O woeful woeful woeful day
Most lamentable day most woeful day That ever ever I have seen
O day
O day
O day
O hateful day
A day as black as this has never been seen
O woeful day
O woeful day
Deceived divorced wronged spited slain
O love
O life
Not life but love in death
Despised distressed hated martyred killed
Uncomfortable time why do you come now To murder murder our solemnity
O child
O child
My soul and not my child
Dead you are dead
For pity my child is dead And with my child my joys are buried
Peace ho for shame
Confusion's cure doesn’t live In these confusions
Your part in her you could not keep from death But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
O in this kind of love you love your child so badly That you are going crazy seeing that she is well
Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary On this fair corpse and as the custom is In all her best array carry her to church Because although foolish nature bids us all to grieve Still nature's tears are sanity's happiness
Sir you go inside and madam go with him And go Sir Paris
Every one should prepare To follow this beautiful corpse to her grave
In faith we may put up our pipes and go home
Yeah by my truth the case may be amended
We’re not playing a merry tune
This is no time to play
You won’t play then
No
Then I’ll give it to you as payment
What will you give us
Then will I give you the serving creature
Then I will lay the serving creature's dagger on your head
I won’t any hooked instruments
I'll “re” you I'll “fa” you
Do you note me
If you “re” us and “fa” us you note us
Please put away your dagger and pull out your wit
Then I’ll attack you with my wit
I will beat you severely with an iron wit and put away my iron dagger
Answer me like men
By Mary sir because silver has a sweet sound
Pretty
What do you say Hugh Rebeck
I say “silver sound” because musicians makes sounds for silver
Pretty too
What do you say James Soundpost
Faith I don’t know what to say
O have mercy
You are the singer
I will say it for you
It is “music with her silver sound” because musicians have no gold for making sounds
Then music with her silver sound ”With speedy help gives relief from sorrow” What kind of an annoying knave is this guy
The hell with him Jack
Come we'll go in here wait for the mourners and stay for dinner
If I may trust what happens while I sleep My dreams predict some joyful news is coming
My heart is very light in my chest And all this day an unusually happy spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
I dreamed that my lady came and found me dead Strange dream that gives a dead man a second thought
And she breathed such life with her kisses on my lips That I was brought back to life and I was an emperor
Ah me
How sweet love is when it is yours When only love's shadows are so rich in joy
News from Verona
How are you Balthasar
Don’t you bring me letters from the friar
How is my lady doing
Is my father well
How fares my Juliet
I’ll ask that again For nothing can be wrong if she is well
Then she is well and nothing can be wrong
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb And her soul lives with the angels
I saw her burial in her relative's vault And the I rushed to tell you
O forgive me for bringing you this sad news Since you did leave it all up to me sir
Is it so
Then I defy you stars
You know where I live
Get me ink and paper And hire some horses
I will leave here tonight
I beg you sir have patience
You look pale and wild and these signs Some bad luck
You’re mistaken
Leave me and do as I ask you
Don’t you letters to me from the friar
No my good lord
No matter
Get going And hire those horses
I'll be with you right away
Well Juliet I’ll sleep with you tonight
Let's figure out how to do this
O mischief you are quick To enter into the thoughts of desperate men
I do remember a pharmacist And lives near here who I noticed was dressed in In tattered weeds with overwhelming eyebrows Choosing the simple life
He looked very thin As if sharp misery had worn him down to the bones And in his poor shop a turtle was hanging And a stuffed alligator and other skins Of ill shaped fishes and on his shelves he had A poverty stricken collection of empty boxes and Green earthen pots animal bladders and musty smelling seeds Remnants of leftover twine and old cakes of roses Were thinly scattered around to make up a display
Noting this poverty I said to myself ”If a man did need a poison now ”The sale of which is punished by death in Mantua ”Here lives a poor wretch would sell it to him” O this same thought only predicted my need And this same needy man must sell it to me
As I remember this should be the house
Being a holiday the beggar's shop is closed
What hello
Pharmacist
Who is calling so loudly
Come here man
Let me have A small vial of poison such quickly acting medicine That it will disperse itself throughout all the veins In order that the life weary taker may fall dead And that the body may suffocate As violently as speedy gunpowder Hurries a bullet from a gun barrel
I have such deadly drugs but Mantua's law Gives the death penalty to anybody who sells them
You are so naked and full of misery And you’re afraid to die
My poverty agrees to take it but not my will
I pay your poverty and not your will
Put this poison into any liquid you want And drink it all and if you had the strength Of twenty men it would kill you right away
I sell you poison you haven’t sold me any
Farewell
Buy food and put on some weight
Holy Franciscan friar
This is the voice of Friar John
Welcome from Mantua
What does Romeo say
Or if he wrote his mind give me his letter
Going to find a fellow brother One of our order to help me Visit the sick here in this city And finding him the searchers of the town Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious plague was Sealed up the doors and wouldn’t let us leave So that my speed to Mantua was delayed by that
The who took my letter to Romeo
I couldn’t deliver it so here it is again I couldn’t even get a messenger to bring it back to you They were so afraid of getting infected with the plague
Very bad luck
By my brotherhood The letter was not a social one but a message Of great importance and failing to deliver it May do a lot of damage
Brother I'll go and bring it to you
She will really curse me that Romeo Has had no news of these events But I will write to him again in Mantua And keep her at my cell until Romeo comes to get her Poor living corpse closed in a dead man's tomb
Give me your torch boy
Go away and stand over there
Then whistle to me As signal that you hear something approaching
Give me those flowers
Go do what I have told you
I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard but I will stay
I will keep saying the funeral prayers for you and I will come Every night to put flowers on your grave and weep
The boy gives the warning something is approaching
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight To disturb my funeral prayers and the rites of true love
What with a torch
Night hide me awhile
Give me that chisel edged pick and the iron wrench
Stop take this letter
First thing in the morning See that you deliver it to my lord and father
Why I’m going down into this tomb Is partly to see my lady's face But mostly to take a precious ring from her dead finger a ring that I must use In a very special errand
But if you return jealous and try to find out What I intend to do By heaven I will tear you limb from limb And scatter your limbs all over this hungry churchyard
The time and my intents are savage and wild So much ore fierce and more determined Than hungry tigers or the roaring sea
I’ll go sir and not trouble you
This way you show me friendship
You take that
Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
Just the same I'll hide close by
I fear his looks and I doubt his reasons
You hateful belly you womb of death Stuffed full with the dearest morsel of the earth I will force your rotten jaws to open And in spite I'll cram you fuller with more food
This man is that banished arrogant Montague That murdered my love's cousin by which grief It is supposed the beautiful creature died And he’s come here to desecrate The dead bodies
I will seize him
Stop your unholy work vile Montague
Can vengeance be pursued any further than death
Condemned villain I arrest you
Obey and go with me because you must die
I beg you youth Don’t put another sin on my head By urging me to fight
O go away
By heaven I love you better than I love myself Because I came here only armed against myself
Live and later you will say A madman's mercy made you run away
I defy your solemn appeal And I here arrest you as a felon
Will you still provoke me
Then I’ll get you boy
O lord they’re fighting
I’ll go call the guards
O I’m killed
If you are merciful Open the tomb lay me with Juliet
In faith I will
Let me see this face
Mercutio's relative noble Count Paris
What my man say when my soul was tossing and turning And I didn’t pay attention to him as we rode
I think He told me Paris was going to marry Juliet
Did he say it
Or did I dream it
Or I’m crazy to think it was so Hearing him talk of Juliet 
O give me your hand One written along with me in sour luck's book
O no a lantern slaughtered youth Because Juliet lies here and her beauty makes This tomb a party room full of light
Death you lie there buried by a dead man
How often when men are at the point of death Have they been happy
Which their keepers call A lightening before death
O how may I Call this a lightening
O my love
My wife
Death that has sucked the honey of your breath Has had no power yet on your beauty
You’re not conquered
Beauty's officer Is still red on your lips and in your cheeks And death's pale flag is not yet planted there
Tybalt do you lie there in your bloody sheet
O what other favor can I do for you Than to end the youth of your enemy with the same hand that cut your youth half
Forgive me cousin
Ah dear Juliet Why are you still so beautiful
Shall I believe That death that has no substance is a lover And that the lean ugly monster keeps You here in dark to be his mistress
Because I’m afraid of that I still will stay with you And never leave this palace of dim night Again
Here here I will remain With the worms that are your maids
O here I will set up my everlasting rest And shake off the bonds of unlucky stars From my world wearied body
Eyes look your last
Arms take your last embrace
And lips O you The doors of breath seal a timeless bargain With death who will take everything with a righteous kiss
You desperate sea captain now run your sea sick weary ship Onto the dashing rocks all at once
Here's to my love
Drinks
Your drugs are quick
So I die with a kiss
Saint Francis be my speed
How often tonight Have my old feet stumbled over graves
Who's there
It’s me a friend and one that knows you well
Blessings on you
Tell me good my friend What torch is over there that wastes giving his light To grubs and eyeless skulls
As far as I can see It burns in the Capulet’s tomb
It does holy sir and my master is in there One that you love
Who is it
Romeo
How long has he been in there
A full half hour
Go with me to the tomb
Stay then I'll go alone
Fear comes over me
O I’m very much afraid that some evil unlucky thing has happened
As I was sleeping under this yew tree here I dreamed that my master and another fought And that my master killed him
Romeo
What do these master less and gory swords mean By lying here with blood on them in this place of peace
Romeo
O you’re pale
Who else
What Paris too
And you’re covered in blood
Ah what an unlucky hour Is guilty of this lamentable event
The lady is waking up
O comfortable friar
Where is my lord
I remember well where I should be And here I am
Where is my Romeo
I hear some noise
A greater power than we can contradict Has opposed our plans
Come come away
Your husband in your bosom lies dead there And Paris too
Come I'll hide you Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
Don’t stay to question what happened because the guard is coming
Come go good Juliet
I don’t dare to stay longer
Go get away from here because I will not leave
What's here
A cup closed in my true love's hand
Poison I see has been his timeless end
O husband
You drank it all and Didn’t leave just a friendly drop To help me join you
I will kiss your lips
Maybe some poison is still on them To make me die by restoring me
Your lips are warm
Lead boy
Which way is it
Yes noise
Then I'll be brief
O happy dagger
Go some of you whoever you find arrest
Pitiful sight
Here the Count lies slain And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead Who has been buried in this tomb for two days
We see the ground on which these sorrows lie But we cannot find the true ground of all these piteous woes Without knowing what happened
Here's Romeo's man
We found him in the churchyard
Hold him in safety until the prince arrives
Here is a friar trembling sighing and weeping
We took this chisel edged pick and this shovel from him As he was coming from this side of the churchyard
Very suspicious
Hold the friar too
What unlucky event is up so early That calls me from my morning's rest
What’s the matter that they scream so loudly in the streets
The people in the street cry “Romeo” Some “Juliet” and some “Paris” and all run With open outcries toward our tomb
What noise startles in our ears
Sovereign here lies Count Paris slain And Romeo dead and Juliet who was dead before No warm and newly killed
Search seek and know how this foul murder happened
Here is a friar and dead Romeo's man With instruments on him that are fit to open These dead men's tombs
O heaven
O wife look how our daughter bleeds
This dagger has been mistaken for behold his empty Case is on the back of Montague And it’s misplaced in my daughter's bosom
O me
this sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a tomb
Come Montague because you are up early To see your son and heir taken down even earlier
For pity’s sake my lord my wife died tonight
Grief of my son's exile has killed her
What additional sorrow conspires against my old age
Look and you’ll see
O you stupid boy
What kind of manners is it To go to a grave before your father
And then I will be in charge of your sorrows And lead you even to death
In the meantime do nothing And let the investigation be do patiently
Bring out the suspects
I am the greatest able to do least Yet most suspected as the time and place Cast suspicion on me as guilty of this sad murder And here I stand both to accuse and free Myself condemned and myself excused
Then tell what you know about all of this
I will be brief for I don’t have enough breath to This tedious tale
Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet And she there dead was Romeo's faithful wife
I married them and their secret wedding day Was Tybalt's doomsday whose untimely death Banished the new made bridegroom from this city For whom Juliet pined and not for Tybalt
You to remove that siege of grief from her Engaged and would have married her against her will To Count Paris
Then she comes to me And with wild looks asks me to devise some means To get her of this second marriage Or right there in my cell she would kill herself
Then gave I her according to my craft with herbs A sleeping potion which took effect As I intended for it made her Seem dead
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo That he should come home this bad night To help to take her from her borrowed grave At the time that the potion would wear off
But the man who carried my letter Friar John Was delayed by accident and last night Returned my letter to me
Then all alone At the prearranged hour of her waking up I came to take her from her relative's tomb Intending to keep her close at my cell Until I could easily send for Romeo
But when I got here some minutes before the time Of her waking up here the noble Paris Lay and true Romeo both untimely dead
We still know you are a holy man
Where's Romeo's man
What can he say about this
I brought news of Juliet's death to my master And then he came from Mantua by horse To this same place to this same tomb
He asked me to give his father this letter And threatened me with death going into the tomb If I didn’t leave and I left him there
Give me the letter
I will read it
Where is the Count’s page who called the guards
Servant what was your master doing in this place
He came to scatter flowers on his lady's grave And asked me to stand off to the side and so I did
Then here comes one with light to open the tomb And by and by my master drew his sword on him And then I ran away to call the guards
Where are these enemies
Capulet Montague See what a cruel calamity is caused your hate That heaven finds a way to kill your joys with love
And I for disregarding your feud too Have lost a number of relatives
We are all are punished
O brother Montague give me your hand
This is my daughter's dowry for I can command No more
Romeo's shall be as rich lying by his lady's side Poor sacrifices of our hatred
This morning brings a gloomy peace with it
The sun will not show his head for sorrow
Good
Let’s go my good men
Look lively look lively my good men
Quick quick
Take in the top sail
Listen to the Captain's whistle
To the storm] Blow your wind until you burst so long as there’s room enough for us
Where's the Captain
Keep the men moving
Please now keep below
Where is the Captain officer in charge
Don’t you hear him
No good man be patient
I’ll be patient when the sea is patient
Get going
What do these noisy storms care about the name of king
Don’t bother us
Good man even now remember whom you have aboard
No one that I love more than myself
You are a council member if you can command these elements to be silent And make this present storm more peaceful we won’t need To work the ropes anymore
I get great comfort from this fellow
I don’t think he has been marked for drowning his complexion is perfect for being hanged
Hold your position good Fate for his hanging
Make the rope of his hanging our rope for the anchor because the one we have now does us little good
If he is not born to be hanged then our present state is pitiful
Down with the top mast
Quick
Lower lower
A cry inside] Damn their screaming
What are you doing here
Shall we give up and drown
Do you intend to sink us
Damn your voice you loud cursing selfish dog
Then go to work
Hang dog hang
Bastard arrogant noisemaker we’re less afraid to be drowned than you are
I'll wager against his drowning even if the ship was no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unsatisfied mistress
We’re all lost
Say your prayers say your prayers
We’re all lost
What must our voices be ignored
The King and Prince are saying prayers
Let’s join them Since our predicament is the same as theirs
I am out of patience
He'll still be hanged Although every drop of water swears against it And open very wide to fill him up
Mercy on us”  “We’re breaking up we’re breaking up” ”Goodbye my wife and children”  “Goodbye brother” ”We’re breaking up we’re breaking up we’re breaking up”  Let's all sink with the King
Let's tell him goodbye
Right now I would give a 220000 yards of sea for an acre of bare ground a long wasteland brown brush anything
If my dearest father you have put the wild waters Into this fury by your magic stop them
It seems that the sky would pour down stinking boiling tar Except that the sea mounting to the cloud’s cheek Puts the fire out
Poor souls they perished
If I had been any god of power I would Have sunk the sea on the earth before It would have swallowed the good ship and The souls that were her cargo
No harm done
I have done nothing except to protect you Protect you my dear one you my daughter who Doesn’t know what you are not knowing Where I come from or that I better Than Prospero master of a full poor dwelling And your not so proud father
It never entered my mind To know more
It is time I should tell you more
Give me your hand And take my magic cloak from me So Lie there my magic Wipe your eyes have comfort
The sad spectacle of the wreck which touched The very virtue of compassion in you I have ordered so safely with similar use of my magic That there is no soul  No not so much damage as to one hair Happened to any creature on the vessel Which you heard cry which you saw sink
Sit down Because you must now know more
You have often Started to tell me who I am but you stopped And left me to a useless questioning Concluding “Wait not yet” Now it’s time The very minute asks you to listen carefully Obey and listen
Can you remember A time before we came to this dwelling
I don’t think you can because then you weren’t Three years old yet
Certainly sir I can
How
It is faded And rather like a dream than a definite Memory in my mind
Didn’t I once have Four or five women once that took care of me
You did and more Miranda
But how is it That this memory lives in your mind
What else do You see in the old dark bottomless pit of time
If you remember anything before you came here How you came here you may remember
But I don’t remember coming here
Your mother was a piece of virtue and She said you were my daughter and your father Was Duke of Milan and his only heir A princess   born no less
O the heavens
What foul play did we have that we left there
Or was it a blessing that we did
Both both my girl
By foul play as you say we were lifted from there But blessedly helped here
Please go on
My brother and your uncle called Antonio  Please listen to me that a brother should Be so guilty of breaking a trust he whom I loved in All the world after you and I let him Manage of my city since at that time It was the first of all the cities And Prospero the best duke being considered so In dignity and for the liberal arts Without equal since these two items took up all my time in study I cast the government on my brother And I became a stranger to my city being absorbed And wrapped up in my secret studies
Your false uncle  Are you listening to me
Sir very carefully
Oh good sir I am
Please listen to me
My neglecting worldly responsibilities like that Dedicating everything to seclusion and the bettering Of my mind with that which only by being so secluded Was worth more than all popular opinion awoke in my False brother an evil nature and my trust Like a good parent made him Lie a lie as great As my trust was which had no limit indeed A confidence without boundaries
Playing the lord like that Not only with what my money yielded But also whatever else my power might get him like one Who having lied so often by telling it enough Made his memory such a sinner that it gave Truth to his own lie he believed He was indeed the Duke making substitution for me And wearing the outward show of royalty With all rights and privileges Here his ambition growing  Are you listening
Your tale sir would cure deafness
To have no separation between this part he played And the man he played it for he had to become the Absolute Duke of Milan
For me poor man my library Was dukedom large enough now he believes that I am Incapable of performing my political duties he makes an alliance  He was so hungry for power with the King of Naples To give Naples annual protection money pledge allegiance Surrender his small crown to Naples’ crown and bend The dukedom which had never bowed before alas poor Milan  To most dishonorable bowing
Oh the heavens
Listen to the situation and the event Then tell me if this might be a brother
I should sin only To think nobly of my grandmother Good women have had bad sons
Now the situation
This King of Naples being an old enemy Of mine listens my brother's request Which was that he instead of the promises Of allegiance and I don’t know how much protection money Should presently drive me and my family Out of the dukedom and give the fair city of Milan With all the honors to my brother which With a treacherous army recruited on a midnight Assigned to the purpose Antonio opened The gates of Milan and in the dead of darkness The ones given the job hurried Me and your crying self from there
A pity that it should be so
I not remembering how I cried out then Will cry it out all over again it is a moment That makes my eyes cry
Listen a little bit more And then I'll bring you to the present situation Which is now here without which this story Would be most irrelevant
Why didn’t they Destroy us then and there
Good question girl My tale invites that question
There they launched us To cry to the sea that roared at us to sigh To the winds whose pity sighing back again Only did us loving wrong
what trouble I was to you then
Oh you were an angel That saved me
You smiled Instilled with strength from heaven When I have covered the sea with salty tears Groaning under my load which raised in me A new strength to put with Whatever should follow
How did we come ashore
By Divine Providence
We had some food and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo who being then appointed Supervisor of this plot  gave us out of his goodness with Rich garments linens stuffs and other necessities Which have since been very useful so of his gentleness Knowing how I loved my books he supplied me With volumes from my own library that I prize more than my dukedom
I wish I might Only see that man again
We arrived here on this island and here I your schoolmaster have made you grow more Than other princes can who have more time For worthless hours and tutors that are not as careful
Heavens thank you for it
And now please sir  Because it is still on my mind your reason For raising this storm at sea
Know this much
Now my dear lady by most strange accident Generous Luck has brought my enemies To this shore and by my knowledge of things to come I find my highest point depends on A very lucky star that if I don’t seek its influence now And overlook it my fortunes Will sink forever after
I am ready now
Approach my Ariel Come
I come To answer your best requests is it to fly To swim to dive into the fire to ride On the curled clouds give Ariel and all his quality Your strong requests
In every detail
My brave spirit
Who is so firm so constant that this noisy disturbance Would not infect his sanity
There wasn’t a soul that Only felt a fever of the madness and played Some tricks out of desperation
All except the sailors Jumped in the foaming ocean and abandoned ship Then I was all on fire the King's son Ferdinand With hair standing up straight  then like reeds not hair  Was the first man that jumped crying “Hell is empty And all the devils are here” Why that's my spirit
But wasn’t this near the shore
Close by my master
But are they safe Ariel
Not even a hair died Not a spot on their clothing But fresher than they were before and as you ordered me I have dispersed them in groups around the island
I have brought the king's son ashore by himself And I left him cooling off with the air that blows gently In a remote spot of the island and sitting His arms sadly folded like this
Tell me how you have disposed Of the King's ship the sailors And all the rest of the fleet
Except that there's more work
What time of the day is it
Past noon
At least two hours past that
The time between six and now Must be spent most preciously by us both
Is there more work
Since you give me so much trouble Let me remind you what you have promised Which is not yet done for me
How is it now
Moody
What is it you demand
My freedom
Before the debt is paid
No more
Please Remember I have worked faithfully for you Told you no lies made no mistakes served Without a grudge or grumblings
You promised To give it to me after a full year
Do you forget From what a torment I freed you
No
You do and you think it’s a lot to walk the waves Of the ocean To run on the sharp wind of the north To do my business under the earth When it is baked with frost
I don’t sir
You lie malignant thing
Have you forgotten The foul witch Sycorax who had grown in to a circle With age and envy
Have you forgotten her
No sir
You have
Where was she born
Speak tell me
Sir in Algeria
I must recount What you have been once a month Which you forget
They would not take her life for one thing she did
Isn’t this true
Yes sir
This blue eyed hag was brought here pregnant And was left here by sailors
Then this was an island except for the son that she had here A freckled pup born of a witch not resembling Any human shape
Yes Caliban her son
I say he’s a dull thing that Caliban Whom now I keep as a servant
I thank you master
If you make any more complaints I will open an oak And put you inside it until You have howled away twelve more years
Do so and after two days I will set you free
That's my noble master
What shall I do
Go change into a spirit And come here invisibly go come here with care
Awake dear heart awake
You have slept well Awake
The strangeness of your story Made me very sleepy
Shake it off
Come on We'll visit Caliban my slave who never Gives us a kind answer
It is a villain sir that I don’t like to look at
But as it is We can’t dismiss him he makes our fire Fetches in our wood and serves in jobs That are to our advantage What hey
There's enough wood inside
When
Fine apparition
My lord it shall is done
You poisonous slave fathered by the devil himself Through your wicked mother come out
Let a dew as wicked as any my mother brushed From a polluted bog with raven's feather Fall on both of you
A south west wind blow on you And blister you all over
I must eat my dinner
This island's mine through Sycorax my mother Which you took from me
All the charms Of Sycorax toads beetles bats fall on you
Because I am all of the subjects that you have Who was first my own king and here you chain me To this hard rock while you keep from me The rest of the island
You most lying slave Whom beatings may move not kindness
I have used you Filth as you are with human care and let you live In my own dwelling until you tried to rape My daughter
I wish I had
You stopped me I would have populated This island with Calibans
Disgusting slave In which any type of goodness won’t take hold Being capable of every evil
Offspring of a witch come here
Get fuel for us and you had better be quick About answering the other business
So slave get going
Come to these yellow sands And then take my hands Bow courteously when you have and kiss me  The wild waves are silent  Dance gracefully here and there And sweet spirits listen to the chorus
Listen listen
Chorus off stage Bow wow
at different times)] Listen listen
Is it in the air or the earth
It’s stopped and surely it’s for Some god of the island
No it begins again
Sea spirits ring his death bell every hour [Chorus (off stage) Ding dong
The little song reminds me of my drowned father
This is not an act of man nor any sound Like those on earth I hear it now above me
What is it
A spirit
Lord how it looks about
I might call him A divine thing because I have never seen Anything so natural that was so noble
Aside] It goes just the way I see That my soul wants it Spirit fine spirit
I'll free you Within two days for this
I’m not a miracle sir But certainly a virgin
My language
What
The best
What would happen to you if the King of Naples heard you
An alone thing as I am now that is amazed To hear you speak of Naples
He hears me And I weep because he does I myself am Naples Who saw and I haven’t stopped crying saw The King my father wrecked
How sad for mercy
Yes believe me and all his lords the Duke of Milan And his brave son being two of those lost
Aside
Why speaks my father so roughly
Aside
Oh
To FERDINAND] One word more I order you that you wait on me
Here you steal The name you don’t own and have put yourself On this island as a spy to win it From me the lord of it
No I swear it as a man
Follow me
No I will resist such treatment until My enemy has more power to fight
What
Don’t hang on my clothes
Sir have pity I'll be his guarantee
Silence
One word more Shall make me scold you if not hate you
Hush
To many men this is a Caliban And they are angels to him
You shall be as free As the mountain winds if you only do Exactly every detail of my command
Please peace
Any comfort he gets is like cold oatmeal
The visitor won’t abandon him like that
Sir  One speak
You have taken it more seriously than I meant you to
Therefore my lord  Damn it what a waste he makes of his words
Please spare me
The old rooster
The young rooster
OK What’s the bet
A hearty laugh
It’s a bet
Though this island seems to be deserted  Ha ha ha
So now you're paid
Unable to be lived on and almost out of reach  Still  Still  He couldn’t resist it
It has to be of mild tender and delicate climate
Climate was a delicate mistress
Yes and mild as he has said most knowledgeably
The air here is very sweet for us
Or as it were perfumed by a swamp
True except the means to live it
There's none or little of that
How lush and lusty the grass looks
How green
The ground indeed is orangey
With a touch of green in it
He doesn’t miss much
No he only totally misses the truth
But the special thing about it is which is indeed almost beyond belief  As many verified “special things” are
That our garments being as they were drenched in the ocean have nevertheless retained their freshness and sheen seeming to be just cleaned rather than stained with salt water
If only one of his pockets could speak wouldn’t it say he lies
Yes or hide the report in the pocket
I think our garments are now as fresh as they were when we first put them in Africa at the wedding of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis
It was a sweet wedding and we were doing so well on our return
Tunis was never graced before with anything equal to their queen
Not since widow Dido's time
Widow
Like hell she was
How did she become a widow
Widow Dido
Widow Dido” you said
You made me study that one she was from Carthage not of Tunis
This Tunis sir was Carthage
Carthage
Trust me Carthage
His word is more miraculous than the magic harp
He has raised the wall and houses too
What impossible subject will he make easy next
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son as an apple
And sowing the seeds of it in the ocean create more islands
Yes
Why in good time
To ALONSO
Sir we were discussing how our garments now seem as fresh as they were when we were at the wedding of your daughter who is now Queen in Tunis
And the rarest person that ever came there
Stop please widow Dido
Oh
Widow Dido yes widow Dido
Isn’t my jacket sir as fresh as the first day I wore it
I mean in a way
You cram these words into my ears against The stomach of my sense
I wish I had never Married my daughter there
Because coming from there My son is lost and in my opinion she is too Who is so far away from Italy That I shall never see her again
No no he's gone
Sir you may thank yourself for this great loss Since you wouldn’t bless our Europe with your daughter But would rather marry her to an African Where she is at least out of your sight You who has cause to shed tears about it
Please peace
You were kneeled to and otherwise begged By all of us and the fair soul herself Considered at which option she should take Between reluctance and obedience
So is the most difficult loss
My lord Sebastian The truth you speak lacks some gentleness And proper timing you rub the wound When you should bring the Band Aid
Very well
And almost like a licensed surgeon
It is bad weather in us all good sir When you are cloudy
Very bad
If I had a plantation of this island my lord  Listen plant it with plants that sting
Or the antidote for stinging plants or hollyhocks
And if the king were on it what would I do
In the country I would carry out all things By opposites because I wouldn’t admit Any kind of traffic have no one named magistrate Appeals before a court wouldn’t be recognized riches poverty And slavery none treaties lines of succession Boundaries boundary lines of land farming vineyards none No use of metal corn or wine or oil No occupations all men idle all And women too only innocent and pure No supreme ruler  But he would be king on it
No marrying among his subjects
None man all are idle whores and rogues
I would govern with perfection like yours sir To surpass the golden age
Save his Majesty
Long live Gonzalo
I really do believe your highness and did it to provide opportunity to these gentlemen who have similar common sense and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing
It was you we laughed at
Who is nothing to you in this kind of merry joking so you may continue and still laugh at nothing
What a hard blow that was
If it had not fallen dead flat
You are gentlemen of brave spirit you would lift the moon out of her orbit if she would continue in it for five weeks without changing
We would so and then go swindling
No good my lord don’t be angry
No I promise you I won’t risk my reputation so stupidly
Will you laugh me asleep because I am exhausted
Go to sleep and listen to us
I wish my eyes Would shut up my thoughts by closing I think They want to do so
We two my lord Will guard your person while you sleep And watch for your safety
Thank you
Amazingly sleepy
What a strange drowsiness possesses them
It is the nature of the climate
Why Doesn’t then make our eyelids close
I don’t find Myself wanting to sleep
Me either I’m wide awake
They all fell asleep together as if they all agreed They dropped as if hit by a thunder stroke
Aren’t you listening to me speak
I do and surely It is a sleepy language and you talk In your sleep
What is it you said
This is a strange rest to be asleep With eyes wide open standing speaking moving And yet so fast asleep
Noble Sebastian You let your fortune sleep   die rather wink While you are waking
You snore distinctly There's meaning in your snores
Well I am standing water
I'll teach you how to flow
Do so laziness I inherited teaches me to go down Oh
If you only knew how you appreciate the purpose While you mock it like this
How in stripping it bare You invest more in it
Men that flow backward indeed Most often run too near to the bottom By their own fear or laziness
Like this sir Although this lord of weak memory this man Who shall be remembered little When he is buried here has almost persuaded  Because he's a spirit of persuasion only he Professes to persuade the King’s son is alive It is as impossible that he's not drowned As he who sleeps here swims
I have no hope That he's not drowned
To have no hope that he is drowned is another way to have such a high hope That even Ambition can’t see beyond it But defies belief
Will you agree with me That Ferdinand is drowned
He's gone
Then tell me Who's the next heir of Naples
Claribel
What are you talking about How are you saying
It’s true my brother's daughter is Queen of Tunis She also inherits Naples there is some distance Between the two countries
There is one that can rule Naples As well as the man who is sleeping lords that can talk As much and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo I myself could make Asses of these lords 
O I wish you were of The same mind as I am
What a sleep this is For your advancement
Do you understand me
I think I do
And how does your happiness Advance your own good fortune
For all the rest They'll take a suggestion as a cat licks up milk They'll turn the clock to any business that We say is right for the hour
Your case dear friend Shall be my authority for what I do as you go to Milan I'll come by Naples
Draw your sword one stroke Shall free you from the taxes which you pay And I the king shall be devoted to you
Pull out your sword when I do And when I raise my hand you do the same So that it falls on Gonzalo
While you lie here snoring Open eyed Plotting Takes his time
If you care about your life Shake off slumber and beware
Now good angels Preserve the King
Why how is it now
Ho awake
Why are your swords drawn
What's the matter
It was most terrible to hear
I heard nothing
Did you hear this Gonzalo
On my honor sir I heard a humming And it was a strange one too which woke me up
Lead us away from this place and let's search further For my poor son
Heavens protect him from these beasts
Because he is surely on the island
Lead us away
All the diseases that the sun sucks up From bogs swamps flats fall on Prospero and make him A disease inch by inch
His spirits listen to me And yet I have to curse
Here comes a spirit of his to torment me For bringing in wood too slowly
I'll fall down flat Maybe he won’t notice me
A fish he smells like a fish a very old and fish like smell a kind that’s not like the freshest small fish
A strange fish
When they won’t give a penny to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten dollars to see a dead Indian
He has legs like a man and his fins look like arms
Warm honestly
I now give my opinion hold it no longer this is no fish but an islander that has lately been struck by lightning
Thunder] Alas the storm has come again
I will stay covered here until the last of the storm is over
This is a nasty tune too but here's my comfort
What's the matter
Do we have devils here
I have not escaped drowning to be afraid now of your four legs because it has been said “As proper a man as ever went on four legs can’t make him give ground” and it shall be said so again while Stephano still breathes through His nostrils
This is some monster of the island with four legs who has got as I take it malaria
Where the devil should he learn our language
He's having a fit now and doesn’t talk sense
Four legs and two voices a most delicate monster
His forward voice now is speaking well of his friend his backward voice is uttering dirty speeches and insults
If all the wine in my bottle will help him I will help his malaria
Come
Amen
I will pour some in your other mouth
Stephano
Does your other mouth call me
If you are Trinculo come out
You are very Trinculo indeed
How did you come to be the attack of this dreamer
Can he spit out Trinculos
I took him to be killed with lightning
But aren’t you drowned Stephano
I hope now you aren’t drowned
Hass the storm blown over
I hid myself under the dead dreamer’s covering because I was afraid of the storm
And are you living Stephano
O Stephano two Neapolitans escaped
Please don’t turn me around so much my stomach is upset
How did you escape
How did you come here
Swear by this bottle how you came here I escaped on a barrel of wine which the sailors heaved overboard by this bottle
Which I made of the bark of a tree with my own hands since I was cast ashore
I'll swear on that bottle to be your true subject because that liquor is not earthly
Passing the bottle] Here kiss the book [gives TRINCULO a drink]
Though you can swim like a duck you are made like a goose
Have you not dropped from heaven
Out of the moon I assure you I was the Man in the Moon a long time ago
The Man in the Moon
I'll show you every fertile inch of the island And I will kiss your foot
Please be my god
Come on then down and swear
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy headed monster
A most nasty monster
I could find it in my heart to beat him  Come kiss
I'll show you the best springs I'll pluck you berries I'll fish for you and get you enough wood
A plague on the tyrant that I serve
I'll carry no more sticks for him but follow you You amazing man
A most ridiculous monster to make a a poor drunkard amazing
Please let me bring you where crabs grow And I will dig you peanuts with my long nails I’ll show you a bird's nest and teach you how To catch the nimble monkey I'll bring you To clustering filbert nuts and sometimes I'll get you Young falcons from the rock
Will you go with me
Goodbye master goodbye goodbye
I'll make no more mothers for fish Or fetch in firing wood When asked to Or scrape dishes or wash dishes 'Ban 'Ban Ca Caliban Has a new master Get a new man
Freedom high day
High day freedom
Freedom high day freedom
O brave monster
Lead the way
This mean task of mine Would be as heavy to me as hateful except that The mistress I serve makes alive what's dead And makes my labors pleasurable Oh
She is Ten times more gentle than her crabby father And he's made of harshness
I forget But these sweet thoughts even refresh my work Keep me very busy at least when I do it
O most dear mistress The sun will set before I finish What I must work to do
If you'll sit down I'll carry your logs the while
Please give me that I'll carry it to the pile
It would be as natural to me As it is to you and I should do it Much more easily because my good will is in it And yours is against it
Aside] Poor worm
You look tired
No noble mistress it is fresh morning with me When you are near at night
Please  Chiefly that I might say it in my prayers  What is your name
Miranda O my father
I have broken his command not to say so
Admired Miranda
Indeed the top of admiration worth What's dearest to the world
So perfect and so peerless are created Out of every creature's best virtues
But I jabber on A little too wildly and there I am forgetting My father's lessons
Do you love me
I Beyond all limit of whatever else in the world Do love prize honor you
I am a fool To cry at what I am happy about
Aside] Fair meeting Of two most rare loves
Heavens rain grace On that which grows between them
Why do you cry
At my unworthiness that dares not offer to you What I desire to give you or much less take What I shall die to want from you
But this is a little thing And it seeks to hide itself all the more It shows how big it is
Here bashful cunning
And prompt me plain and holy innocence
I am your wife if you will marry me If not I'll die your virgin
You may deny me To be your friend but I'll be your servant Whether you will want me or not
My mistress dearest And I am humble forever
My husband then
Yes with a heart as willing As slavery was ever willing of freedom here's my hand
And mine with my heart in it and now goodbye Until half an hour later
A thousand thousand
I'll go to my book Because still before supper time I must complete A lot of business relating to these two
Servant monster
The folly of this island
They say there's only five on this island we’re three of them if the other two are brained like us the state shakes
Where else should they be set
He would be a brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail
You shall be my lieutenant monster or my main officer
Your lieutenant if you like he's no main officer
We'll not run Monsieur monster
Or leave either but you'll lie like dogs and still say nothing neither
Dreamer speak once in your life if you are a good dreamer
How does your honor
Let me lick your shoe
I won’t serve him he’s not valiant
Why you deboshed fish you was there ever a coward that has drunk so much sack as I have today
Will you tell a monstrous lie being only half fish and half a monster
Look how he mocks me
Will you let him my lord
Look look again
Bite him to death please
The poor monster's my subject and he shall not suffer indignity
I thank my noble lord
Will it please you to listen once again to the favor I asked you
As I told you before I am subject to a tyrant sorcerer that has cheated me of the island by his cunning
You lie
Trinculo if you trouble him any more in his tale by this hand I will displace some of your teeth
Why I said nothing
You shall be lord of it and I'll serve you
How shall this be done
Can you bring me to the party
You lie you can’t
What a drunken imbecile is this
Trinculo run into no further danger interrupt the monster one word more and I swear I'll turn you out of doors and make a dried fish out of you
Why what did I do
I did nothing
I'll go farther away
Didn’t you say he lied
You lie
Did I
Take that
As you like this give me the lie again
Ha ha ha
Beat him enough after a little time I'll beat him too
Stand farther away Come on continue
Remember To possess his books first because without them He's only a fool as I am and hasn’t One spirit to command they all hate him As deeply as I do
Is it so brave a girl
Do you like the plot Trinculo
Excellent
Yes on my honor
You make me happy I am full of pleasure
At your request monster I will do reason any reason
Come on Trinculo let us sing
Flout them and scout them and scout them and flout them Thought is free
That's not the tune
What is this noise
This is the tune of our song played by the picture of Nobody
O forgive me my sins
Are you afraid
No monster not me
Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about my ears and sometimes voices That if I then had wakened after long sleep Will make me sleep again and then in dreaming The clouds I thought would open and show riches Ready to drop on me that when I wakened I cried to dream again
This will prove a brave kingdom to me where I shall have my music for nothing
When Prospero is destroyed
He lays it on
Will you come
I'll follow Stephano
Be patient I have to rest
Old lord I can’t blame you
I am so exhausted My spirits are dulled sit down and rest
Well let him go
I am very glad that he's so out of hope
Don’t for one denial lose the action That you swore to do
We will take the next Advantage thoroughly
What music is this
My good friends listen
Marvelous sweet music
Give us kind keepers heavens
What were these
A living puppet show
Now I will believe That there are unicorns that in Arabia There is one tree the throne of the phoenix one phoenix Reigning there now
If I should report this now in Naples Would they believe me
If I should say I saw similar islanders  Because truly these are people of the island  Who though they are of monstrous shape yet notice that Their manners are more gentle than those of Our human generation that you shall find Many no almost any
Honest lord What you say is true because some of you there present Are worse than devils
Praise in departing
They vanished strangely
Not I
Truly sir you don’t need to be afraid
When we were boys Who would believe that there were mountaineers Covered with dew like bulls who had throats with pockets Of flesh hanging from them
Or that there were similar men Whose heads were in their chests
Now we find that One traveler out of five will bring us News about them
You are three men of sin whom Destiny That has the power over this lower world And what is in it has caused the never satisfied sea to spit up you and on this island Where man doesn’t live you among men Being most unfit to live
I have made you crazy And even with similar courage men hang and drown Themselves
You fools
If you could hurt us Your swords are now too heavy for your strengths And won’t be lifted up
But remember  Because that's my business to you that you three From Milan replaced good Prospero Exposed him and his innocent child to the sea Which has repaid it for which evil deed The powers delaying but not forgetting have Angered the seas and shores yes all the creatures Against your peace of mind
In the name of something holy sir why stand you here In this strange stare
Therefore my son is embedded in the ooze and I'll seek him deeper than a piece of lead ever measured How deep the water is and I will lie there with him in the mud
Give me only one evil enemy at a time and I'll fight their legions again and again
I'll be right behind you
I beg you Whose joints move easier than mine to follow them swiftly And stop them from what this vision May now provoke them to do
If I have punished you too harshly Your payment makes up for it because I Have given you here a third of my own life Or the part for which I live who once again I give to you
I would believe it Against a fortuneteller
What Ariel
My hard working servant Ariel
What would my powerful master like
Here I am
You and your meaner fellows performed your last jobs Very well and I must use you In another similar trick
Right now
Yes with a twink
Before you can say “Come” and “Go” And breathe twice and cry “so so” Each one tripping on his toe Will be here with tricks and pranks
Do you love me master
No
Dearly my delicate Ariel
Don’t come near Until you hear me call
Well I understand
I promise you sir The cold white virgin snow on my heart Holds back my passion
Well  Now come my Ariel
Bring a conclusion Rather than need a spirit appear and quickly
No talking
All eyes
Be silent
Approach rich Ceres to entertain her
To celebrate a contract of true love And to bestow some free gifts On the blessed lovers
Tell me heavenly rainbow if you know If Venus the goddess of love or Cupid her son Now wait on the queen
Since they plotted With the dark god of the underworld to kidnap my daughter I have sworn not to be in Her and her blind boy's scandalous company
Don’t be afraid Of her company
They thought they would do Some naughty charm on this man and maiden Who have vowed that they will not sleep together Until the god of marriage's torch is lit but they thought so in vain
Highest Queen of State Great Juno comes I know her by her walk
How does my generous sister
Go with me To bless these two that they may be prosperous And honored in their children
Honor riches marriage blessing Long life and many children Hourly joys be always yours
Juno sings her blessings on you
Earth's increase plenty of feasting Barns and storage for game never empty Vines growing with clustering bunches of grapes Plants bowing with heavy loads of fruit  Spring come to you as long as possible Even to the very end of harvest
Scarcity and want shall ignore you Ceres' blessing so be on you
Spirits which by my magic I have called from their borders to enact My present wishes
Sweet now silence
You nymphs called Water Nymphs of the winding brooks With your oat edged crowns and always harmless looks Leave your fresh waters and answer your summons To this green land Juno commands you
You sun burned reapers tired of August Come here from the rows you have plowed and be happy Make it a holiday put on your rye straw hats And meet every one pf these fresh nymphs In country dancing
Well done
avoid no more
These our actors As I told you before were all spirits and Have melted into air into thin air And like the invisible fabric of this vision The cloud capped towers the gorgeous palaces The solemn temples the great world itself Yes all who inherit it shall dissolve And leave not even a clue behind As this pageant of no substance faded
Don’t be disturbed by my weakness
We wish your peace
I hang onto your thoughts
What's your pleasure
Spirit We must prepare to meet with Caliban
Tell me again where did you leave these varlets
I told you sir they were red hot with drinking So full of smoothness that they beat the air For breathing in their faces beat the ground For kissing their feet yet always bending Towards their project
Well done my bird
A devil a born devil on whose nature Kindness can never stick on whom my pains Taken humanely are all all lost quite lost And as his body grows uglier with age So his mind is diseased
I will plague them all Even to the point of their roaring
Come hang them on this line
Monster your fairy which you say is a harmless fairy has done little better than played us for fools
Monster I smell all horse piss at which my nose is highly offended
If I should take a displeasure against you look you  You were only a lost monster
I will fetch off my bottle although I’ll be head over heels in muck for my efforts
Please my king be quiet
Do that good deed which may make this island Your own forever and I your Caliban Your foot licker forever
O King Stephano
O peer
O worthy Stephano
Look what a wardrobe is here for you
Let it alone you fool it is only trash
O ho monster
Your Grace shall have it
The swelling disease drown this fool
What do you mean By being so stupidly fond like this on such goods
Let's get going And do the murder first
If he awakens He'll fill our skins with pinches from toe to head Turn us into strange stuff
I’ll have none of it
We shall lose our opportunity And we’ll all be turned into geese or into apes With villainous low foreheads
Go on carry this
And this
Yes and this
Hey Mountain hey
Silver
There it goes Silver
Fury Fury
There Tyrant there
Go order my goblins that they torment their joints With dry convulsions shorten up their muscles With long lasting cramps and make them more spotted With pinches than a leopard or mountain cat
Listen they roar
Let them be hunted soundly
What time is it
Six o’clock at which time my lord You said our work should end
I said so When first I raised the storm
Tell me my spirit How are the King and his followers doing
Confined together In the same fashion as you told me Just as you left them all prisoners sir In the grove of trees which weatherproofs your dwelling They can’t budge until you release them
Do you think so spirit
Mine would sir if I were human
Go release them Ariel
I'll break my spells I'll restore their senses And they shall be themselves again
I'll fetch them sir
You elves of hills brooks standing lakes and groves And you that chase the ebbing ocean on the sands Without leaving a foot print and run from him When he comes back you half puppets that Make the green ringlets sour by moonshine Where the ewe doesn’t bite and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms that are happy To hear the curfew sound by whose aid  Weak masters though you are I have dimmed The noontide sun called the mutinous winds And set roaring between the green sea and The blue sky I haven given fire to the dreaded Rattling thunder and split Jove's stout oak With his own lightning bolt I have made the strong based Land that stuck out into the ocean shake and plucked up The pine and cedar by the roots at my command graves Have awakened the dead opened the coffins and Let them walk out by my so powerful magic
A solemn song and the best comforter To an unsettled mind cure for your brains Now useless boiled inside your skull
Holy Gonzalo honorable man My eyes even sociable to the show of your eyes Cry like yours
The charm dissolves quickly And as the morning steals on into the night Melting the darkness so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that cloud Their clearer reason O good Gonzalo
Their understanding Begins to increase and the approaching tide of understanding Will shortly fill the reasonable shores of their minds That are now corrupt and muddy
Where the bee sucks there suck I In a flower’s bell I lie There I sleep when owls cry
Why that's my delicate Ariel
I drink in the air before me and return Before your pulse beats twice
All torment trouble wonder and amazement Live here
Some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country
First noble friend Let me embrace you whose honor can’t Be measured or confined
I won’t swear whether this is Or is not true
The devil speaks in him
No
Because you most wicked sir whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth I forgive Your worst fault all of them and require My dukedom from you which I know You must restore to me by necessity
If you are Prospero Give us details of how you were saved How you have met us here who were wrecked On this shore three hours ago where I have lost  How sharp the point of this memory is  My dear son Ferdinand
I am very sorry about it sir
The loss cannot be repaid and patience Says it is beyond her cure
I rather think You haven’t sought her help by whose soft grace I have received her royal aid for a similar loss And I am at peace
You a similar loss
As great to me as recently and to make the dear Loss tolerable I have much weaker means Than you have to comfort you because I Have lost my daughter
A daughter
When did you lose your daughter
In this last storm
I see these lords So much admire at this meeting That they eat their own common sense and scarcely think Their eyes tell them the truth
Their words Are natural breath but however you have Been jostled out of your senses know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Who was thrown out of Milan who most strangely landed On this shore where you were wrecked To be the lord of it
No more yet about this Because it is a story of day by day Not a story for a breakfast or Befitting this first meeting
Here I have few attendants And subjects none
Please look in
Since you have given me my dukedom again I will repay you with just as good a thing At least bring out a wonder to make you as happy As I am to have my dukedom
Sweet lord you lie to me
No my dearest love I wouldn’t for the world
Yes you would argue for a score of kingdoms And I would call it fair play
If this proves to be A vision of the island I shall lose One dear son twice
A most high miracle
Now all the blessings Of a glad father are all around you
Stand up and say how you came here
O wonder
How many goodly creatures are there here
How beautiful mankind is
O brave new world That has such people in it
It’s new to you
Who is this maiden with whom you were at play
Sir she is mortal But by immortal Providence she's mine
I chose her when I couldn’t ask my father For his advice or didn’t think I had a father
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan Who I have so often heard has a great reputation But that I never saw before of whom I have Received a second life and this lady makes him A second father to me
I am hers Only Oh
How oddly it will sound that I Must ask my child for forgiveness
I have wept inside Or should have spoken before this
I say Amen Gonzalo
Was the Duke of Milan thrown out of Milan that his children Should become kings of Naples
O rejoice Beyond a common joy and set it down With gold on lasting pillars
In one voyage Claribel found her husband at Tunis And Ferdinand her brother found a wife Where he himself was lost Prospero found his dukedom In a poor island and all of us found ourselves When no man was in his right minds
Let it be so
Amen
Here are more of us
I prophesied That if a gallows were on land this fellow could not drown
Now you blasphemer who sent grace overboard with Swearing don’t you have an oath on shore
Don’t you Have any mouth on land
What’s the news
The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company the next our ship  Which only three hours ago was wrecked we thought  Is water tight and ready and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea
Sir I have done all this service Since I left you
If I thought sir that I was well awake I'd try to tell you
Bravely my hard worker
You shall be free
How are you my gracious sir
There are still some few odd lads Missing from your company that you forget
Every man is on his own for all the rest and let no man take care for himself because all is only fortune Coragio
bully monster Coragio
If these are true eyes in my head here's a goodly sight
O Setebos these are brave spirits indeed
How fine my master is
I’m afraid He will beat me
Ha ha
What are these things my lord Antonio
Will money buy them
Very likely one of them Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable
I shall be pinched to death
Isn’t this Stephano my drunken butler
I have been in similar a pickle since I saw you last that I’m afraid will never get out of my bones
I won’t be afraid of blow flies
Why how is it now Stephano
Oh
Don’t touch me I am not Stephano but a cramp
You'd be king of the island servant
I should have been a sore one then
This is as strange a thing as I have ever looked on
Yes I will and I'll be wise hereafter And seek for grace
What a three times two ass I was to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool
Get going away
Here and your baggage back where you found it
Or stole it rather
I long To hear the story of your life which must Affect the ear strangely
