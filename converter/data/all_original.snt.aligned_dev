It is not yet near day.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn; No nightingale.
Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Yon light is not daylight; I know it, I.
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come, death, and welcome!
Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul?
It is, it is!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division; This doth not so, for she divideth us.
More light and light—more dark and dark our woes!
Madam!
Nurse?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
Farewell, farewell!
One kiss, and I'll descend.
I must hear from thee every day in the hour, For in a minute there are many days.
O, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo!
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our time to come.
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below, As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.
O Fortune, Fortune!
all men call thee fickle.
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him That is renown'd for faith?
Be fickle, Fortune, For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long But send him back.
Ho, daughter!
are you up?
Who is't that calls?
It is my lady mother.
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
Why, how now, Juliet?
Madam, I am not well.
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou could'st, thou could'st not make him live.
Therefore have done.
Some grief shows much of love; But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for.
Feeling so the loss, I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
What villain, madam?
That same villain Romeo.
Villain and he be many miles asunder.
God pardon him!
I do, with all my heart; And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
That is because the traitor murderer lives.
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
Then weep no more.
I'll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banish'd runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company; And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
Indeed I never shall be satisfied With Romeo till I behold him— dead — Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it; That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet.
O, how my heart abhors To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him, To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expects not, nor I look'd not for.
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
These are news indeed!
Here comes your father.
Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.
When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew, But for the sunset of my brother's son It rains downright.
How now?
a conduit, girl?
What, still in tears?
Evermore show'ring?
How now, wife?
Have you delivered to her our decree?
I would the fool were married to her grave!
Soft!
take me with you, take me with you, wife.
Is she not proud?
Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Proud can I never be of what I hate, But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
How, how, how, how, choplogic?
What is this?
Out, you green-sickness carrion!
Out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!
Fie, fie!
what, are you mad?
Hang thee, young baggage!
disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what—get thee to church a Thursday Or never after look me in the face.
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
My fingers itch.
Wife, we scarce thought us blest That God had lent us but this only child; But now I see this one is one too much, And that we have a curse in having her.
Out on her, hilding!
God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
And why, my Lady Wisdom?
I speak no treason.
May not one speak?
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl, For here we need it not.
You are too hot.
God's bread!
It makes me mad.
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend; An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
Trust to't.
Bethink you.
I'll not be forsworn.
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week; Or if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
How shall that faith return again to earth Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth?
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou?
Hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, Nurse.
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you; Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, I think it best you married with the County.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him.
An eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath.
Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first; or if it did not, Your first is dead—or 'twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him.
Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
And from my soul too; Else beshrew them both.
Amen!
What?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in; and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence’ cell, To make confession and to be absolv'd.
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
Ancient damnation!
O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue Which she hath prais'd him with above compare So many thousand times?
I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
On Thursday, sir?
The time is very short.
My father Capulet will have it so, And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
You say you do not know the lady's mind.
Uneven is the course; I like it not.
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death, And therefore have I little talk'd of love; For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous That she do give her sorrow so much sway, And in his wisdom hastes our marriage To stop the inundation of her tears, Which, too much minded by herself alone, May be put from her by society.
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
Come you to make confession to this father?
To answer that, I should confess to you.
Do not deny to him that you love me.
I will confess to you that I love him.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
The tears have got small victory by that, For it was bad enough before their spite.
Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth; And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now, Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.
O, shut the door!
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this County.
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise And with this knife I'll help it presently.
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time, Give me some present counsel; or, behold, 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak.
I long to die If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
Hold, daughter.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate an execution As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then is it likely thou wilt undertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That cop’st with death himself to scape from it; And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
Hold, then.
Go home, be merry, give consent To marry Paris.
Wednesday is to-morrow.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift; And hither shall he come; and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
Give me, give me!
O, tell not me of fear!
Hold!
I'll send a friar with speed To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
Love give me strength!
and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father.
So many guests invite as here are writ.
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can lick their fingers.
How canst thou try them so?
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers.
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
Go, begone.
We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
Ay, forsooth.
Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
How now, my headstrong?
Where have you been gadding?
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon.
Pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
Send for the County.
Go tell him of this.
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
I met the youthful lord at Laurence’ cell And gave him what becomed love I might, Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
Why, I am glad on't.
This is well.
Stand up.
This is as't should be.
Let me see the County.
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar, All our whole city is much bound to him.
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
No, not till Thursday.
There is time enough.
Go, nurse, go with her.
We'll to church to-morrow.
We shall be short in our provision.
Tis now near night.
Tush, I will stir about, And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
What, ho!
They are all forth; well, I will walk myself To County Paris, to prepare him up Against to-morrow.
My heart is wondrous light, Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
What, are you busy, ho?
Need you my help?
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries As are behoveful for our state to-morrow.
So please you, let me now be left alone, And let the nurse this night sit up with you; For I am sure you have your hands full all In this so sudden business.
Good night.
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
Farewell!
God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins That almost freezes up the heat of life.
I'll call them back again to comfort me.
Nurse!— What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, No!
This shall forbid it.
Lie thou there.
What if it be a poison which the friar Subtly hath ministr'd to have me dead, Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd Because he married me before to Romeo?
I will not entertain so bad a thought.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb, I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me?
There's a fearful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
O, look!
methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point.
Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come!
this do I drink to thee.
Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse.
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Come, stir, stir, stir!
The second cock hath crow'd, The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica; Spare not for cost.
Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow For this night's watching.
No, not a whit.
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; But I will watch you from such watching now.
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Now, fellow, what is there?
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
Make haste, make haste.
Sirrah, fetch drier logs.
Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs And never trouble Peter for the matter.
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be loggerhead.Good faith,'tis day.
The County will be here with music straight, For so he said he would.
I hear him near.
Nurse!
Wife!
What, ho!
What, nurse, I say!
I'll go and chat with Paris.
Hie, make haste, Make haste!
Mistress!
what, mistress!
Juliet!
Fast, I warrant her, she.
Why, lamb!
why, lady!
Fie, you slug-abed!
Why, love, I say!
madam!
sweetheart!
Why, bride!
What, not a word?
You take your pennyworths now!
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant, The County Paris hath set up his rest That you shall rest but little.
God forgive me!
I needs must wake her.
Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
Will it not be?
I must needs wake you.
Lady!
lady!
lady!
Alas, alas!
Help, help!
My lady's dead!
O well-a-day that ever I was born!
Some aqua-vitae, ho!
My lord!
my lady!
What noise is here?
O lamentable day!
What is the matter?
Look, look!
O heavy day!
O me, O me!
My child, my only life!
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help!
Call help.
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead!
Alack the day!
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
Ha!
let me see her.
Out alas!
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
O lamentable day!
O woful time!
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail, Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son, the night before thy wedding day Hath Death lain with thy wife.
See, there she lies, Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
I will die And leave him all.
Life, living, all is Death's.
Have I thought long to see this morning's face, And doth it give me such a sight as this?
Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
O woe!
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
Most lamentable day, most woeful day That ever ever I did yet behold!
O day!
O day!
O day!
O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this.
O woeful day!
O woeful day!
Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
O love!
O life!
not life, but love in death!
Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child!
O child!
my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou, dead!
alack, my child is dead, And with my child my joys are buried!
Peace, ho, for shame!
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions.
Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
O, in this love, you love your child so ill That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, In all her best array bear her to church; For though fond nature bids us all lament, Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; And go, Sir Paris.
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
Not a dump we!
Tis no time to play now.
You will not then?
No.
I will then give it you soundly.
What will you give us?
Then will I give you the serving-creature.
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
I will carry no crotchets.
I'll re you, I'll fa you.
Do you note me?
An you re us and fa us, you note us.
Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
Then have at you with my wit!
I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.
Answer me like men.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
Pretty!
What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.
Pretty too!
What say you, James Soundpost?
Faith, I know not what to say.
O, I cry you mercy!
you are the singer.
I will say for you.
It is ‘music with her silver sound’ because musi- cians have no gold for sounding.
Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress.’ What a pestilent knave is this same!
Hang him, Jack!
Come, we'll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne, And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!
And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
Ah me!
how sweet is love itself possess'd, When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
News from Verona!
How now, Balthasar?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady?
Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet?
That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument, And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you.
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
Is it e'en so?
Then I defy you, stars!
Thou knowest my lodging.
Get me ink and paper And hire posthorses.
I will hence to-night.
I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import Some misadventure.
Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
No, my good lord.
No matter.
Get thee gone And hire those horses.
I'll be with thee straight.
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let's see for means.
O mischief, thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary, And hereabouts he dwells, which late I noted In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples.
Meagre were his looks, Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, An alligator stuff'd, and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said, ‘An if a man did need a poison now Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.’ O, this same thought did but forerun my need, And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho!
apothecary!
Who calls so loud?
Come hither, man.
Let me have A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead, And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath As violently as hasty powder fir'd Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law Is death to any he that utters them.
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness And fearest to die?
My poverty but not my will consents.
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
Put this in any liquid thing you will And drink it off, and if you had the strength Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell.
Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua.
What says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
Going to find a barefoot brother out, One of our order, to associate me Here in this city visiting the sick, And finding him, the searchers of the town, Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign, Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth, So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
I could not send it—here it is again— Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, So fearful were they of infection.
Unhappy fortune!
By my brotherhood, The letter was not nice, but full of charge, Of dear import; and the neglecting it May do much danger.
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents; But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come— Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!
Give me thy torch, boy.
Hence, and stand aloof.
Whistle then to me, As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers.
Do as I bid thee, go.
I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
The obsequies that I for thee will keep Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What, with a torch?
Muffle me, night, a while.
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter.
Early in the morning See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Why I descend into this bed of death Is partly to behold my lady's face, But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger A precious ring—a ring that I must use In dear employment.
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry In what I further shall intend to do, By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
The time and my intents are savage-wild, More fierce and more inexorable far Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
So shalt thou show me friendship.
Take thou that.
Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth, Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
This is that banish'd haughty Montague That murdered my love's cousin—with which grief It is supposed the fair creature died— And here is come to do some villanous shame To the dead bodies.
I will apprehend him.
Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury.
O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself, For I come hither arm'd against myself.
Live, and hereafter say A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
I do defy thy conjuration And apprehend thee for a felon here.
Wilt thou provoke me?
Then have at thee, boy!
O Lord, they fight!
I will go call the watch.
O, I am slain!
If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
In faith, I will.
Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode?
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
Said he not so?
or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet To think it was so?
O, give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
O, no, a lantern, slaughtr'd youth, For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
How oft when men are at the point of death Have they been merry!
which their keepers call A lightning before death.
O, how may I Call this a lightning?
O my love!
my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquer'd.
Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin.
Ah, dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair?
Shall I believe That unsubstantial Death is amorous, And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee And never from this palace of dim night Depart again.
Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chambermaids.
O, here Will I set up my everlasting rest And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh.
Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace!
and, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
Drinks.
Thy drugs are quick.
Thus with a kiss I die.
Saint Francis be my speed!
how oft to-night Have my old feet stumbled at graves!
Who's there?
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Bliss be upon you!
Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls?
As I discern, It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, One that you love.
Who is it?
Romeo.
How long hath he been there?
Full half an hour.
Go with me to the vault.
Stay then; I'll go alone.
Fear comes upon me.
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him.
Romeo!
What mean these masterless and gory swords To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
Romeo!
O, pale!
Who else?
What, Paris too?
And steep'd in blood?
Ah, what an unkind hour Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.
O comfortable friar!
where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.
Where is my Romeo?
I hear some noise.
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents.
Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; And Paris too.
Come, I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
Come, go, good Juliet.
I dare no longer stay.
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
What's here?
A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
O churl!
drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after?
I will kiss thy lips.
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them To make me die with a restorative.
Thy lips are warm!
Lead, boy.
Which way?
Yea, noise?
Then I'll be brief.
O happy dagger!
Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight!
here lies the County slain; And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain this two days buried.
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry.
Here's Romeo's man.
We found him in the churchyard.
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard side.
A great suspicion!
Stay the friar too.
What misadventure is so early up, That calls our person from our morning rest?
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
The people in the street cry ‘Romeo,’ Some ‘Juliet,’ and some ‘Paris’; and all run, With open outcry, toward our monument.
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, Warm and new kill'd.
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man, With instruments upon them fit to open These dead men's tombs.
O heavens!
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house Is empty on the back of Montague, And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
O me!
this sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
Come, Montague; for thou art early up To see thy son and heir more early down.
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
What further woe conspires against mine age?
Look, and thou shalt see.
O thou untaught!
what manners is in this, To press before thy father to a grave?
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring, their head, their true descent; And then will I be general of your woes And lead you even to death.
Meantime forbear, And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder; And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
I married them; and their stol'n marriage day Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city; For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her, Betroth'd and would have married her perforce To County Paris.
Then comes she to me And with wild looks bid me devise some mean To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) A sleeping potion; which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death.
Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrowed grave, Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight Return'd my letter back.
Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred's vault; Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awaking, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man?
What can he say in this?
I brought my master news of Juliet's death; And then in post he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father, And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault, If I departed not and left him there.
Give me the letter.
I will look on it.
Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave; And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; And by-and-by my master drew on him; And then I ran away to call the watch.
Where be these enemies?
Capulet, Montage, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
And I, for winking at you, discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen.
All are punish'd.
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more Can I demand.
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie— Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Good, speak to the mariners.
Bestir Heigh, my hearts!
Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
Yare, yare!
Take in the topsail.
Tend to the Master's whistle!
Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!
Where's the Master?
To the Mariners] Play the men!
To the Mariners] Play the I pray now, keep below.
Where is the Master, Boatswain?
Do you not hear him?
Nay, good, be patient.
When the sea is.
Hence!
What cares these roarers for the name of the king?
Trouble us not.
Good, yet remember whom thou has aboard.
None that I more love than myself.
You are a counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more; use your authority.
I have great comfort from this fellow.
Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is perfect gallows.
Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging.
Make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage.
If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
Down with the topmast!
Yare!
Lower, lower!
A cry within] A plague [A cry within] A plague upon this howling!
What do you here?
Shall we give o'er and drown?
Have you a mind to sink?
A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!
Work you, then.
Hang, cur, hang, you whoreson, insolent noise- maker!
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
I'll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
All lost!
To prayers, to prayers!
All lost!
What, must our mouths be cold?
The king and prince at prayers!
Let's assist them, For our case is theirs.
I'm out of patience.
He'll be hanged yet, Though every drop of water swear against it, And gape at wid'st to glut him.
Mercy on us!’—‘We split, we split!’—‘Farewell, my wife and children!’—‘Farewell, brother!’—‘We split, we split, we split!’ Let's all sink wi'th’ King.
Let's take leave of him.
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground—long heath, brown furze, anything.
If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin's cheek, Dashes the fire out.
Poor souls, the perished.
Had I been any god of power, I would Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her.
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee, Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing Of whence I am, nor that I am more better Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, And thy no greater father.
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts.
Tis time I should inform thee farther.
Lend thy hand, And pluck my magic garment from me.—So: [Lays down his cloak] [Lays down his cloak] Lie there, my art.—Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touched The very virtue of compassion in thee, I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul— No, not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard'st cry, which though saw'st sink.
Sit down; For thou must now know farther.
You have often Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped And left me to a bootless inquisition, Concluding ‘Stay, not yet.’ The hour's now come; The very minute bids thee ope thine ear, Obey, and be attentive.
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not Out three years old.
Certainly, sir, I can.
By what?
Tis far off, And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants.
Had I not Four or five women once that tended me?
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda.
But how is it That this lives in thy mind?
What seest thou else In the dark backward and abyss of time?
If thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here, How thou cam'st here thou mayst.
But that I do not.
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir And princess no worse issued.
O, the heavens!
What foul play had we that we came from thence?
Or blessèd was't we did?
Both, both, my girl.
By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence, But blessedly holp hither.
Please you, farther.
My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio— I pray thee mark me, that a brother should Be so perfidious—he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved, and to him put The manage of my state; as at that time Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel; those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother, And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies.
Thy false uncle— Dost thou attend me?
Sir, most heedfully.
O good sir, I do.
I pray thee mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which, but by being so retired, O'er prized all popular rate, in my false brother Awakened an evil nature; and my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him A falsehood, in its contrary as great As my trust was, which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans bound.
He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded, But what my power might else exact, like one Who having into truth, by telling of it, Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie, he did believe He was indeed the duke; out o'th’ substitution, And executing the outward face of royalty With all prerogative; hence his ambition growing— Dost thou hear?
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
To have no screen between this part he played And him he played it for; he needs will be Absolute Milan.
Me, poor man, my library Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable; confederates— So dry he was for sway—with the King of Naples To give him annual tribute, do him homage, Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend The dukedom, yet unbowed alas, poor Milan!— To most ignoble stooping.
O the heavens!
Mark his condition and th’event; then tell me If this might be a brother.
I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother: Good wombs have borne bad sons.
Now the condition.
The King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit; Which was that he, in lieu o'th’ premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan, With all the honours, on my brother; whereon, A treacherous army levied, one midnight Fated to th’ purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan, and, i'th’ dead of darkness, The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self.
Alack, for pity!
I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to't.
Hear a little further, And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now's upon's; without the which this story Were most impertinent.
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us?
Well demanded, wench; My tale provokes that question.
There they hoist us, To cry to th’ sea that roared to us, to sigh To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong.
Alack, what trouble Was I then to you!
O, a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me.
Thou didst smile, Infused with a fortitude from heaven, When I have decked the sea with drops full salt, Under my burden groaned; which raised in me An undergoing stomach, to bear up Against what should ensue.
How came we ashore?
By Providence divine.
Some food we had, and some fresh water, that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity,—who being then appointed Master of this design,—did give us; with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries, Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentelness Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.
Would I might But ever see that man!
Here in this island we arrived, and here Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit Than other princesess’ can, that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
Heavens thank you for't.
And now I pray you, sir— For still ’tis beating in my mind,—your reason For raising this sea-storm.
Know thus far north.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies Brought to this shore; and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star, whose influence If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop.
I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come!
I come To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality Hast thou, spirit, Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?
To every article.
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil Would not infect his reason?
Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and played Some tricks of desperation.
All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me: the King's son Ferdinand, With hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair— Was the first man that leapt, cried, ’Hell is empty, And all the devils are here.’ Why, that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?
Close by, my master.
But are they, Ariel, safe?
Not a hair perished; On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before; and as thou bad'st me, In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle.
The King's son have I landed by himself, Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His arms in this sad knot.
Of the King's ship, The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o'th’ fleet.
Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed; but there's more work.
What is the time o'th’ day?
Past the mid season.
At least two glasses.
The time ’twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously.
Is there more toil?
Since thou dost give me pains Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet performed me.
How now?
Moody?
What is't thou canst demand?
My liberty.
Before the time be out?
No more!
I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service, Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings.
Thou did promise To bate me a full year.
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee?
No.
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o'th’ earth When it is baked with frost.
I do not, sir.
Thou liest, malignant thing!
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop?
Hast thou forgot her?
No, sir.
Thou hast.
Where was she born?
Speak; tell me.
Sir, in Algiers.
I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget'st.
This damned witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Algiers Thou know'st was banished—for one thing she did They would not take her life.
Is not this true?
Ay, sir.
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child, And here was left by th’ sailors.
Then was this island— Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp, hag-born—not honoured with A human shape.
Yes, Caliban her son.
Dull thing, I say so: he, that Caliban Whom now I keep in service.
I thank thee, master.
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak, And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howled away twelve winters.
Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee.
That's my noble master!
What shall I do?
Go take this shape, And hither come in't: go; hence with diligence!
Exit Ariel] [Exit Ariel] Awake, dear heart, awake!
Thou hast slept well; Awake.
The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me.
Shake it off.
Come on; We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never Yields us kind answer.
Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on.
But as ’tis, We cannot miss him: he does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices That profit us.
There's wood enough within.
When?
Fine apparition!
My lord, it shall be done.
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed With raven's feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both!
A south-west blow on ye And blister you all o'er!
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou tak'st from me.
All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king, and here you sty me In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me The rest o‘th’ island.
Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness!
I have used thee, Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child.
Would't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else This isle with Calibans.
Abhorrèd slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill!
Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel, and be quick, thou'rt best, To answer other business.—Shrug'st thou, malice?
So, slave, hence!
sings] [sings] Come unto these yellow sands, And than take hands; Curtsied when you have and the kissed— The wild waves whist— Foot it featly here and there, And, sweet sprites, bear The burden.
Hark, hark!
dispersedly] Bow-wow!
Hark, hark!
I'th’ air or th’ earth?
It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon Some god o'th’ island.
No, it begins again.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell: Ding dong.
The ditty does remember my drowned father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound That the earth owes.—I hear it now above me.
What is't?
A spirit?
Lord, how it looks about!
He hath lost his fellows, And strays about to find ’em I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.
Aside] It goes on, I see, [Aside] As my soul prompts it.
to Ariel] Spirit, fine spirit, I—II free [to Ariel] Spirit, fine spirit, I—II free thee Within two days for this.
No wonder, sir, But certainly a maid.
My language!
How?
The best?
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee?
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples.
He does hear me, And that he does I weep; myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The King my father wrecked.
Alack, for mercy!
Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain.
Aside] Why speaks my father so urgently?
This [Aside] Why speaks my father so urgently?
Soft, sir!
One word more.
to Ferdinand] One word more; I [to Ferdinand] One word more; I charge thee That thou attend me.
Thou dost here usurp The name thou ow'st not; and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy, to win it From me, the lord on't.
No, as I am a man.
Follow.
No; I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power.
What, I say, My foot my tutor?
Hang not on my garments.
Sir, have pity; I'll be his surety.
Silence!
One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee.
Hush!
To th’ most of men this is a Caliban, And they to him are angels.
to Ariel] Thou shalt be free [to Ariel] Thou shalt be free As mountain winds; but then exactly do All points of my command.
Prithee, peace.
He receives comfort like cold porridge.
The visitor will not give him o'er so.
to Alonso] Sir,— [to Alonso] Sir,— [to Antonio] One: tell.
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
to Alonso] Therefore, my lord,— [to Alonso] Therefore, my lord,— [to Sebastian] Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his [to Sebastian] Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
to Gonzalo] I prithee, spare.
The old cock.
The cockerel.
The wager?
A laughter.
A match!
to Gonzalo] Though this island seem to be [to Gonzalo] Though this island seem to be desert,— [to Sebastian] Ha, ha, ha!
So, you're paid.
Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible— [to Antonio] Yet— [to Antonio] Yet— Yet— [to Sebastian] He could not miss't.
It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.
to Sebastian] Temperance was a delicate wench.
to Sebastian] Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered.
to Gonzalo] The air breathes upon us here most [to Gonzalo] The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.
to Sebastian] True, save means to live.
to Sebastian] True, Of that there's none, or little.
to Adrian] How lush and lusty the grass looks!
to Adrian] How lush and How green!
The ground indeed is tawny.
With an eye of green in't.
He misses not much.
No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.
to Adrian] But the rarity of it is, which is indeed [to Adrian] But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost beyond credit— [to Antonio] As many vouched rarities are.
to Antonio] As many [to Adrian] That our garments, being, as they were, [to Adrian] That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.
to Sebastian] If but one of his pockets could speak, [to Sebastian] If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
to Adrian] Methinks our garments are now as fresh as [to Adrian] Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the King's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen.
Not since widow Dido's time.
Widow?
A pox o'that!
How came that widow in?
Widow Dido!
to Gonzalo] ‘Widow Dido’ said you?
You make me study of that: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
Carthage?
I assure you, Carthage.
to Sebastian] His word is more than the miraculous [to Sebastian] His word is more than the miraculous harp.
He hath raised the wall, and houses too.
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple.
And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.
to Adrian] Ay.
to Adrian] [to Sebastian] Why, in good time.
to Sebastian] Why, in good time.
to Alonso] Sir, we were talking that our garments seem [to Alonso] Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is not queen.
And the rarest that e'er came there.
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
O, widow Dido!
Ay, widow Dido.
to Alonso] Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day [to Alonso] Is not, sir, my I wore it?
I mean, in a sort.
You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense.
Would I have never Married my daughter there!
For, coming thence, My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too, Who is so far from Italy removed I ne'er again shall see her.
No, no; he's gone.
to Alonso] Sir, you may thank yourself for this [to Alonso] Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather lose her to an African, Where she, at least, is banished from your eye, Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
Prithee, peace.
You were kneeled to an importuned otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience at Which end o'th’ beam should bow.
So is the dear'st o'th’ loss.
My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in—you rub the sore, When you should bring the plaster.
Very well.
And most chirurgeonly.
to Alonso] It is foul weather in us all, good sir, [to Alonso] It is foul weather in us all, good sir, When you are cloudy.
Very foul.
to Alonso] Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,— [to Alonso] Had I [to Sebastian] He'd sow't with nettle-seed.
to Sebastian] He'd sow't with Or docks, or mallows.
And were the king on't, what would I do?
I'th’ commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things, for no kind of traffic Would I admit; no name of magistrate; Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, And use of service, none; contract, succession, Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; No occupation; all men idle, all; And women too, but innocent and pure; No sovereignty— [to Antonio] Yet he would be king on't.
to Antonio] No marrying ’mong his subjects?
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
to Alonso] I would with such perfection govern, sir, [to Alonso] I would with such perfection govern, sir, T'excel the golden age.
Save his majesty!
Long live Gonzalo!
I do well believe your highness, and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.
Twas you we laughed at.
Who, in this kind of merry fooling, am nothing to you; so you may continue and laugh at nothing still.
What a blow was there given!
An it had not fallen flat-long.
You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.
We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.. [to Gonzalo] Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
to Gonzalo] Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discre- tion so weakly.
Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?
Go sleep, and hear us.
I wish mine eyes Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find They are inclined to do so.
We two, my lord, Will guard your person while you take your rest, And watch your safety.
Thank you.
Wondrous heavy.
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
It is the quality o'th’ climate.
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink?
I find not Myself disposed to sleep.
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent; They dropped, as by a thunder-stroke.
Do you not hear me speak?
I do; and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep.
What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, And yet so fast asleep.
Noble Sebastian, Thou let'st thy fortune sleep—die rather; wink'st Whiles thou art waking.
Thou dost snore distinctly; There's meaning in thy snores.
Well, I am standing water.
I'll teach you how to flow.
Do so: to ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me.
O, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it; how in stripping it.
You more invest it!
Ebbing men, indeed, Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth.
Thus, sir: Although this lord of weak remembrance, this, Who shall be of as little memory When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded— For he's a spirit of persuasion, only Professes to persuade—the king his son's alive, ’Tis as impossible that he's undrowned As he that sleeps here swims.
I have no hope That he's undrowned.
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, But doubt discovery there.
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned?
He's gone.
Then, tell me, Who's the next heir of Naples?
Claribel.
How say you?
Tis true my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis; So is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions There is some space.
There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo; I myself could make A chough of as deep chat.
O, that you bore The mind that I do!
what a sleep were this For your advancement!
Do you understand me?
Methinks I do.
And how does your content Tender your own good fortune?
For all the rest, They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk; They'll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour.
Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent: as thou got'st Milan, I'll come by Naples.
Draw thy sword—one stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest, And I the King shall love thee.
Draw together, And when I rear my hand, do you the like, To fall it on Gonzalo.
Ariel sings in Gonzalo's ear] [Ariel sings in Gonzalo's ear] While you here do snoring lie, Open-eyed conspiracy His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care, Shake off slumber, and beware.
Now, good angels Preserve the King.
waking] Why, how now?
Ho, awake!
waking] Why, how now?
to Gonzalo] Wherefore this What's the matter?
It struck mine ear most terribly.
I heard nothing.
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me.
Lead off this ground, and let's make further search For my poor son.
Heavens keep him from these beasts!
For he is sure i'th’ island.
Lead away.
All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him By inch-meal disease!
A noise of thunder heard] [A noise of thunder heard] His spirits hear me, And yet I needs must curse.
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly, I'll fall flat.
Perchance he will not mind me.
A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of not- of-the-newest Poor-John.
A strange fish!
When they will not give a dolt to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian.
Legged like a man, and his fins like arms!
Warm o'my troth!
I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.
Thunder] [Thunder] Alas, the storm is come again!
I will here, shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.
This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
What's the matter?
Have we devils here?
I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said, ‘As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground.’ And it shall be said so again, while Stephano breathes at nostrils.
This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I tak it, an ague.
Where the devil should he learn our language?
He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest.
Four legs and two voices—a most delicate monster!
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague.
Come.
Caliban drinks] Amen!
I will pour some in [Caliban drinks] thy other mouth.
Stephano!
Doth thy other mouth call me?
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth.
He pulls Trinculo out from under Caliban's cloak by the legs] Thou art very Trinculo indeed!
How cam'st thou to be the siege of this moon-calf?
can he vent Trinculos?
I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?
I hope now thou art not drowned.
Is the storm overblown?
I hid me under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of the storm.
And art thou living, Stephano?
O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped!
Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
to Trinculo] How didst thou ’scape?
How cam'st thou hither?
Swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither.
I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o'erboard—by this bottle, which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore.
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is not earthly.
Here, kiss the book.
Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose.
Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
Out o'th’ moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'th’ moon when time was.
The man i'th’ moon?
I'll show thee every fertile inch o'th’ island; And I will kiss thy foot.
I prithee, be my god.
Come on then; down, and swear.
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster.
A most scurvy monster!
I could find in my heart to beat him— Come, kiss.
I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries; I'll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, Thou wondrous man.
A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard!
I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow; And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts, Show thee a jay's nest, and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset, I'll bring thee To clustering filberts, and sometimes I'll get thee Young sea-mews from the rock.
Wilt thou go with me?
sings drunkenly] Farewell, master, farewell, farewell!
No more dams I'll make for fish Nor fetch in firing At requiring, Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish ’Ban, ’Ban, Cacaliban Has a new master—get a new man!
Freedom high-day!
High-day, freedom!
Freedom, high-day, freedom!
O brave monster!
Lead the way.
This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious, but The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead And makes my labours pleasures.
O, she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed, And he's composed of harshness.
I forget, But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, Most busil'est, when I do it.
O most dear mistress, The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do.
If you'll sit down I'll bear your logs the while.
Pray, give me that; I'll carry it to the pile.
It would become me As well as it does you; and I should do it With much more ease, for my good will is to it, And yours it is against.
aside] Poor worm, thou art infected!
You look wearily.
No, noble mistress, ’tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night.
I do beseech you— Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers— What is your name?
Miranda.
O my father, I have broke your hest to say so!
Admired Miranda!
Indeed the top of admiration, worth What's dearest to the world!
But you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature's best!
But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father's precepts I therein do forget.
Do you love me?
I, Beyond all limit of what else i'th’ world, Do love, prize, honour you.
weeping] I am a fool [weeping] I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of.
aside] Fair encounter [aside] Fair encounter Of two most rare affections!
Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between ’em!
Wherefore weep you?
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer What I desire to give, and much less take What I shall die to want.
But this is trifling, And all the more it seeks to hide itself The bigger bulk it shows.
Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
I am your wife, if you will marry me.
If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow You may deny me, but I'll be your servant Whether you will or no.
My mistress, dearest; And I thus humble ever.
My husband then?
Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
And mine, with my heart in't, and now farewell Till half an hour hence.
A thousand thousand!
I'll to my book, For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining.
Servant-monster?
The folly of this island!
They say there's but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if th'other two be brained like us, the state totters.
Where should they be set else?
He were a brave mon- ster indeed, if they were set in his tail My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack.
By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard.
Your lieutenant, if you list, he's no standard.
We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither.
Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf.
How does thy honour?
Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day?
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?
to Stephano] Lo, how he mocks me!
Wilt thou let him, my lord?
Bite him to death, I [to Stephano] Lo, lo, again!
Bite him to death, I prithee.
The poor monster's my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.
I thank my noble lord.
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
Thou liest.
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
Why, I said nothing.
Thou shalt be lord of it, and I'll server thee.
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to the party?
Thou liest; thou canst not.
What a pied ninny's this!
Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word further, and, by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o'doors and make a stockfish of thee.
Why, what did I?
I did nothing.
I'll go farther off.
Didst thou not say he lied?
Thou liest.
Do I so?
Take thou that.
Beating Trinculo] As you like [Beating Trinculo] As you like this, give me the lie another time.
Ha, ha, ha!
Beat him enough; after a little time I'll beat him too.
to Trinculo] Stand farther.
Remember First to possess his books, for without them He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command—they all do hate him As rootedly as I.
Is it so brave as lass?
Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?
Excellent.
Ay, on mine honour.
Thou mak'st me merry; I am full of pleasure.
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.
Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
Flout ’em and scout ’em, And scout ’em and flout ’em Thought is free.
That's not the tune.
What is this same?
This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.
O, forgive me my sins!
Art thou afeared?
No, monster, not I.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices That, if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked I cried to dream again.
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.
When Prospero is destroyed.
He lays it on.
Wilt come?
I'll follow, Stephano.
By your patience, I needs must rest me.
Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attached with weariness, To th’ dulling of my spirits.
Sit down and rest.
Well, let him go.

aside to Antonio] The next advantage [aside to Antonio] The next advantage Will we take throughly.
What harmony is this?
My good friends, hark!
Marvellous sweet music!
Give us kind keepers, heavens!
What were these?
A living drollery.
Now I will believe That there are unicorns, that in Arabia There is one tree, the phoenix’ throne, one phoenix At this hour reigning there.
If in Naples I should report this now, would they believe me’ If I should say I saw such islanders?
For certes these are people of the island, Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note, Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many, nay, almost any.
aside] Honest lord, [aside] Honest lord, Thou hast said well, for some of you there present Are worse than devils.
aside] Praise in departing.
aside] They vanished strangely.
Not I.
Faith, sir, you need not fear.
When we were boys, Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em Wallets of flesh?
Or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts?
Which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of.
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny, That hath to instrument this lower world And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea Hath caused to belch up you, and on this island Where man doth not inhabit, you ’mongst men Being most unfit to live.
I have made you mad, And even with suchlike valour men hang and drown Their proper selves.
You fools!
If you could hurt, Your swords are now too massy for your strengths And will not be uplifted.
But remember, For that's my business to you, that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero; Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it, Him and his innocent child; for which foul deed, The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures, Against your peace.
I'th’ name of something holy sir, why stand you In this strange stare?
Therefore my son i'th’ ooze is bedded, and I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded, And with him there lie mudded.
But one fiend at a time, I'll fight their legions o'er.
I'll be thy second.
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly, And hinder them from this ecstasy May now provoke them to.
to Ferdinand] If I have too austerely punished you, [to Ferdinand] If I have too Your compensation makes amends, for I Have given you here a third of mine own life— Or that for which I live—who once again I tender to thy hand.
I do believe it Against an oracle.
What, Ariel!
My industrious servant, Ariel!
What would my potent master?
Here I am.
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform, and I must use you In such another trick.
Presently?
Ay, with a twink.
Before you can say ‘Come’ and ‘Go,’ And breathe twice and cry ‘So, so,’ Each one, tripping on his toe Will be here with mop and mow.
Do you love me, master?
No?
Dearly, my delicate Ariel.
Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call.
Well, I conceive.
I warrant you, sir; The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardour of my liver.
Well.— Now come, my Ariel!
Bring a corollary, Rather than want a spirit.
Appear and pertly!
No tongue, all eyes!
Be silent.
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
A contract of true love to celebrate; And some donation freely to estate On the blest lovers.
Tell me, heavenly bow, If Venus or her son, as thou dost know, Do now attend the queen.
Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got, Her and her blind boy's scandaled company I have forsworn.
Of her society Be not afraid.
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and miad, Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen's torch be lighted—but in vain.
High'st queen of state, Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
How does my bounteous sister?
Go with me To bless this twain, that they may Prospus be And honoured in their issue.
Honour, riches, marriage-blessing, Long continuance, and increasing, Hourly joys be still upon you!
Juno sings her blessings upon you.
Earth's increase, foison plenty, Barns and garners never empty, Vines and clust'ring bunches growing, Plants and goodly burden bowing; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest!
Scarcity and want shall shun you, Ceres’ blessing so is on you.
Spirits, which by mine art I have from their confines call'd to enact My present fancies.
Sweet now, silence!
Your nymphs, called naiads of the wandering brooks, With your sedged crowns and over-harmless looks, Leave your crisp channels and on this green land Answer your summons; Juno does command.
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary, Come hither from the furrow and be merry; Make holiday, your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing.
to the spirits] Well done!
no more!
These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits, and Are melted into air, into thin air; And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind.
Be not disturbed with my infirmity.
We wish your peace.
Thy thoughts I cleave to.
What's thy pleasure?
Spirit, We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
Say again: where didst thou leave these variets?
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking; So fun of valour that they smote the air For breathing in their faces, beat the ground For kissing of their feet; yet always bending Towards their project.
This was well done, my bird.
A devil, a born devil, on whose nature Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains, Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost, And, as with age his body uglier grows, So his mind cankers.
I will plague them all, Even to roaring.
Come, hang them on this line.
Monster, you fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the Jack with us.
Monster, I do smell all horse-piss, at which my nose is in great indignation.
If I should take a displeasure against you, look you— Thou wert but a lost monster.
I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears for my labour.
Prithee, my king, be quiet.
Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban, For aye thy foot-licker.
seeing the apparel] O King Stephano!
O peer!
O worthy Stephano!
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!
Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
putting on a garment] O, ho, monster!
Thy grace shall have it.
The dropsy drown this fool!
What do you mean To dote thus on such luggage?
Let't alone, And do the murder first.
If he awake, From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches, Make us strange stuff.
I will have none on't.
We shall lose our time, And all be turned to barnacles, or to apes With foreheads villanous low.
Go to, carry this.
And this.
Ay, and this.

Hark, they roar!
Let them be hunted soundly.
How's the day?
On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord, You said our work should cease.
I did say so When first I raised the tempest.
Say, my spirit, How fares the King and's followers?
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir In the lime-grove which weather-fends your cell; They cannot budge till your release.
Dost thou think so, spirit?
Mine would, sir, were I human.
Go release them, Ariel.
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore, And they shall be themselves.
I'll fetch them, sir.
Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves, And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him When he comes back; you demi-puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid, Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimmed The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds, And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war—to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar: graves at my command Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth By my so potent art.

Why, that's my dainty Ariel!
I drink the air before me, and return Or ere your pulse twice beat.
All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement Inhabits here.
Some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country!

No.
to Antonio] For you, most wicked sir, whom to call [to Antonio] For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know Thou must restore.
If thou beest Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation; How thou hast met us here, who three hours since Were wrecked upon this shore; where I have lost— How sharp the point of this remembrance is!— My dear son Ferdinand.
I am woe for't, sir.
Irreparable is the loss, and patience Says it is past her cure.
I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid, And rest myself content.
You the like loss?
As great to me as late; and supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter.
A daughter?
When did you lose your daughter?
In this last tempest.
I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth, these words Are natural breath.
But howsoe'er you have Been jostled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero, and that very Duke Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely Upon this shore, where you were wrecked, was landed To be the lord on't.
No more yet of this, For ‘tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast, nor Befitting this first meeting.
Here have I few attendants And subjects none abroad.
Pray you, look in.
My dukedom since you have given me again, I will requite you with as good a thing; At least bring forth a wonder to content ye As much as me my dukedom.
Sweet lord, you play me false.
No, my dear'st love, I would not for the world.
Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, And I would call it fair play.
If this prove A vision of the island, one dear son Shall I twice lose.
A most high miracle.
Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about!
Arise and say how thou cam'st here.
O wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is!
O brave new world That has such people in't!
Tis new to thee.
to Ferdinand] What is this maid with whom thou [to Ferdinand] What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Sir, she is mortal; But by immortal providence she's mine.
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one.
She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown, But never saw before; of whom I have Received a second life; and second father This lady makes him to me.
I am hers.
But O, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness!
I have inly wept, Or should have spoke ere this.
I say amen, Gonzalo!
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become kings of Naples?
O rejoice Beyond a common joy!
And set it down With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis, And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle; and all of ourselves, When no man was his own [to Ferdinand and Miranda] Give me your hands.
Be it so!
Amen!
Here is more of us!
I prophesied if a gallows were on land This fellow could not drown.
to the Boatswain] Now, [to the Boatswain] Now, blasphemy, That swear'st grace o'erboard: not an oath on shore?

What is the news?
The best news is that we have safely found Our King and company; the next, our ship, Which but three glasses since we gave out split, Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea.

to Alonso] How fares my gracious sir?
There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not.
Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune.
Coragio, bully- monster, coragio!
If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here's a goodly sight.
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
How fine my master is!
I am afraid He will chastise me.
Ha, ha!
What things are these, my lord Antonio?
Will money buy ’em?
Very like; one of them Is a plain fish, and no doubt marketable.
I shall be pinched to death.
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones.
I shall not fear fly- blowing.
Why, how now, Stephano?
O, touch me not!
I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
You'd be king o's the isle, sirrah?
I should have been a sore one then.
